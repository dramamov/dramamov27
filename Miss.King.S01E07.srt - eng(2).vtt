WEBVTT

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.865
You're Seigo Todou, right?

00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:12.700
Yes?

00:00:12.784 --> 00:00:17.580
So, could I ask some questions
about Asuka Kunimi?

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:24.003
Do you recognize
the person in this picture?

00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:32.345
This is Asuka Kunimi. Am I correct?

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:38.977
She's your disciple and the daughter who
Shoichi Yuuki had abandoned.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.145
No…

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:42.230
I'm not sure what you mean.

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:47.318
But you were there too.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.201
Asuka Kunimi resented Shoichi Yuuki.

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:58.037
She was there to take revenge.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.707
Is that correct, Mr. Todou?

00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:06.713
You were expelled from the world of shogi
for assaulting Shoichi.

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:09.966
I'm curious
how you were involved with her.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.385
Would you mind sharing?

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.016
You're wrong.

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:23.104
This is my revenge.

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:28.776
She's just a piece I'm playing.

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:41.956
If Asuka Kunimi becomes a kishi,
it would cause chaos.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.210
The first female kishi turned out to be
an attempted murderer?

00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:47.587
ATTEMPTED MURDER?

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:52.592
Is everything written
in this article true?

00:01:53.718 --> 00:01:55.678
SCOOP! SECRET CHILD

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:02.060
Asuka Kunimi is…

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.438
indeed my daughter.

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.398
-So it was true.
-A secret child.

00:02:07.482 --> 00:02:10.485
However, she is not a secret child.
Nothing illegitimate.

00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:15.114
She's legally registered
as part of the Kunimi family.

00:02:15.907 --> 00:02:18.826
Why have you kept this hidden until now?

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:20.620
Well…

00:02:23.456 --> 00:02:24.874
It was my decision.

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.960
This is your family's scandal.

00:02:27.043 --> 00:02:28.586
Keep it out of the association.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.340
It's the biggest scandal ever
in the history of shogi.

00:02:37.262 --> 00:02:39.347
It's blowing up.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.765
REAL-LIFE REVENGE DRAMA?

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:43.726
A DROPOUT GOING ROGUE

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.604
THE TERRORIST OF THE SHOGI WORLD

00:02:47.522 --> 00:02:49.065
Apparently you're a terrorist.

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:52.402
I came up with this on the spot.
Not a bad plot, huh?

00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:54.570
How can you joke around like that?

00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:55.947
If we let them believe that

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.449
I was the mastermind
and you were just manipulated,

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:01.160
they probably won't cancel
your admission test.

00:03:01.244 --> 00:03:04.247
From now on,
you and I are complete strangers.

00:03:10.712 --> 00:03:13.423
Listen, this is your chance.

00:03:14.173 --> 00:03:19.137
You may become the first female kishi.
All eyes are already on you.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.764
What if you totally dominate the test?

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:24.225
You'll make headlines.

00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:32.567
The more attention you draw,

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.069
the shogi world
won't be able to ignore you.

00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:41.326
Win all the games.

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:45.330
That's the fastest way
to get to Shoichi Yuuki.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.709
I know.

00:03:50.418 --> 00:03:52.545
You don't have to tell me.

00:03:55.757 --> 00:04:02.722
KISHI ADMISSION TEST, BEST OF FIVE
FIRST GAME

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:09.354
In the shogi association's
hundred-year history,

00:04:09.437 --> 00:04:13.358
we have yet to see the
birth of a female kishi.

00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:14.817
Will history be made today?

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:19.155
Asuka Kunimi challenges
the kishi admission test, best of five.

00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:24.494
If she wins three games,
she'll be the very first female kishi.

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:42.303
ROOK

00:04:53.064 --> 00:04:54.232
How's Asuka doing?

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:57.860
Keep steady.

00:04:59.112 --> 00:05:01.072
Take it slow at first.

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.283
Sorry, we're not open yet--

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:07.453
-Hello! Whoa. He's really here.
-Coming in!

00:05:07.537 --> 00:05:08.830
-What?
-I see.

00:05:08.913 --> 00:05:11.249
Got us a terrorist!

00:05:11.332 --> 00:05:13.251
Shall we detain him?

00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:14.293
-Who are you?
-Nice.

00:05:22.218 --> 00:05:24.011
Hey, who the heck are you?

00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:25.680
You're a bad guy, right?

00:05:25.763 --> 00:05:30.351
You're gonna get taken down and exposed.
This will go viral!

00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:41.779
We've got a bounty on your head
that's all ours!

00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:43.656
-Hey, where are you going?
-Whoa, hey!

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:44.574
Whoa!

00:05:44.657 --> 00:05:47.034
- Hey!
-Stop it!

00:05:47.118 --> 00:05:48.202
What the heck--

00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:50.079
-He's dangerous!
-Watch out!

00:05:50.163 --> 00:05:51.205
Get over here!

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:55.209
-Get down!
-Get off me!

00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:03.509
Seigo!

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:06.679
-Hey!
-Are you kidding?

00:06:06.762 --> 00:06:07.680
Seigo!

00:06:08.347 --> 00:06:09.307
Stop it!

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.934
-Stop filming!
-Come on!

00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:26.073
I resign.

00:06:33.414 --> 00:06:34.874
Great game, Ms. Kunimi.

00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:37.126
That was amazing. By the way…

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.379
What advice did you get
from your teacher, Todou 7-dan?

00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:46.219
I don't have a mentor with such a name.

00:06:46.302 --> 00:06:48.179
Oh, but…

00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:51.849
Good game.

00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:52.934
Great game.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.196
What happened?

00:07:25.508 --> 00:07:28.678
Ms. Reiko? Ms. Reiko!

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.101
Ms. Reiko!

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:37.186
Ms. Reiko!

00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:06.882
Ms. Reiko!

00:08:08.384 --> 00:08:09.343
Asuka.

00:08:09.427 --> 00:08:10.720
Are you okay?

00:08:10.803 --> 00:08:11.762
All this…

00:08:12.263 --> 00:08:14.015
What happened here?

00:08:14.932 --> 00:08:18.102
Seigo was attacked.

00:08:18.686 --> 00:08:19.645
What?

00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:23.774
Some idiots stormed in, fired up by
the article and the online hype.

00:08:23.858 --> 00:08:25.067
No…

00:08:25.818 --> 00:08:28.404
Is Mr. Todou all right?
What about the police?

00:08:28.487 --> 00:08:30.031
He's fine.

00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:34.035
We didn't call the police.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.536
Why not?

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.998
He said that if this blows up,
they might cancel your test.

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:42.710
But they did all this--

00:08:42.793 --> 00:08:45.630
We're fine. No one got hurt either.

00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:47.548
Well…

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.594
I'll have to close up for a while though.

00:08:57.016 --> 00:08:59.935
Seigo won't be back for some time either.

00:09:01.812 --> 00:09:03.564
It's not safe for him.

00:09:03.648 --> 00:09:05.149
Where is he now?

00:09:10.404 --> 00:09:11.656
I can't tell you.

00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:17.036
He said, "Forget about me.
Just focus on the test."

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.832
He doesn't want to be seen with you.

00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:26.671
He's scared he might cause more trouble
and ruin everything for you.

00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:31.300
What an idiot.

00:09:40.601 --> 00:09:44.897
THE ADMISSION TEST IS STILL HAPPENING?

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.235
A TERRORIST WHO'S A KISHI? WHAT A JOKE!

00:09:49.318 --> 00:09:54.615
Social media is still blowing up.

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:56.367
Shouldn't we cancel the admission test?

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.035
That would only add fuel to the fire.

00:09:58.119 --> 00:10:01.038
What if an insider leaked the information?

00:10:01.622 --> 00:10:04.291
Who would do that in the first place?

00:10:10.715 --> 00:10:17.638
I'm impressed they made up a whole story
from screenshots of the CCTV footage.

00:10:18.597 --> 00:10:20.766
Why did you leak it?

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.895
Because it's more fun that way.

00:10:33.195 --> 00:10:34.947
A nice change, isn't it?

00:10:35.823 --> 00:10:39.076
To shake things up a bit
in this quiet shogi world.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.997
And Asuka Kunimi, she's finished.

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:46.625
The birth of the first female kishi
isn't going to happen.

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:48.711
End of story.

00:10:50.087 --> 00:10:51.005
You can thank me.

00:10:51.088 --> 00:10:52.965
This isn't the end of the story.

00:10:53.758 --> 00:10:56.010
You put our positions at stake.

00:10:56.093 --> 00:10:58.345
You knew it would, didn't you?

00:10:58.429 --> 00:10:59.764
So why did you do that?

00:11:13.652 --> 00:11:15.112
Why do you think I did it?

00:11:23.746 --> 00:11:26.999
Dad, why do you think I did it?

00:11:35.508 --> 00:11:37.384
You never get it, huh?

00:11:39.011 --> 00:11:40.471
How your own kid feels.

00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:44.475
Tatsuya. Wait.

00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:46.602
Tatsuya!

00:11:51.815 --> 00:11:55.861
KISHI ADMISSION TEST, BEST OF FIVE
SECOND GAME

00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:58.364
EIJI NOMURA VS. ASUKA KUNIMI

00:11:58.447 --> 00:12:00.658
WILL WE HAVE THE FIRST FEMALE KISHI?

00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:52.042
I resign.

00:12:55.296 --> 00:12:56.547
Yes.

00:12:57.673 --> 00:12:58.799
Yes!

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:01.760
It looked like you had a tough time.

00:13:01.844 --> 00:13:02.970
What was on your mind?

00:13:03.846 --> 00:13:07.725
Were you affected
by the earlier news about Todou 7-dan?

00:13:11.812 --> 00:13:13.647
My opponent was strong.

00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:36.420
When you're in a match, think only about
the opponent in front of you.

00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:56.190
KISHI ADMISSION TEST, BEST OF FIVE
THIRD GAME

00:14:07.743 --> 00:14:09.036
I resign.

00:14:12.748 --> 00:14:15.000
Kunimi amateur, lost two in a row.

00:14:15.084 --> 00:14:17.628
Another loss, and she'll be disqualified.

00:14:20.297 --> 00:14:26.053
Physically, women do face
different issues than men.

00:14:26.136 --> 00:14:27.137
Right.

00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:29.890
I suppose this is the harsh reality.

00:14:31.558 --> 00:14:34.687
-Tough game, Ms. Kunimi.
-Could I have a word?

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.897
You're cornered. How do you feel?

00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:39.108
We heard that Todou 7-dan went missing.

00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:41.068
Have you spoken with him?

00:14:41.694 --> 00:14:44.321
Why don't you say something?

00:14:44.405 --> 00:14:46.573
Please, just one word.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.919
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

00:15:03.424 --> 00:15:04.550
Welcome home.

00:15:12.933 --> 00:15:14.226
I'm sorry.

00:15:16.437 --> 00:15:18.313
-Asuka--
-Good night.

00:15:55.726 --> 00:15:58.854
When I play shogi,
everyone ends up miserable.

00:15:58.937 --> 00:16:02.024
Hey, cut that crap.

00:16:02.107 --> 00:16:03.609
Your reason to live is right before you.

00:16:03.692 --> 00:16:05.319
Play shogi.

00:16:05.986 --> 00:16:06.987
Asuka Kunimi.

00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:10.199
Forget what your mom wanted.
It's your life.

00:16:10.282 --> 00:16:12.159
She is my…

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.079
What are you?

00:16:15.162 --> 00:16:18.999
Try making me any more miserable.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.311
Asuka.

00:16:42.606 --> 00:16:43.690
Asuka.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:49.446
You once said, "When I play shogi,
everyone ends up miserable."

00:16:58.872 --> 00:17:00.457
I don't think that's true.

00:17:01.542 --> 00:17:03.460
I'm sure Seigo would agree with me.

00:17:13.929 --> 00:17:16.932
I need to clean up soon.

00:17:17.015 --> 00:17:18.684
Can you bring him back?

00:17:19.184 --> 00:17:21.311
He won't listen to me.

00:17:31.613 --> 00:17:35.325
Whatever's eating at you, throw it at him.

00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:38.620
Good night.

00:18:08.734 --> 00:18:13.822
SAWADA MANUFACTURING

00:18:33.717 --> 00:18:35.385
What are you doing here?

00:18:35.469 --> 00:18:37.095
The tabloids might spot you here

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:38.764
and make another scandal.

00:18:54.821 --> 00:18:55.948
Here.

00:18:57.532 --> 00:18:58.784
Thank you.

00:19:10.003 --> 00:19:12.714
Hey, you look a little different.

00:19:13.257 --> 00:19:14.174
What?

00:19:14.841 --> 00:19:17.678
What happened to your face
since I last saw you?

00:19:18.512 --> 00:19:19.596
Plastic surgery?

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.806
No!

00:19:21.431 --> 00:19:23.684
Right, you're busy losing games.

00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:25.143
No time, huh?

00:19:34.403 --> 00:19:37.781
Apparently,
people call me a terrorist now.

00:19:38.448 --> 00:19:40.826
Social media is a total hellscape.

00:19:42.452 --> 00:19:46.373
You'll also be targeted
if you're seen with me.

00:19:46.915 --> 00:19:48.417
So drink your tea and go.

00:20:06.435 --> 00:20:09.354
Mr. Todou, you once told me…

00:20:10.272 --> 00:20:11.148
What?

00:20:11.773 --> 00:20:15.610
"Try making me any more miserable."

00:20:15.694 --> 00:20:19.906
Try making me any more miserable.

00:20:22.409 --> 00:20:23.577
How about now?

00:20:24.244 --> 00:20:25.871
Are you miserable?

00:20:27.914 --> 00:20:30.667
The whole country hates you.

00:20:31.376 --> 00:20:33.045
They call you evil.

00:20:34.087 --> 00:20:37.007
They attack you and harm you.

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:42.054
Are you miserable?

00:20:47.434 --> 00:20:50.395
Yes, I am miserable.

00:20:51.813 --> 00:20:53.690
It sucks. It's your fault.

00:20:53.774 --> 00:20:55.984
Not just me. Reiko too.

00:20:56.068 --> 00:20:57.444
They destroyed her place.

00:20:57.527 --> 00:21:00.072
I know! It's awful.

00:21:00.155 --> 00:21:01.365
Total hell.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.038
But…

00:21:10.415 --> 00:21:11.750
It will get better.

00:21:13.043 --> 00:21:15.712
Ms. Reiko's store and your injury.

00:21:16.421 --> 00:21:17.422
It will be fixed.

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:20.258
I will fix it.

00:21:20.842 --> 00:21:21.718
What are you--

00:21:21.802 --> 00:21:25.180
I will play shogi and fix you both.

00:21:26.807 --> 00:21:28.016
So…

00:21:29.851 --> 00:21:32.104
come fight with me.

00:21:35.524 --> 00:21:37.275
Stop hiding.

00:21:38.151 --> 00:21:39.569
Stop running.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.367
You are my teacher.

00:21:49.413 --> 00:21:54.084
Come with me all the way
to the end of this hell!

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:08.348
If you two are not miserable,
I'll be fine too.

00:22:14.813 --> 00:22:17.274
What are you talking about?

00:22:17.357 --> 00:22:18.859
You're insane!

00:22:23.697 --> 00:22:25.198
Can you do this?

00:22:26.241 --> 00:22:27.450
I can.

00:22:29.244 --> 00:22:31.371
You get depressed.

00:22:31.454 --> 00:22:32.831
You get pumped up.

00:22:33.665 --> 00:22:36.126
All on your own. Selfish brat.

00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:47.512
The next opponent
is a rookie who just ranked 4-dan.

00:22:47.596 --> 00:22:48.763
We'll take him down.

00:22:49.681 --> 00:22:51.016
How's your injury?

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.560
Fully healed.

00:23:01.193 --> 00:23:02.986
Ouch, it hurts!

00:23:03.069 --> 00:23:04.571
Oh, it's not healed after all.

00:23:06.031 --> 00:23:07.240
It has.

00:23:07.866 --> 00:23:08.950
Let's go.

00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:34.267
Welcome home.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.521
I'm home.

00:23:44.027 --> 00:23:45.403
Okay, you two.

00:23:45.487 --> 00:23:47.530
-Let's start cleaning.
-Okay.

00:23:48.698 --> 00:23:50.951
Seigo, put these back up.

00:23:51.534 --> 00:23:52.869
-These?
-Yes.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.955
-You can do it!
-Okay.

00:23:56.206 --> 00:23:57.415
Heave-ho!

00:23:58.124 --> 00:23:59.960
Give it your all!

00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:02.420
My left arm still hurts.

00:24:03.046 --> 00:24:04.631
Didn't you say you've healed?

00:24:04.714 --> 00:24:05.590
Has he?

00:24:06.091 --> 00:24:06.925
I have!

00:24:07.008 --> 00:24:09.219
Great! Go on then.

00:24:10.303 --> 00:24:12.055
Ouch, it really hurts!

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.712
You like it?

00:24:51.761 --> 00:24:58.143
KISHI ADMISSION TEST, BEST OF FIVE
FOURTH GAME

00:25:47.025 --> 00:25:49.611
It is now the scheduled time.

00:25:49.694 --> 00:25:51.404
Please begin.

00:25:51.988 --> 00:25:54.574
Let's have a good game.

00:26:06.336 --> 00:26:09.839
The fourth game of the
kishi admission test has begun.

00:26:30.819 --> 00:26:32.112
I resign.

00:26:35.323 --> 00:26:37.909
What an impressive game!

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.745
Tsuyuki 4-dan was completely at a loss.

00:26:41.246 --> 00:26:43.456
Asuka Kunimi, amateur, dominates.

00:26:45.125 --> 00:26:47.836
She's completely different
from the last game.

00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:50.755
-Her reading of the board was exceptional.
-Yes.

00:26:51.798 --> 00:26:53.675
Wow, amazing!

00:26:54.509 --> 00:26:56.553
She did it! Asuka!

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.569
-UGH, SHE WON.
-A CRIMINAL BECOMING A KISHI?

00:27:12.652 --> 00:27:14.904
-SHE DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE A PRO.
-SHE'S NOT A CRIMINAL!

00:27:14.988 --> 00:27:17.115
-FIRST FEMALE KISHI IS BORN!
-STOP HER!

00:27:17.198 --> 00:27:19.159
BOO-HOO. IT'S OVER FOR THE SHOGI WORLD.

00:27:19.242 --> 00:27:21.995
TAKE AWAY HER RIGHT TO CHALLENGE
BEFORE SHE REALLY KILLS SOMEONE.

00:27:22.078 --> 00:27:23.830
DON'T TAINT THE HISTORY OF SHOGI.

00:27:25.415 --> 00:27:30.753
We sincerely apologize
for the public disturbance caused.

00:27:31.254 --> 00:27:37.343
Many have reached out to question us about
Asuka Kunimi's kishi admission test,

00:27:37.427 --> 00:27:40.180
and whether she should be eligible.

00:27:40.847 --> 00:27:45.852
Today, Chairman Shoichi Yuuki

00:27:45.935 --> 00:27:48.855
will address this matter.

00:27:50.815 --> 00:27:51.983
Yes.

00:27:53.651 --> 00:27:55.153
As reported,

00:27:56.821 --> 00:27:58.281
Asuka Kunimi is…

00:28:02.994 --> 00:28:04.787
my daughter.

00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:13.087
Some media mentioned
there was an attempted murder.

00:28:14.464 --> 00:28:18.468
That part is completely false.

00:28:19.469 --> 00:28:21.221
Are you covering for your daughter?

00:28:22.972 --> 00:28:24.182
Also…

00:28:25.183 --> 00:28:29.812
the person who leaked this information…

00:28:34.192 --> 00:28:36.110
is my son…

00:28:37.987 --> 00:28:39.531
Tatsuya Yuuki.

00:28:39.614 --> 00:28:41.157
What does that mean?

00:28:43.701 --> 00:28:49.499
I sincerely apologize for all
the trouble my children have caused.

00:28:58.216 --> 00:28:59.926
I promise…

00:29:01.469 --> 00:29:03.847
I will take full responsibility

00:29:04.764 --> 00:29:06.516
and end this scandal.

00:29:08.351 --> 00:29:10.061
For Tatsuya…

00:29:11.312 --> 00:29:15.483
he will be suspended
from playing shogi indefinitely.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.070
As for Asuka Kunimi…

00:29:21.072 --> 00:29:23.867
we will continue her kishi admission test.

00:29:24.868 --> 00:29:29.873
However, I will be personally serving…

00:29:32.625 --> 00:29:35.169
as the examiner for the final match.

00:29:38.548 --> 00:29:39.716
Furthermore…

00:29:41.551 --> 00:29:43.469
after that game…

00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:46.472
I will…

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.937
retire from shogi.

00:29:54.814 --> 00:29:55.815
KISHI ADMISSION TEST
EMERGENCY CONFERENCE

00:29:55.899 --> 00:29:56.858
Are you serious?

00:29:56.941 --> 00:29:58.860
This is getting insane.

00:29:58.943 --> 00:30:01.571
Does this mean he'll be her next opponent?

00:30:02.113 --> 00:30:05.199
Couldn't ask for a better setup. Right?

00:30:29.098 --> 00:30:31.184
I will give my all…

00:30:33.102 --> 00:30:35.271
to defeat Asuka Kunimi.

00:30:55.583 --> 00:30:59.879
KEIKO AND ASUKA.

00:30:59.963 --> 00:31:03.424
I LEFT THE TWO OF THEM,
MY MOST BELOVED FAMILY.

00:31:13.935 --> 00:31:16.062
These are the pages I removed
from the manuscript.

00:31:16.145 --> 00:31:18.731
My daughter, at seven, already had a gift.

00:31:18.815 --> 00:31:22.068
I was jealous and scared.

00:31:22.151 --> 00:31:26.155
I was so pissed!

00:31:26.239 --> 00:31:27.323
Mr. Todou.

00:31:27.407 --> 00:31:29.659
This is a family feud.

00:31:30.243 --> 00:31:32.537
The whole nation
is on Shoichi Yuuki's side.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.122
I don't care.

00:31:34.205 --> 00:31:37.458
I'll be by your side
all the way to the end of hell.

00:31:38.209 --> 00:31:39.502
Let's beat up your dad.

00:31:41.212 --> 00:31:42.463
Well,

00:31:44.007 --> 00:31:45.425
let's begin.

00:31:46.759 --> 00:31:48.553
