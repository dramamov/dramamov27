00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.200
So I did kill him?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.719
Yes.

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:40.000
You killed him.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.359
But still,

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:42.920
we need the court's trial.

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:43.920
No need.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.920
Just sentence me now.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.959
My marriage died long ago.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:49.920
Since I became disabled,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.560
my life ended then.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.920
A life for a life.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.920
Just execute me.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:57.560
It'll be a relief to me.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.719
If you truly broke the law,

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.000
the law won't easily

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.120
let a criminal go.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.760
But if you're innocent,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.640
the law won't just

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.799
wrong any innocent person.

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:09.199
Calm down.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.319
Don't I look calm to you?

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.960
Enough.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.159
I confess.

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:17.199
I killed Zeng Jie.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.919
Bai Xiaoling,

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.719
just answer the questions.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.879
Given the proof we got,

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.719
we can't rule out the possibility

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.199
that you acted in self-defense,

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.240
causing Zeng Jie dead.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.800
What we need is the truth.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.240
The guilty

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.439
can't escape justice.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.240
Likewise,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.680
the innocent

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.520
mustn't be wronged.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.759
There's no wrong

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.199
or self-defense here.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.840
In that room,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.960
there were only Zeng Jie and me.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.240
He's dead and it means I killed him.

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:46.360
If I had died,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.639
then he killed me.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.719
If I were the dead one now,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.199
would you still believe

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.680
Zeng Jie was innocent?

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.120
Just execute me.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.919
I told you,

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.199
my life ended then.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.759
Bai Xiaoling,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.439
value your life.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.400
Should I sob and wail,

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:11.520
telling you all

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.080
that I'm innocent

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.639
and didn't kill anyone,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.400
to prove I value my life?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.520
No.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.840
I have nothing to explain.

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:28.639
I've made up my mind.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:40.719
What's wrong with you?

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:42.719
Handled many cases,

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:43.840
yet I've never seen this.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.360
She refused

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.080
to defend herself.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.280
(Excessive self-defense?)

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.319
Wait,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.919
how could it be so?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.000
Listen.

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.479
My client

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.280
survived a car accident.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.800
When a frail and vulnerable woman

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:10.120
who can't even stand

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.080
faces against

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.199
a strong, able-bodied man,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.439
it's a miracle
that she can defend herself.

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.120
Excessive self-defense?

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.680
Li De.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.199
Before Bai Xiaoling went on

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.000
that trip,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.199
I repeatedly warned you

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:22.680
Zeng Jie might harm her.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.240
Now Zeng Jie is dead.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.439
Why are you doubting

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.439
Bai Xiaoling now?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.680
Big Hui, calm down.

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:28.759
Wait,

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.240
how did you get in here?

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.720
Well...

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.680
Let me explain.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.279
Allow me to introduce,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.759
Yang Zhenghui,

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.360
my assistant.

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:39.120
Think I don't know him?

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:40.759
He's just a video creator.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.399
Your assistant? Since when?

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:43.360
Right now.

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:45.240
The employment contract.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.160
Sign here.

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:48.360
I've already stamped it.

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.240
Our law firm

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:52.720
is rule-abiding.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.360
We handle things

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.800
legally,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.439
legitimately, and validly.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.519
The business cards

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:59.600
are all ready.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.360
Here.

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.959
Take it.

00:05:04.256 --> 00:05:05.504
(Law Firm, Yang Zhenghui)

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.600
Your 'Hui' for 'Light'

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.639
or for 'Sunshine'?

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.279
'Light'.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.000
Right.

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.199
Then I got it right.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:13.759
See?

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:15.759
We are very meticulous.

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:17.800
Indeed.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.040
Excuse me,

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:24.759
no smoking here.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.680
I know.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.399
I'm not smoking.

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:30.319
But I enjoy

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.120
putting on airs.

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.199
Just get to the point.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.519
Why the pretentious act?

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.879
Yes.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.399
Get to the point.

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:41.600
During

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:43.120
Zeng Jie's marriage

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.600
to my client,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.040
he repeatedly cheated on her.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.920
The number of his affairs

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:48.879
was extensive.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.720
Look,

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:50.920
these

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.399
only show part of them.

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:55.160
My client

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.720
collected these long ago

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:58.560
and had considered divorce.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.319
However,

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.600
she's too kind-hearted

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:03.160
to make up her mind.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.800
Towards Zeng Jie and their marriage,

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:07.839
she still had false hope.

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:09.959
But Zeng Jie

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.439
didn't want a divorce.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.240
Why?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.600
Because he

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:15.399
lived off my client's

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:16.399
family wealth

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:17.639
to maintain a lifestyle

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.399
far beyond his financial capabilities.

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:21.800
The biggest problem is

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:23.120
that he might become

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.600
the loser in the divorce.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.639
That's why I believe

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.839
he had motive to kill Bai Xiaoling.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:29.040
Only through her death

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.279
could he seize

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.639
my client's assets

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.279
for himself.

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:35.319
Secondly,

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.120
on November 24th last year,

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:39.079
Zeng Jie's studio

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.600
in Shuiyuan Village

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.120
caught fire.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.319
Of course, Officer Li,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.920
you've surely investigated this,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.480
right?

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.680
No direct evidence,

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:48.560
but I believe

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:49.439
the fire

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.199
targeted my client.

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:52.720
Zeng Jie started the fire

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.160
after learning that Bai Xiaoling

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:55.800
was resting

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:57.480
on the third floor.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.319
And he

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:00.600
prepared the full escape kit

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.120
for himself.

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.839
Luckily, Bai Xiaoling

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.319
left the party early

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.720
and escaped.

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:09.480
Well...

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.519
Though no

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.439
concrete evidence,

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.720
it's still a crucial clue.

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:15.240
A month after the fire,

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:16.319
Bai Xiaoling

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.879
was involved in a car accident

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.959
that left her disabled.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:20.360
But guess what?

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:21.639
The day before,

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:23.879
Zeng Jie took her car

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.920
for maintenance.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.360
She showed me

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:28.879
chat records with her friends,

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:30.279
confirming that brake failure

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.439
caused the crash.

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:33.319
Exactly.

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.120
A perfectly maintained car

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.199
has brake failure?

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:38.279
Done?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.560
We actually

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.519
know all these.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.600
So,

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:43.839
you are

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.240
very meticulous.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:45.959
Moreover,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.720
that Lin Fang...

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.600
The Lin Fang case

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.839
is unrelated to this case.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.279
And it's currently

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.360
in the speculative stage.

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:53.240
I'm just suggesting,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.000
no offense.

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:56.639
You need

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:59.079
to dig deep into Zeng Jie.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.439
I think

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:01.519
it is very likely

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.759
he was not a first-time killer,

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:06.000
but a repeat offender.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.639
Zeng Jie is dead?

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.120
Yes.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:22.680
What...

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:25.439
What a pity.

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:26.879
He couldn't be punished by law.

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:28.639
But now, Bai Xiaoling

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:29.680
is in trouble.

00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:32.032
The court might sentence her
for excessive self-defense.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.440
She has plenty of money.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.720
Have her hire a lawyer.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.360
She has a lawyer,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.159
but it can't solve everything.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:40.679
I was thinking...

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.600
I was thinking if...

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.279
at this time,

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:45.679
we can clarify everything

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.360
about Lin Fang,

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:47.639
it may help

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:48.320
this case.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.399
Want Lin Shan to go to police?

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.519
If it's possible,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.720
that would be best.

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:55.279
Let's not talk about

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:56.440
whether he'd do this.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.840
Even if he does,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.000
even if he goes,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.279
what would he say?

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.799
Want him to turn himself in?

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:06.960
If that's what you want,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440
convince him yourself.

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:11.000
I can't do this.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.399
And I don't know how.

00:09:14.016 --> 00:09:15.040
(Zhang Xiaohong)

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.759
Not surprised.

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:20.960
But I can't convince Lin Shan

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.639
into that.

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:23.759
This case happened many years ago.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.279
Even if we find out

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:26.600
Zeng Jie's behind it,

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:27.799
it wouldn't help much

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:28.759
to Xiaoling's case now.

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:31.240
Logically speaking,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.279
it helps.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.039
Eat up.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.120
The tripe is overdone.

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:44.200
Today's soup

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.279
is superb.

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:46.519
Try some.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.159
Try it.

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:56.759
How is it?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.639
Here,

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:03.039
eat some.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.080
Come on,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.080
have a taste.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.120
I-I need to take this call.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.240
Hello.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.720
Who is this?

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:44.480
Now?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.480
It's almost dark.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.559
I am supposed to treat you

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.799
at a nice restaurant.

00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:57.799
Didn't expect I got off work this late.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.080
This place's good.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.039
Let's just make do.

00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:02.720
When you're on the job,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.960
it doesn't matter.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.399
Thanks.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.799
Once the case is over,

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:07.360
treat me to a nice meal.

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:08.759
Let's enjoy then.

00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:09.759
Sure.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.639
When

00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:14.840
your brother and I were in college,

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:16.799
we would sneak out

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:17.399
to drink.

00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:18.519
That was fun.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:19.960
Really?

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.840
My brother never drinks with me.

00:11:25.159 --> 00:11:26.120
Alright. Let's talk

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:26.879
about the case.

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:31.000
I found some suspicions.

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:32.159
Tell me.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.960
Zeng Jie could've chosen

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.159
to kill her by the riverside

00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:37.039
or on a cliff.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.320
Bai Xiaoling is in a wheelchair anyway.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.000
He could kill her

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:41.600
in such spots.

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:43.039
It'd be hard to find out.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.840
For us,

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:44.759
it'd also be hard

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:46.399
to tell if it's an accident or a murder.

00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:49.000
Bai Xiaoling said

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.159
that on the first day,

00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:51.279
Zeng Jie took her

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:52.399
to tourist spots,

00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:53.480
with many tourists.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.519
So he had no chance to act.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.519
And look,

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:58.559
Yang Zhenghui

00:11:58.759 --> 00:11:59.759
practically photographed

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.000
all their movements.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.639
From the photos he provided,

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:04.399
there were a lot of tourists.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.919
Even if

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.679
it were me,

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:09.279
I couldn't find a chance to act too.

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:10.159
Exactly.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.960
But Zeng Jie could've chosen

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.559
to go to a secluded place

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.559
to act on the second or third day.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.200
He had better options.

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:18.799
Why was he so eager

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.639
to kill her

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:20.799
in the hotel that very night?

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.159
So you mean,

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.120
from Zeng Jie's premeditated murder

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:29.720
to an impromptu murder,

00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:30.960
there's a motive

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.960
missing, right?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.679
It's the biggest suspicion.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.120
I agree.

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:42.039
Second,

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:44.360
Zeng Jie's autopsy report shows

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:46.519
he got stabbed three times.

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:49.559
One in the left kidney,
one in the liver,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:50.879
and one in the lung.

00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:55.279
(That's too precise.)

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:56.320
Even if you tell me

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.320
where to stab,

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.399
I couldn't be so precise.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.279
Precisely because of it.

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.440
I think it's more like a coincidence.

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:04.399
Think about it.

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:06.240
Bai Xiaoling didn't learn

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.200
Western medicine,

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:09.120
and she's not a professional.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.200
How could she stab so precisely?

00:13:11.799 --> 00:13:12.399
Exactly.

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:14.080
It needs quite a strength.

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:15.080
A normal person

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.159
couldn't have such strength

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:16.879
to stab so deeply.

00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:19.080
A normal person could do it

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:22.120
in an emotional outburst...

00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:24.840
But she isn't.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.360
She's a disabled woman,

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:27.679
after all.

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:28.200
How could she

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.039
have such strength?

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.200
Let's deduct

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.080
based on your logic,

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:33.679
maybe

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.240
someone helped Bai Xiaoling
commit the crime.

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:42.679
From the scene investigation
and surveillance,

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:43.919
there was no one else.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.360
And, on the weapon,

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:47.960
only Zeng Jie and Bai Xiaoling's

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.919
fingerprints were found.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.840
I think there's no one else,

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.720
and people can exert

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.960
incredible strength

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.440
in critical moments.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.080
But all of this

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.039
is too coincidental.

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:01.759
Let's deduct like this,

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.519
if Bai Xiaoling didn't kill Zeng Jie

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.919
out of self-defense,

00:14:05.919 --> 00:14:07.200
but out of intention.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.200
Why didn't she poison him

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.000
at home?

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.039
She's a fragile woman.

00:14:14.919 --> 00:14:15.960
Taking a knife herself

00:14:16.039 --> 00:14:17.120
and fighting Zeng Jie

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:18.879
is too risky

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.399
and reckless.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.559
Think about it.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.919
When we determine a case,

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:25.799
we must find out

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.960
the suspect's motive.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.799
And what's the more crucial point?

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:30.919
The potential gains.

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:32.480
Who gains the most

00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:34.000
from Bai Xiaoling's death?

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:35.559
Undoubtedly Zeng Jie.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.879
Once she dies,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.279
all her money would go to him.

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:40.000
All her houses and cars

00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:42.320
were under Bai Xiaoling's

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:43.399
name alone.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.879
On the other hand,

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.279
if Zeng Jie died, what would she gain?

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.960
The houses, cars and money

00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:50.480
were already hers.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.879
Only one motive.

00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:54.679
Zeng Jie cheated on her.

00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:57.080
But she had no reason

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.480
to take the risk

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.960
to fight him over this

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.639
and sacrifice with him.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.960
When we interrogated her,

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.279
all the records

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.399
and physical evidence

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.759
all indicate self-defense.

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:08.960
Yet what's

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.720
her attitude?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.200
She didn't

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.120
even defend herself.

00:15:12.919 --> 00:15:14.440
Judging by her behaviors,

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:16.360
it's unlikely to be intentional.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.559
But I just feel

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.000
something's off.

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:23.879
It's good to be suspicious.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.799
Then keep investigating.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.159
But,

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.519
there are many parts

00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:29.360
that are quite clear.

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:31.320
Let's not complicate this further.

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:32.320
Well,

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:33.799
Bai Xiaoling's lawyer,

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:34.600
Zhang...

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.279
Zhang Ye.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:35.919
Zhang Ye.

00:15:36.159 --> 00:15:37.399
I really can't stand him.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.879
But what he said

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.559
makes some sense.

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:42.000
Fair enough,

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.000
right?

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.519
Yes.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.240
Bai Xiaoling

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:52.039
is truly

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.000
a pathetic woman.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.559
After this,

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:55.639
I guess she'll need

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:56.840
to see a therapist

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:57.840
for a long while.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.200
Well,

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.799
I tend to believe
it's excessive self-defense.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.720
Don't overthink.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.840
If you're really

00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:09.720
suspicious about it,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.639
let's interrogate her again.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.320
Investigate everything

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:14.759
Zhang Ye said thoroughly,

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.159
then interrogate her again,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.559
and see

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.559
what she says.

00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:21.000
Yes, definitely.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.480
Hello.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.519
What?

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:33.320
Who?

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:35.840
Why did he turn himself in?

00:16:36.864 --> 00:16:37.279
(Zhang Xiaohong)

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:38.519
(Big Hui, something happened.)

00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:41.279
(Lin Shan left me a note,
saying he'd turn himself in.)

00:16:43.039 --> 00:16:44.200
Over these years,

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.919
I often thought about Fang.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.399
This morning, I saw her again.

00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:53.919
She was sitting

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.440
next to the table we ate.

00:16:56.919 --> 00:16:58.039
She said to me,

00:16:58.879 --> 00:16:59.600
"Shan,

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:01.639
let's eat."

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.119
"Shan, let's eat."

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.559
My mom and dad died early,

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.880
so Fang and I depended on each other.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.839
We were each other's closest kin.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.319
I can't let Fang

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:17.720
die mysteriously.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.079
I can feel your concern

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:20.759
for your sister.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200
Only after four years,

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.440
you've finally come to us.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.680
Exactly.

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:27.640
Back then, I indeed
suspected Zeng Jie too.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.759
But Fang really loved

00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:31.839
Zeng Jie.

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:33.400
So deep down in my heart,

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.319
I considered Zeng Jie
as my brother-in-law

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.839
and didn't suspect him anymore.

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:41.160
But in these four years,

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.599
the more I thought about it,

00:17:43.599 --> 00:17:45.029
the more I felt something's off.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.359
Every time Zeng Jie came to me,

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.839
he would give me money.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.519
If he wasn't guilty,

00:17:51.079 --> 00:17:52.559
why would he give me money?

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:54.920
However,

00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:56.680
I was in need of money.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.079
So, over the years, I kept his secret.

00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:00.279
For these four years,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.839
I bet you took
quite a lot from Zeng Jie.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.200
Yes,

00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:06.400
and no.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.799
He gave it to me.

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:09.680
I didn't ask for it.

00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:11.400
I swear.

00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:13.000
The day Fang died,

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:15.480
Zeng Jie brought money
to me and told me,

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.599
I'd supported Fang for so long.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.160
Now that she was gone,

00:18:19.279 --> 00:18:20.680
no one would support me.

00:18:21.359 --> 00:18:23.720
So he said the money
was a gift in gratitude.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.160
You know what?

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:27.200
When Fang married him,

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:28.599
we didn't get a single penny.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.319
I swear.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.880
You have no idea

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.000
how adorable Fang was,

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:34.559
just like a celebrity.

00:18:35.319 --> 00:18:35.920
I swear.

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:37.599
We didn't get a single penny.

00:18:39.599 --> 00:18:40.599
Zeng Jie gave you money?

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.799
Of course.

00:18:43.799 --> 00:18:44.200
Shan.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:44.960
I'll kill you!

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.519
Shan, it was truly an accident.

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:47.359
Fang.

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:49.079
Things

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:50.599
are different now.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.279
Look,

00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:52.160
my work

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:53.279
has already won awards.

00:18:53.319 --> 00:18:54.279
I'll earn big money.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.400
I'll take care of you.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.799
I'll take care of you.

00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:58.119
Get lost!

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.559
You take care of me?

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:05.920
Fang gave all her savings to you.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.720
You take care of me?

00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:10.079
Shan, trust me.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:10.960
Trust me.

00:19:11.279 --> 00:19:12.720
Look, look,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.119
things are different now.

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.720
I've secured my job now,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.200
and my works have won awards.

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:18.359
I could earn

00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:19.400
a big money soon.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Then what made you decide

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.920
to accuse

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.839
Zeng Jie today?

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:28.759
What?

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:29.759
Why do you ask?

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.440
He's your brother-in-law.

00:19:32.032 --> 00:19:33.120
My foot!

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.160
No offense.

00:19:36.359 --> 00:19:37.359
I mean,

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.799
after he abandoned Fang

00:19:38.839 --> 00:19:40.519
and married a rich woman,

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.839
he has nothing

00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:43.319
to do with me at all.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.839
If you're telling the truth,

00:19:45.079 --> 00:19:46.960
it's Zeng Jie who killed Lin Fang.

00:19:47.799 --> 00:19:49.319
If we arrest Zeng Jie,

00:19:49.319 --> 00:19:50.559
you'll get no money then.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.680
What money?

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.799
That's the money he owed me.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.240
Consider it as the dowry to marry Fang.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.799
Do you think
I care about his little money?

00:20:05.799 --> 00:20:06.680
Officer.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.559
Can I have a cigarette?

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.039
I don't smoke.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.599
Some water will do too.

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:15.640
Water, water.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.559
It happened

00:20:26.839 --> 00:20:27.960
four years ago.

00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:30.319
You even handled

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:31.119
Lin Fang's

00:20:31.119 --> 00:20:31.920
death certificate.

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:34.559
Now you turn yourself in
for murder cover-up.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.119
But we only have your testimony.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.144
Where's Lin Fang's body?

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:39.759
Any forensic report?

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.279
That's why I decided

00:20:44.319 --> 00:20:45.599
to turn myself in.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.319
Zeng Jie

00:20:47.319 --> 00:20:48.720
buried Fang.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.599
Where is Fang now?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.119
Bring her back to me.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.319
I forgot, Shan.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.640
You abandoned her

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.039
in the mountains?

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.440
I buried her.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.640
Shan, I buried her.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.079
How could I bear

00:21:03.319 --> 00:21:04.480
to leave her out there?

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.000
Shan.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
I buried her. I did.

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:14.119
Where then?

00:21:15.839 --> 00:21:16.559
I don't know.

00:21:28.319 --> 00:21:29.359
You don't even know where

00:21:29.359 --> 00:21:29.920
he buried her,

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.079
but you believed your sister

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.319
died of a sudden

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.279
heart attack?

00:21:34.519 --> 00:21:35.880
That's what he said.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.960
Zeng Jie acted

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.039
so convincingly,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.440
so I believed him.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.200
Later, I found out

00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:46.000
Zeng Jie married

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.920
a rich woman.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.319
And I started to suspect

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.039
if Fang became an obstacle

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.839
in his way to wealth.

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:54.599
I've been thinking about it
all these years.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.960
But just like you said,

00:21:56.079 --> 00:21:57.279
I have no evidence.

00:21:57.279 --> 00:21:58.279
Without evidence,

00:21:58.279 --> 00:21:59.200
what can I do?

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.160
What do I do

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.880
to make you believe me?

00:22:04.599 --> 00:22:05.920
But this morning...

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.119
This morning,

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.319
after Fang asked me to eat,

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.000
she said,

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:16.400
"Shan,

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.279
I can't just die like that.

00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:21.200
You have to seek justice for me."

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.160
After hearing this,

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.160
I sat in the yard,

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.160
and kept thinking

00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:30.759
if I should come

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.319
until it got dark.

00:22:34.039 --> 00:22:35.559
Only then, I decided to come.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.440
Why did you come here?

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.319
Why not go to the police station

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:41.440
in your village or in town?

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:44.079
Tell me.

00:22:45.839 --> 00:22:47.799
Zeng Jie is in Caorong.

00:22:48.079 --> 00:22:49.759
You can catch him easily here.

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:52.160
Do you know

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.200
where Zeng Jie buried

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:55.640
Lin Fang's body?

00:22:56.519 --> 00:22:57.839
I don't know the exact spot.

00:22:57.839 --> 00:22:59.960
But the company
where Zeng Jie rented a car

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:01.400
should have records.

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:09.720
The story is quite well put.

00:23:12.039 --> 00:23:13.680
(Zhang Xiaohong just sent me a message,)

00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:15.640
saying Lin Shan turned himself in.

00:23:16.599 --> 00:23:17.559
Isn't it strange?

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.599
It is.

00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:21.079
After Zeng Jie just died,

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.759
Lin Shan came to report Lin Fang's case.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.279
How did he know about it?

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.480
Exactly.

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:27.000
How did he know?

00:23:28.279 --> 00:23:30.039
What? You suspect me?

00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:31.440
Who else then?

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.599
In this case,

00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:33.799
only you and Zeng Jie

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.880
know about Lin Shan.

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:36.288
If it's not you, then Zeng Jie?

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.319
He's dead.

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:39.079
Don't talk like that.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.160
Cut the crap.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.599
Just tell me if you had the motive.

00:23:41.599 --> 00:23:42.119
I...

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.640
Of course, I had.

00:23:46.599 --> 00:23:47.519
Officer Li,

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.160
before they went to travel,

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.200
I've warned you

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:50.839
many times

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.880
that something'd happen.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.359
Right,

00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:53.519
Zeng Jie got killed.

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:54.279
I know.

00:23:54.319 --> 00:23:55.599
If he hadn't attempted to...

00:23:58.799 --> 00:23:59.799
Would he be killed then?

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.920
Do you really think he's killed

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.799
by her self-defense?

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:03.559
The truth

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:04.480
is right there.

00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:05.559
It's not the truth

00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:06.279
but a facade.

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:07.480
Big Hui, what's wrong?

00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:08.960
Did Bai Xiaoling brainwash you?

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:10.119
Exactly.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.720
You've been

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.960
investigating Zeng Jie.

00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:14.912
Regarding what Zeng Jie had done,
including Lin Fang's case,

00:24:15.119 --> 00:24:15.880
your judgment,

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:17.160
investigation and deduction

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.519
are completely sound.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.640
But now Zeng Jie's death

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.720
is suspicious.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.960
Why are you ignoring them?

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.599
I'm not.

00:24:24.599 --> 00:24:25.799
I'm a logical guy.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.000
Logic can have loopholes too.

00:24:30.839 --> 00:24:31.359
Li De,

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.559
before this case happened,

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.480
we both knew well

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:35.519
that Zeng Jie is a creep

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:36.839
and Bai Xiaoling is a victim.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.799
Why are you

00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:39.000
suddenly wavering now?

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.119
Zeng Jie took Bai on a trip.

00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:42.359
We know what he wanted to do.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.799
This logic

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:45.200
is enough to support the truth.

00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:46.000
First,

00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:47.160
I need evidence.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.279
In this case,

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.240
evidence and motive are crucial.

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:51.279
Second,

00:24:51.799 --> 00:24:53.480
I hope Bai Xiaoling
acted in self-defense.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:54.839
Because I know,

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:55.799
Zeng Jie wasn't

00:24:55.799 --> 00:24:56.839
a decent person.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.519
But it doesn't mean

00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.839
he can die without clarity.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.119
At last,

00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:02.599
I'm a cop.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.480
You want logic,

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.119
but I want justice.

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:26.200
No drinking during an investigation.

00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:27.880
You're being difficult.

00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:37.240
Well,

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.839
can you share with me?

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.799
What will you and Zhang Ye discuss with

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.400
Bai Xiaoling tomorrow?

00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:45.279
What else?

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.920
Just try to calm her down.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.720
This case is

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.759
basically settled.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.200
It's definitely self-defense.

00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:52.640
The point now is

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.000
whether it's excessive or not.

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:55.960
Let me tell you.

00:25:56.279 --> 00:25:56.960
I will

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.200
keep investigating this case

00:25:58.519 --> 00:25:59.240
and clear up

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:00.000
all the doubts.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:00.920
Okay.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.160
You're meticulous,

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:03.240
upright and righteous.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.200
Go ahead then.

00:26:07.039 --> 00:26:08.240
By the way,

00:26:08.839 --> 00:26:10.079
Bai Xiaoling is not in

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.720
good physical or mental health.

00:26:12.319 --> 00:26:13.359
Of course.

00:26:15.559 --> 00:26:16.279
Yes.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:17.720
Anyone

00:26:17.839 --> 00:26:18.559
would break down

00:26:18.759 --> 00:26:19.880
and have a negative mindset

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.680
in her position.

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:23.119
I'm worried if her health

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:24.279
would be

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.839
getting worse.

00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:29.920
She should be fine.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.119
She's quite strong.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.320
Just clear it all up.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.279
Calm down.

00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:41.279
No drinking on the job.

00:26:42.839 --> 00:26:43.400
Calm down.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.640
(Kept by a rich lady, Master Z)

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.400
(Zeng Jie?)

00:26:54.839 --> 00:26:55.599
(So who is this Master Z?)
(Zeng Jie?)

00:26:56.119 --> 00:26:56.880
(Have you heard?)

00:26:57.039 --> 00:26:58.200
(He was a professor.)

00:26:58.519 --> 00:26:59.839
(The master was kept by a rich lady)
(He was a kept man?)

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:00.960
(The rich lady treated his illness)
(Oh my!)

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:02.319
(Recently, a female student...)
(He even had flings with his students.)

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.519
(Pottery Master Z)
(What a hypocrite.)

00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:04.920
(Is he from your school?)

00:27:05.376 --> 00:27:05.839
(A huge scandal)

00:27:05.839 --> 00:27:07.079
(He even abused his wife.)

00:27:08.079 --> 00:27:08.720
(I heard)

00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:10.240
(he even killed his ex.)

00:27:11.079 --> 00:27:12.519
(He cheated all the time.)

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.480
(The master was a cheater)
(What a rat.)

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.079
(Was he stabbed to death?)

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.440
(That's so scary.)

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.240
As expected,

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.799
this stirred up a discussion online.

00:27:20.119 --> 00:27:21.359
The video creators,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.200
public accounts,

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.000
and bloggers

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
are all sharing this.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.480
The information

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:26.519
spread so fast now.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.160
Maybe this is a good thing.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:34.480
Hello.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640
Thank you, Tracy.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.039
Thank me?

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.039
Thank you for convincing Lin Shan.

00:27:39.319 --> 00:27:39.960
I didn't expect

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.160
you'd help me.

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:43.839
Lin Shan?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.079
What's it to do with me?

00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:47.559
He turned himself in yesterday.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.480
You didn't know it?

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:51.920
That is impossible.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.279
I never talk to him

00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:54.240
about Zeng Jie and Fang.

00:27:55.559 --> 00:27:56.839
No way.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.079
But he turned himself in yesterday.

00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:01.160
You did nothing?

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.079
I want to ask you the same thing.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.559
How is that possible?

00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:10.200
Bai Xiaoling,

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:11.960
I have a few questions

00:28:12.079 --> 00:28:13.359
that need your answers.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.599
Ask away.

00:28:15.799 --> 00:28:16.720
In November last year,

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:18.039
at Zeng Jie's studio,

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.359
there was a fire incident.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.519
And you were there.

00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:21.799
Could you tell us

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:22.799
the details about it?

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.000
It was an accident.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.440
The fire department

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.079
had investigated everything clearly.

00:28:30.079 --> 00:28:31.039
(The charcoal ignited)

00:28:31.079 --> 00:28:32.200
(the blanket on the sofa.)

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.839
(There was no one on that floor,)

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.480
(so the fire spread)

00:28:37.079 --> 00:28:38.680
(and burned down the whole studio.)

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:42.559
When did you leave?

00:28:43.599 --> 00:28:45.359
I don't remember the exact time.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.039
Probably

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.000
an hour before the fire.

00:28:50.079 --> 00:28:51.240
Before the fire,

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.599
did you tell Zeng Jie

00:28:52.759 --> 00:28:54.000
and his colleagues

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.000
that you

00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:56.160
wanted to rest?

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:56.839
Yes.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.799
Did Zeng Jie think

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.039
you're on the third floor

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.240
of the studio at that time?

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.240
I went home.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.079
I rushed over
after I heard about the fire.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.400
A month after the fire,

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.119
you had a car accident.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.000
Do you remember the details?

00:29:23.559 --> 00:29:24.200
Yes.

00:29:25.559 --> 00:29:27.160
I went to meet a master in the suburbs

00:29:27.839 --> 00:29:29.799
to pray for my sick father.

00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:31.599
On the way...

00:29:33.856 --> 00:29:35.733
(Little Fairy, Answer)

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.680
Why did you drive there alone?

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.039
Where is your husband?

00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:40.359
He's so busy.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.039
I finally found a master to pray

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.160
for my father.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.480
I can't wait

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.680
for my husband to finish work.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.079
When I'm back,

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.920
we'll go for a massage.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:49.839
Okay, okay.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.440
Why isn't the brake working?

00:29:56.599 --> 00:29:57.359
Impossible.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.759
Did you press the wrong pedal?

00:29:59.200 --> 00:29:59.920
Impossible.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.880
It's really not working.

00:30:03.519 --> 00:30:04.079
Don't panic.

00:30:04.079 --> 00:30:05.559
I'll find someone to ask right now.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.000
What to do?

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:09.319
I'm going too fast.

00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:10.799
How do I stop the car?

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.000
Before the accident,

00:30:18.599 --> 00:30:20.119
Zeng Jie took that car

00:30:20.119 --> 00:30:21.400
for maintenance, right?

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.480
Yes.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.720
Bai Xiaoling,

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.000
regarding the fire at Zeng Jie's studio

00:30:27.119 --> 00:30:28.160
and the car accident

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.960
that disabled you,

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.880
have you ever thought

00:30:30.359 --> 00:30:31.480
about the connection

00:30:32.119 --> 00:30:33.359
between them?

00:30:42.119 --> 00:30:43.079
Answer us.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.720
Do you think it might be...

00:30:45.839 --> 00:30:47.200
Zeng Jie

00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:49.079
attempted to kill me?

00:30:49.839 --> 00:30:50.640
Right?

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.640
To be honest,

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:55.480
in the past year,

00:30:56.079 --> 00:30:57.680
I've never thought about it this way.

00:30:58.039 --> 00:30:59.160
And I never wanted to

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.160
think about it this way.

00:31:07.119 --> 00:31:08.599
That's my husband.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.279
(The man I chose)

00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:12.039
(to spend my life with.)

00:31:14.279 --> 00:31:15.319
(When we started dating,)

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.519
(everyone told me)

00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:18.680
(not to choose him.)

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:20.759
(He was from humble origin)

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:21.720
(and didn't deserve me.)

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.359
(He was just a teacher)

00:31:23.359 --> 00:31:24.960
(with a meager income,)

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:27.000
(a ceramic artist)

00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:28.128
(who couldn't earn much.)

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.920
Yet I just

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.079
chose him.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.240
I used my family's money

00:31:33.319 --> 00:31:34.640
to make a studio for him,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.640
so his talent could shine.

00:31:37.559 --> 00:31:39.039
I spared no effort to support him

00:31:39.119 --> 00:31:40.400
in various competitions,

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.960
so he could stand out.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.559
When others called him

00:31:45.599 --> 00:31:46.839
Master Zeng,

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.240
I was so proud.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.200
Everything I did

00:31:56.079 --> 00:31:57.960
was out of love.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.319
I wanted to give him everything.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.960
I knew he had affairs.

00:32:11.759 --> 00:32:12.880
I comforted myself

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.279
that as long as

00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:15.519
he stayed with me,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.400
I'd pretend not to know.

00:32:18.359 --> 00:32:19.200
Later,

00:32:20.079 --> 00:32:21.559
our problems grew.

00:32:23.039 --> 00:32:24.680
Last year, I considered divorce.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.279
But I trusted him,

00:32:29.079 --> 00:32:30.119
so I never did any

00:32:30.119 --> 00:32:31.480
prenuptial agreement.

00:32:32.119 --> 00:32:32.880
So I didn't want

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.160
to divorce like that.

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:35.680
I even thought about

00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:37.720
catching him cheating on me

00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:39.119
to win the lawsuit.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:46.880
Have some water.

00:33:00.759 --> 00:33:01.319
Yes,

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.680
I've been seriously

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.279
thinking about what happened before.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.920
The night the studio caught fire,

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.079
Zeng Jie must've

00:33:09.119 --> 00:33:10.039
thought I went to rest

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.359
on the third floor.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.839
He sent his friends off.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.319
During the fire,

00:33:15.319 --> 00:33:16.640
he wasn't on the second floor.

00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:18.599
He was at the kiln.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.519
When he noticed the fire

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:22.079
and went upstairs to find me,

00:33:22.839 --> 00:33:24.279
if I were really on the third floor,

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.400
I might've been burned to death.

00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:29.720
When I went to the scene,

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.319
I felt fortunate when I saw

00:33:31.319 --> 00:33:32.400
him wearing a mask

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.000
and wrapped in a fire blanket.

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:36.920
Now, what do you expect me to say?

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.319
Why did anyone

00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:40.079
prepare with these things in advance?

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.559
Regarding the car accident,

00:33:44.839 --> 00:33:46.839
before I drove, only Zeng Jie

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.559
took my car for maintenance.

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:49.839
I'm not sure

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.119
if the car was tampered with.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.680
But I am sure

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.799
that I wouldn't press

00:33:55.039 --> 00:33:56.480
the wrong pedal.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.000
I have raced in rallies.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.640
Yes,

00:34:03.599 --> 00:34:05.200
Zeng Jie has always wanted me dead.

00:34:06.039 --> 00:34:07.200
For this trip,

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.199
he wanted me to completely

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.719
disappear from his life.

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:13.119
Compared to a divorce,

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.239
he would benefit even more if I die.

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:17.719
He could own all my money.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.840
He was really

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.039
ruthless towards me.

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:38.159
We know everything

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:38.880
you mentioned.

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:40.800
It depends on how the court

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.639
defines it.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:43.599
As for whether it's excessive,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.039
further analysis is needed.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.400
However,

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:48.840
if Zeng Jie

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.920
attempted to kill you,

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:51.119
during your trip,

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:52.320
it'd be easier

00:34:52.559 --> 00:34:54.159
for Zeng Jie to act by the cliff

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.199
or by the river.

00:34:55.559 --> 00:34:56.320
After it,

00:34:56.559 --> 00:34:57.800
he could still

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.039
fake it like an accident.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.320
But why did

00:35:00.519 --> 00:35:01.280
he choose to act

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.199
in the room?

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.960
If he did

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.079
pull it off,

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:07.719
it's hard to escape the investigation.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.199
Was he that stupid?

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:18.559
I confronted him that night,

00:35:18.719 --> 00:35:20.079
thinking to get a divorce.

00:35:20.719 --> 00:35:21.760
So I told him

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.199
every secret I knew

00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:24.280
about him.

00:35:24.599 --> 00:35:25.320
As a result,

00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:27.159
he went into a rage

00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:29.679
and lost control.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.880
You probably don't know.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.280
Zeng Jie lost control easily.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.840
He had always been violent.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.159
Before my car accident,

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.840
he had abused me many times.

00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:43.559
He also did it

00:35:45.039 --> 00:35:46.199
after the car accident.

00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:50.079
Why didn't you ever call the police?

00:35:51.719 --> 00:35:52.800
I wanted to save face then.

00:35:53.719 --> 00:35:55.079
You wanted to save face then.

00:35:55.519 --> 00:35:57.079
Now that Zeng Jie is dead,

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.559
and you're saying he abused you.

00:36:00.519 --> 00:36:02.039
Okay. Say it's true,

00:36:02.079 --> 00:36:02.800
we investigate.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.679
But now,

00:36:03.679 --> 00:36:04.880
it's so difficult for us

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.840
to collect evidence.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.480
I

00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:12.519
have evidence.

00:36:22.464 --> 00:36:28.448
(October 21, 2018)

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:46.519
(I will definitely do)

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.119
(what I promised.)

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.119
(A day before Lin Shan turned himself in)
I am trustworthy.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.360
Okay.

00:36:53.519 --> 00:36:54.519
Okay.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.440
When will you pay me

00:36:59.519 --> 00:37:00.920
the remaining payment?

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.000
Just tell the police

00:37:03.039 --> 00:37:04.960
about Lin Fang and the clues.

00:37:05.199 --> 00:37:05.960
After then,

00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:07.360
I will contact you.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.160
Good!

00:37:29.696 --> 00:37:31.392
Good!

00:37:35.264 --> 00:37:36.416
Good!

00:37:38.304 --> 00:37:42.048
If the police ask you about Lin Fang,

00:37:42.048 --> 00:37:43.808
just tell them the truth.

00:37:45.632 --> 00:37:46.812
Who?

00:37:48.384 --> 00:37:49.248
I'm not done yet.

00:37:50.368 --> 00:37:50.848
Sorry.

00:37:51.808 --> 00:37:53.248
I know you've got taste.

00:37:53.248 --> 00:37:54.336
It's indeed different.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.992
It was Guatemalan-washed

00:37:58.272 --> 00:37:59.174
Oh my!

00:38:04.416 --> 00:38:06.432
Officer,

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.616

Bai Xiaoling, listen.

If you want to die,

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.296
let's go die together.

You need to dig deep into Zeng Jie.

00:39:02.144 --> 00:39:05.472
I think it's very likely
that he was not a first-time killer,

00:39:06.048 --> 00:39:08.832

I went to rest on the third floor.

He sent his friends off.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.104
During the fire,
he wasn't on the second floor.

00:39:31.232 --> 00:39:32.864
He was at the kiln.

00:39:33.984 --> 00:39:35.648
My husband brought it specially.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.440

My husband brought it specifically,

saying it's more hygienic.
