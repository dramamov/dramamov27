for this role other than you.

Congratulations.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.260
Yes.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.290
You passed the audition.
Why do you look so unexcited?

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.810
I'm sorry.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.280
Why? Did you break up?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.450
Really?

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.040
What kind of person are they?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.770
He's not human.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.270
He's a goblin. My first love.

that you were completely immersed

in your passionate love with a goblin
even before the shooting,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.940

Thank you, everyone, for your support.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.590
Your sincere love confession
touched everyone.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.250
How did your real first love end?

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.360
Hmm... Not yet.

you did another job.

It's been a year,
yet you still don't remember my name.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.610
This is my born attitude.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.300
It's an old habit.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.410
That's why I value you,
Superstar Ha, so much.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.010
Because you're the only one
who's stuck to your contract with me.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.130
What about the thing I asked you to do?

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.310
The pawnshop?

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.850
It doesn't exist.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.260
I searched all over Seoul but couldn't
find a pawnshop with that name.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.720
Please help me keep looking for it.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.620
Of course.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.510
That's our contract condition, after all.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.650
Oh, Mr. Nishimura.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.520
It's been a long time!

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:20.529
Would he show up if I saw a ghost?

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.220
Keumbok!

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.430
He's at the very top

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.380
when it comes to cash in this country.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.710
But why would a big shot like this
invest in a company with only one artist?

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.190
I heard he's a fan of yours,
Keumbyul.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.590
Oh, really?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.500
How do I look?

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.400
Awesome.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.750

looks better today.

Let's change seats.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.110
Why change seats?

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.370
Let's change.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.700
So he can see this side of my face.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.390
They have to see me like this

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.060
so we can get the investment.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.750
It's the same. How is it different?

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.500

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.970

Where did you get this—

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.490
I want to know if you mean

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.460
what you said in your interview.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.320
That your first love was a goblin.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.210
That's because he's immersed
in his character—

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:33.480
Sir?

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.260
I'll get going.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.050
You two have a good chat.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.770
Sir, I...

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.210
I'll go with you.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.840
Let him go.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.540
I'll take him home safely.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.130
Who are you?

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.830
The pawnshop owner you're looking for.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.570
I can't trust you either, then.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.020
You sent a ghost to kill me.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.020
I don't normally kill humans.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.930
As long as they have nothing
to do with us.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.620
If you want to get involved,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.510
you can follow him.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.060
Why did you come to me?

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.350
You should have forgotten everything,

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.450
but you talked about goblins.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.200
Not only did you dispel the evil spirits
without leaving a trace,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.720
and your energy is quite intact.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.140
You still remember it, too.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.320
This is a first.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.190
Where is he?

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.210
Do you want to see him?

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.760
I have to see him.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.370
Why?

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.910
Your life is already perfect, right?

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.870
You starred in the movie you wanted to.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.880
You're doing well as an actor, too.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.260
If you get involved with non-humans,
it will be difficult.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.180
Why don't you sign the contract again?

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.720
I promise I won't make a mistake this time

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.920
and I'll wipe it all clean.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.600
You must have been

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.870
single all your life.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.010
You don't seem to understand.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.350
Sometimes, rather than being alone,
it's better to suffer together.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.820
Especially when you're in love.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.860
Ha Keumbok.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.679
It's been hard for me,
even though it was just a year.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.150
But he waited for a thousand years.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.050
How could he forget?

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.990

How did you change so much in a year?

I saw you on TV.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:28.700
I was thinking about you.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.240
I'm so happy to see you.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.110
Me too.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.430
I was just passing by, so I decided
to drop by since it's been a while.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.610
I have a lot of memories here.

Right?

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.290
You always broke dishes
and forgot customers' orders,

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.570
making mistakes everywhere.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.500
Ma'am,
when did I forget customer orders?

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.870
But it was a nice time, too.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.020
You worked hard no matter what you did.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.950
I also watched your interview.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:55.080
You did?

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.690
What a twist.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.170
I thought you were an innocent kid.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.550
The love confession was so passionate.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.580
How did your real first love end?

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.070
Hmm... Not yet.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.190
I'm already getting envious of the person

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.480
who'd be your first love.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.990
No, I mean it hasn't ended.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.900
I still like him.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.140
The goblin.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.440
Oh?

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.090
I didn't expect you to be so into it.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.590
My goblin is special.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.740
He can't distinguish salt from sugar,
yet is picky when it comes to food.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.980
You can keep this for yourself.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.710
Is it good?

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.640
He would grumble, but he'd still
bring an umbrella for me on rainy days.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.490
Huh?

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.950
Why is this here?

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.050
If I say I'm scared, he'll be with me.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.280
Are you a kid?

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.590
Why are you afraid?

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.770
I'm sorry.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.930
Well...

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.940
It's safe in the neighborhood at night.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.380
Just letting you know.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.330
Ha Keumbok!

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.580
Are you okay?

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.720
How can I forget?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.230

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.860
I'm so touched!

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.350
I didn't put that up.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.200
Huh? Who did, then?

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.820
It was left by a regular customer.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.980
He said he's your number one fan.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.410
Done.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.510
Oh, he's here!

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.590
Gosh.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.250
This timing is fate.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.550
That's right.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.370
It's fate.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.990
Nothing has changed here.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.060
So? You don't like it?

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.510
I'm just happy.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.450
But I heard someone else lived there.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.300
How can there be no changes?

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.010
Because no one else lived there.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.530
That's not right, though.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.040
When I came here,

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.000
the person said
this place was up for sale.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.810
I was going to sell it,

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.800
but I didn't in the end.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.320
Why?

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.960
Is it because of me?

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.850
The house price dropped too much.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.180
Aside from not earning anything,
I'd have taken a huge loss.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.740
Of course.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.050
Hurry up.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.100
Okay.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.290
Is it heavy?

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.390
Yes.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.200
My room is over there...

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.350
I didn't want to leave
because I thought you'd come back.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.960
Then why didn't you come to me?

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.590
You seemed to be doing well.
I didn't want to bother you.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.580
You're bothering me more
by not being by my side.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.140
I'm sorry.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.190
Wait.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.250
You've gotten quite bold
since we last met, huh?

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.170
I told you to eat three meals a day,
didn't I?

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.000
Why are you so thin?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.060
I've always been slim—

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.660
The weight you put on your cheeks
is gone, too.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.090
How can I eat without you?

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.590
Nothing tastes good!

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.520
You're not a kid!

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:37.990
Can't you eat well by yourself?

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.090
Yeah!

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.510
I'm just a kid.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.540
What?

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.050
A kid who can't do anything
without Ha Keumpoop.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.250
So you have to take care
of me for the rest of your life.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.010
Why are you saying that? It's scary.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:50.890
What's wrong with that?

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.540
Given our relationship—

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.640
Are you crazy, Mister?

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.360
What "Mister"?

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.120
If I'm "Mister," what are you?
A kid?

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.840
Then what should I call you?

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:07.380
My goblin?

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.280
Hyung?

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.880
How about...

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.150
Honey?

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:19.480
Let's take our time.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.180
We have plenty of time.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.079
Now that you've got me,
you're going to just do the bare minimum?

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.869
I didn't know you were someone like that.
This is too much.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:29.510
Let go of me!

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.980
I've been waiting for you
for a thousand years.
This is how you treat me?

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.220
I'm so sad. Sad!

Call me Hyung.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.320
Go on.

Are you crazy?

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.420
Baby.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.830
Can you call me Hyung?

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.080
We're 1,000 years apart. Hyung?

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.690
Do you have a conscience?

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.720
Please wake up, Mister.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.350
Are you mad, Master?

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.740
What?

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.600
No.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.630
I'm not mad.
I just spoke a little louder.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.430
Are you upset?

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:11.910
Never mind.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.630
How can I expect anything from you?

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.230
You are upset.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.340
Honey.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.710
What?

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.270
Nothing.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:54.140
I just want to say, so this is how
it feels to be full from just love.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.960
Are you serious?

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.360
Hey, what did you eat to become so cute?

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.860
I'm always cute.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.700
That must be it.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.230
Right.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.510
That's why you could be Mr. Cabbage.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.600
I should have given birth to you.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.570
Where did you learn to talk like that?

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.750
On the Internet.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.600
I saw this comment on your news.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.400
As for me...

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.060
the number of days I wait for you
in a week is six days.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.360
Why?

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.410
Because I broke my neck.
[*T/N: "Neck" and "Thursday"
sound similar in Korean.]

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.640
By the way, where's Gildal?

Right now...

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.020
I think he's near Pohang.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.330
What do you mean, "near Pohang"?

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.000
He's on a walk across the country.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.590
He said he'd forget his sadness
by getting tired.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.610
Where's your mom?

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.050
You lost your owner, too?

They'll see to it, right?

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:40.330
They're not the type to give up easily.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.870
Doctor, you're so handsome.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.300
I think it's lost.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.910

Can't you just call Gildal?

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.050
No.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:00.870
