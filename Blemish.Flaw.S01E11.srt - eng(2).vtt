00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.799
(What?)

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.159
(Exactly.)

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:39.640
Ms. Juan

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.040
is actually my client.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:42.560
What kind of client?

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:44.560
I helped her with her divorce

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:46.680
and won her a fortune.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.400
Then,

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:49.560
she hired my law firm

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.280
as her permanent legal advisor.

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.079
We've had a pleasant collaboration
all these years.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.879
This Zeng Jie

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.159
is such a creep.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.239
In this case,

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:03.959
Ms. Juan isn't young, is she?

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:04.840
Right.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.000
Wealthy,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.079
competent,

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:08.240
and mature.

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:09.280
Zeng Jie?

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.479
An artist.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.879
He used to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.400
accompany you to Japan.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.080
This painting is his work.

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.319
If it were poorly painted,

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.560
I wouldn't display it.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.560
Zeng Jie's quite talented now.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.800
He's become a master.

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.439
My judgment of people

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.960
is nice.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.560
Of course.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.159
You are really discerning.

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.360
So,

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.639
Zeng Jie

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.520
also received your favors?

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.680
Just say it.

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.599
Why do you ask?

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:54.439
Who is he?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.840
Him?

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:57.439
It's

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.479
a long story.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.759
I'll explain.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:00.400
I'll explain.

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:01.599
Ms. Juan,

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.960
I'll tell you everything,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.400
including the reason

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:05.560
we're here to you.

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:08.879
So,

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.360
you think Zeng Jie is a murderer?

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.680
To be precise,

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.280
this speculation is logically sound.

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:15.599
You're not a cop.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.520
Zeng Jie

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.960
has nothing to do with you.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.199
Why do you investigate him?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.400
This somewhat

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.759
relates to my profession.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.039
Moreover, if Zeng Jie

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.840
commits crimes,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.479
I want

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.800
to stop him.

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.240
What's it to you?

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.000
Well,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.439
just for fun.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.960
Ms. Juan.

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.840
Besides,

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.840
this truly doesn't concern you.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.000
What's it to you?

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.120
He's my brother.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:41.599
His girlfriend

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.479
was snatched by Zeng Jie.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.240
You two have

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.080
different surnames.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.000
Cousin?

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.800
Buddy.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.879
Buddy.

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:51.120
Zeng Jie

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.719
is really something now.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:53.520
Ms. Juan,

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.560
if you don't mind,

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.800
tell us something.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.599
Right.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:59.800
Zeng Jie has deceived

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.719
many girls.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.520
Let me tell you.

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.840
Many of his female students...

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.199
In relationships,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.800
it's either mutual consent

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.800
or transactional exchange.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.719
Who's actually that naive?

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.360
True.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.759
What you mention

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.639
does exist,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.719
but we should

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:15.159
uphold some justice.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.000
Naive.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.319
I can tell

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.800
you're not married yet.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:19.560
Got a girlfriend?

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:20.439
No.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.480
Own a house?

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:21.920
No.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.800
Can't afford it.

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:24.439
Then why bother?

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.160
Stay out of other's business.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.000
Instead of wasting time,

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:29.439
you should focus on your own life.

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:30.920
You're not a child.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.879
Be a man.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.360
I shall never become

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.240
a man.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:35.279
I will remain a child,

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.439
and then suddenly an old man.

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:38.759
Quoted from Kafka?

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.279
Interesting.

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.000
Yes, yes.

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.079
He's cultured.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:44.000
Alright.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.759
Tell me.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.680
What do you both want to know?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.759
(I remember)

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.199
(it was many years ago.)

00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:57.199
(I had a friend)

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.240
(who owned a shop.)

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.319
(I remember)

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.800
(the walls of his shop)

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:04.079
(were covered
with Impressionist paintings.)

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:05.759
(All reproductions,)

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.399
(but I adored them.)

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.199
(That's where)

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:11.399
(I first met Zeng Jie.)

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.839
(I remember)

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.160
(when I saw him)

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.360
(in his studio,)

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.000
(sitting before an easel,)

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.879
(covered in paint,)

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.839
(I found him so charming.)

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:27.959
(I could tell)

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.439
(he is a wolf in sheep's clothing.)

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.600
(But)

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.279
(his poverty)

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:37.279
(was driving him mad.)

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.680
This must be

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.360
the tragedy of life.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.000
You waste time

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.240
during your prime years.

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:45.480
When you get older,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.160
you'd regret it.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.800
So Ms. Juan,

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:50.720
you first met Zeng Jie

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:51.879
at that time?

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.920
Zeng Jie was talented

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.120
and stubborn.

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:55.959
At that time,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.639
I wanted to help him.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.839
Women are often

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.079
sympathetic to the weak.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:01.800
Help him with what?

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:03.160
Help him

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.959
to survive in this world.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.959
This path is too slow.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.439
I want to take a fast path,

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.480
but I don't have one.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.920
Are you seeking a path

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.439
or shortcuts?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.160
Not the same?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.680
Of course not.

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:19.600
Paths

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.360
are for everyone.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.800
But shortcuts

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:25.399
are only for the few.

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:34.720
Who are you?

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.040
He was still
in postgraduate studies then,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.079
also his toughest period,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.279
struggling to make ends meet.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.600
And his dad's hospitalized
for treatment.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.720
Back then,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.319
I thought he had a hard life.

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:57.639
Guess

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.439
I pitied for him.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.680
Ms. Juan.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.399
He's so fortunate

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.800
that he could be

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:06.439
noticed by you.

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:07.920
Ms. Juan,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.360
Zeng Jie had a girlfriend.

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:10.240
You knew it, right?

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.120
The one who became his wife.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.199
Her name was...

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:13.839
Bai Xiaoling?

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:15.560
I think so.

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:18.160
After meeting her,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.199
Zeng Jie even came to me

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.519
for dating advice.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.959
No, that wasn't Bai Xiaoling.

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:23.399
That was the one

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.120
before her,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.519
named Lin Fang,

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:26.600
a rural girl.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:27.720
Well,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.959
I haven't heard of it.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.120
Nor do I care.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.959
Why did you give

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:33.759
Zeng Jie dating advice?

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.519
Zeng Jie is an ambitious man.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.519
I just helped him realize his potential.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.720
I knew

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.839
he'll make his name.

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:44.839
And

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.319
I admire him greatly.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.480
So I gave him a boost.

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:50.480
Ever invested in stocks?

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:51.639
If you pick

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.160
a potential stock,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.639
and watch its value soar,

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:57.199
it'd make you feel so good.

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:00.879
What do you think?

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.920
Just as I thought before.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.959
Zeng Jie can achieve
his status and influence,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.560
must've overcome many hardships.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.759
The road to success has been so arduous,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.680
would he dare commit murder?

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:12.160
That's why he'd

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:13.600
fight to death to defend them.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.279
Makes sense.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.040
But Ms. Juan doesn't know

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.160
about Lin Fang.

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:19.120
Lin Fang wasn't threatening Ms. Juan,

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:20.680
but Bai Xiaoling.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.160
Then who is Bai Xiaoling threatening?

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:23.680
Zeng Jie doesn't live off women now.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.560
Bai Xiaoling

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.639
is threatening Zeng Jie.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.800
So you believe

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.360
Zeng Jie would hurt Bai Xiaoling?

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.759
You just analyzed

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.639
all that earlier.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.360
No, I mean,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.960
you believe it now, right?

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.519
Yes.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:41.320
If you tried to convince Bai Xiaoling

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:41.919
not to travel,

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.840
would she listen?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.720
What?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.840
Listen to me?

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.799
If she ever listened to me,

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:49.440
she would've divorced before the crash.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.960
If she listened to me,

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:51.759
she wouldn't

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:53.120
marry that creep Zeng Jie.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.159
Calm down.

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:55.919
I know it is not easy for you,

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:57.440
as a backup.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.279
What did you say?

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.799
Do I even qualify as a backup?

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:03.919
I'm just her old classmate

00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:05.799
and not even a close one.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.519
Right.

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:07.360
Right.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.440
Seems it's not an option.

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:12.000
Let's investigate then.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.279
What?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.080
Find out where

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.159
her travel destination is.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.639
We could take precautions.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.559
Coming!

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.679
Who is it?

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:46.200
What do you want?

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.519
Did you extort money

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.200
from Zeng Jie?

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.399
A huge sum?

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.200
What?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.120
If there's no proof,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.000
don't slander me.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:53.919
Or, I'll sue you.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.559
Tell me

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.399
how Lin Fang died.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.559
Don't mention Fang.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.000
Or I'll act tough.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.399
Come on.

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:01.039
Show me

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.960
how you act tough.

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:02.639
Come on.

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:10.799
What's wrong?

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:12.720
Don't touch me!

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.679
Don't you dare

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:14.480
extort me.

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:15.759
Let go!

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.279
Listen,

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.519
Fang had heart disease.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.360
So do I.

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:20.519
Cut the act!

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:21.399
I just came

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.480
to ask some questions.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.279
Stop pretending.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.200
Cut the act.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.159
Don't you want

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.799
to know how Fang died?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.519
That's exactly it.

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:29.840
Listen,

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:31.720
leave now, or I'll kill myself.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.120
Don't be shameless here.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.200
If he's shameless,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.159
he won't care about me.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.440
He cares about you,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.000
but he still could be shameless.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.159
Just get to the point.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.039
He'll be here soon.

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:43.720
You just want me to find out

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.159
how Lin Fang really died.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.759
I'm certain

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:48.159
that Lin Shan must know something,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.679
and it's related to Zeng Jie.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.879
You

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.320
went to Lin Shan,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.200
and Lin Shan would've informed Zeng Jie.

00:10:58.679 --> 00:10:59.120
You

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:00.679
had investigated Zeng Jie.

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.759
That would make Zeng Jie nervous.

00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:04.399
Lin Shan seized the chance

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.080
to extort a large sum from Zeng Jie.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.039
That makes perfect sense.

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:08.879
But I think it

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:09.720
isn't that simple.

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:12.080
If Lin Shan truly knew

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.000
Zeng Jie's secrets,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.600
he could've

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:14.440
extorted him

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:15.600
before I stepped in.

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:17.720
Makes sense.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.919
Then this money

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:22.000
wasn't from Zeng Jie?

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:23.960
I can only rely on you now.

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:25.039
Remember,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.279
don't let him suspect you.

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:28.120
Don't worry.

00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:29.519
I've been watching

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.639
many crime-solving videos.

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:31.559
I can handle it.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.360
Enough. Stop eating.

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:34.960
Just leave.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.559
He'll arrive.

00:11:35.639 --> 00:11:36.519
Fine.

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:40.480
I've watched

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.240
all your videos

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:41.960
for many times.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.200
You haven't updated for long.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.519
The Logic Behind Truth.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.879
We all seek the truth.

00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:51.879
Truth always hides deep.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.360
Only by clarifying the logic

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:54.080
can we obtain

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.759
the truth.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.480
(The Logic Behind Truth)
During Zeng Jie's postgraduate studies,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.320
his father fell ill
and was hospitalized.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.799
The tuition,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.799
living expenses,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.919
and medical bills

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:05.840
crushed Zeng Jie

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.080
under financial pressure.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.159
But

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:10.200
he had no way

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:12.039
to earn big money quickly.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.600
When he was at a loss,

00:12:15.039 --> 00:12:16.080
someone

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.440
showed up.

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:20.840
That's Ms. Juan,

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:22.039
around the same age

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.399
as Zeng Jie's dad.

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:24.440
She's wealthy

00:12:24.559 --> 00:12:25.200
and decided

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.200
to offer Zeng Jie financial support.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.840
Hey, can you stop shaking?

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.200
Try holding this.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.159
It's so heavy!

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.480
I'll pay for a tripod, okay?

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.200
Tripods lack human touch.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.320
You're not even filming.

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:41.320
Just say it.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.080
Action.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.919
To obtain Ms. Juan's money,

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:53.440
I bet you can tell

00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:54.519
what the condition was.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.399
We youngsters often

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:57.159
say things like,

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.000
"Madam,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.480
I want to live off you."

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:00.559
as dark humor,

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:02.320
but not everyone

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:03.879
would make up their mind

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.039
to actually do so.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.440
For three years,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.919
Zeng Jie became Ms. Juan's

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.399
an on-call companion.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.480
Beyond Caorong,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.440
they traveled to

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:15.960
many destinations,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.600
including two Japan trips

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:19.320
where he received medical treatment

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.559
for his weak stomach.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.600
Before, he can only eat

00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:23.440
plain foods.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.840
But Ms. Juan found someone

00:13:24.879 --> 00:13:26.440
to completely cure him.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.120
With Ms. Juan's financial support,

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:30.159
Zeng Jie spent

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:32.000
many times his previous costs

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.720
to create a set of artworks

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:35.200
for the competition

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:36.399
and won first prize.

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:39.200
This marked
the beginning of Master Zeng's

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:40.759
road to fame.

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:42.039
But at this moment,

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.080
Ms. Juan was losing her interest

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.919
in Zeng Jie,

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.799
so they ended this relationship

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.200
with a significant age gap.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.559
Zeng Jie knew very well

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:54.720
that he and Ms. Juan
won't end up together.

00:13:54.919 --> 00:13:55.799
That's why he

00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:57.840
maintained his relationship

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:58.960
with Lin Fang.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.480
And they had even held
a rural wedding banquet,

00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:03.440
making breakup difficult.

00:14:04.039 --> 00:14:05.519
Ms. Juan didn't know about Lin Fang.

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:06.600
Even if she had,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.759
she probably wouldn't have cared.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.480
After they

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:11.320
ended their relationship,

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.120
Zeng Jie realized his life

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.720
wasn't as comfortable

00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:15.879
as he'd imagined.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.320
His modest salary

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.720
and the income from ceramics

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.200
couldn't provide him

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.639
with a luxurious lifestyle.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.919
He refused poverty,

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.279
wanting to climb higher.

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:27.039
He knew conventional methods

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.639
wouldn't bring him quick success.

00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:29.799
At this critical moment,

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.919
he met you,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.440
Bai Xiaoling.

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:35.440
Young, beautiful,

00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:36.720
from a wealthy family.

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:37.879
He knew marrying you

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080
would quickly

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.519
transform his life.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.759
His eloquence and status

00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:42.960
had already captivated you.

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:44.200
All he needed

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.759
was to eliminate a small obstacle

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:49.399
in his path.

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:50.879
This obstacle

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.399
was his girlfriend,

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.039
Lin Fang.

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:56.200
To be with you...

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.360
To be with me,

00:14:57.679 --> 00:14:58.879
Zeng Jie killed Lin Fang,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.200
then he bribed

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.279
her only relative,

00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:02.480
her brother Lin Shan.

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:04.159
After removing this obstacle,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.320
he successfully married me,

00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:06.919
while I knew nothing about this.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:08.720
After marriage, Zeng Jie has been

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.399
having flings

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.600
with many women,

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:11.879
including your ex-girlfriend

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:12.960
Wei, right?

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.200
To avoid being caught,

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:16.320
he even tried to kill Wei.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.399
But I know Wei survived.

00:15:18.519 --> 00:15:19.440
Then he failed.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.919
After failing to kill Wei,

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.240
Zeng Jie turned to kill me.

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:23.559
First he staged a fire

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:24.320
to burn me alive.

00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:25.360
A month later,

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:26.879
he tampered with my car break

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.720
to cause a crash.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.240
Now he's trying

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:31.559
to kill me again.

00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:32.519
Big Hui,

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:34.080
is that what you want

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.120
to say?

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:36.440
Yes.

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:38.000
Zhang Ye, you're a lawyer.

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:38.960
You know the law.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.159
Since when have you two

00:15:40.159 --> 00:15:41.399
teamed up together?

00:15:41.919 --> 00:15:42.919
I...

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.679
We're just...

00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:44.720
We were scared

00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:46.039
this theory might be true.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.919
We didn't want you in danger.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.559
Right.

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:50.320
Last year,

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.879
you came to Mr. Ye

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.759
and mentioned wanting a divorce.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.759
Back then,

00:15:54.799 --> 00:15:55.720
you must've discovered

00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:57.080
some secrets of Zeng Jie.

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:58.600
Even if you don't trust me

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.080
or Mr. Ye,

00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.679
at least trust

00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:01.039
your own instincts.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.919
Exactly!

00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:03.039
What?

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.799
Yes, I wanted a divorce last year.

00:16:04.919 --> 00:16:05.960
But that was last year.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.679
Our relationship was strained then.

00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:09.240
But now is different.

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:10.559
He's improved a bit,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.799
so I changed my mind.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.039
I want to give us another chance.

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:15.519
I chose to live

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:16.759
my current life

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.879
and I'm content with it.

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:19.879
Reading at the café every day

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.240
is delightful.

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:23.840
If we lose all love,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.120
I'll reconsider divorce.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:26.120
But not now.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.120
This isn't about

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.200
divorce.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.480
Zeng Jie poses

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:30.679
a serious danger to you.

00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:31.360
He's dangerous.

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:32.799
You all think he's a murderer,

00:16:32.919 --> 00:16:33.759
then go to police!

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:34.720
Big Hui,

00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:36.000
you make crime-solving videos,

00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:37.080
should know

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.120
how to report crimes.

00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:39.600
Zhang Ye, you're a pro.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.240
Right.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.759
If Zeng Jie wanted me dead,

00:16:41.799 --> 00:16:42.720
he had many chances.

00:16:42.759 --> 00:16:43.720
Any day at home,

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:44.879
suffocate me with a pillow.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.279
I couldn't even fight back.

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:48.039
According to both of you,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.000
I've been teetering

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.240
on danger's edge for a year.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.200
What a miraculous survivor I am!

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:55.919
I told you

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
she wouldn't listen.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.480
She never listens

00:16:58.519 --> 00:16:59.159
to me,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.279
always maintaining

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.039
so

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.680
graceful.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.079
If I ever divorce,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.480
I'd still go to you.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.960
Come on.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.559
Just heed our advice this once.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.559
What advice?

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:15.759
Divorce immediately?

00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:16.559
Zeng Jie takes you

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:17.359
for a trip.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.160
Don't go.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:18.960
Why?

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:20.559
Will he kill me during the trip?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.799
If you don't go,

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:22.880
you could avoid

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.880
the risk.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.640
He wants to mend our relationship.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:26.599
I can

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:27.839
tell this.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.440
There's no reason

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.640
making him mend your relationship.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.559
Bai Xiaoling, you don't get it.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.039
People like Zeng Jie and me,

00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:35.839
we all come from

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.200
humble origins.

00:17:37.359 --> 00:17:38.319
My situation was better,

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.759
an average family.

00:17:39.839 --> 00:17:40.720
But,

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:42.119
(Clue)
we're both from humble origins.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.359
Humble origins?

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.200
This isn't the point.

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:46.400
Poor families

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.440
don't always produce

00:17:47.559 --> 00:17:48.880
greedy people.

00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:49.640
Understand?

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.240
But Zeng Jie...

00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:54.079
He chose this path himself.

00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:54.880
Get it?

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.000
Is that so?

00:17:56.279 --> 00:17:56.839
Buddy,

00:17:57.319 --> 00:17:59.480
through my legal consultations,

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.119
people like Zeng Jie

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:03.240
lack moral character.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.799
Stop blaming family backgrounds.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.160
Stop interrupting!

00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:07.640
Does she listen to you?

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.200
She's truly stubborn.

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:26.480
Enough.

00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:27.519
I'll take a stroll.

00:18:28.119 --> 00:18:29.599
When are you and Zeng Jie going?

00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:31.160
Probably in two days.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.799
The weekend?

00:18:32.519 --> 00:18:33.160
Maybe.

00:18:33.839 --> 00:18:34.519
Where to?

00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:36.000
I'll tell you when I get back.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.440
Let's meet at the café.

00:18:45.119 --> 00:18:45.880
Find out where

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.680
she's going to.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.799
Are you going too?

00:18:49.839 --> 00:18:51.079
I'm not always right,

00:18:51.559 --> 00:18:52.720
but I believe

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.599
in my deduction.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.119
The point is how,

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:57.920
buddy.

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:00.119
You can do it, Mr. Ye.

00:19:07.319 --> 00:19:08.440
Miss, these two new programs

00:19:08.599 --> 00:19:09.400
are perfect for you.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.079
We're running a promotion right now.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.200
Take 20 sessions.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:12.880
Okay.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.599
One moment.

00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:16.039
Ms. Bai.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:16.759
I've reserved

00:19:16.839 --> 00:19:17.799
this product for you.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.880
(Caorong Bank, Financial Product)
Just come to handle

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.759
the paperwork then.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.039
If it's inconvenient,

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:22.319
I can come to your place

00:19:22.359 --> 00:19:23.119
to handle it.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:23.759
Just tell me.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.960
No need. I'm not that busy.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.519
I'll come by myself.

00:19:26.759 --> 00:19:27.680
I'm going to travel

00:19:27.759 --> 00:19:29.119
with my husband in two days.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.720
Alright.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.000
I've paid you.

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:35.079
Don't worry.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.000
Those flowers

00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:37.200
will arrive next week.

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:38.359
I can deliver

00:19:38.359 --> 00:19:39.440
them to you.

00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:40.680
No need.

00:19:40.839 --> 00:19:42.559
I'll pick them up myself.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.480
(Male, Female)

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.279
Rest assured.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.599
You paid me,

00:20:09.599 --> 00:20:11.000
and I'll do the job well.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.319
Advice for you.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.640
Go to Yaotang Hotel

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.720
around 3 PM tomorrow.

00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:18.440
In the center of the lobby
there's a ceramic artwork.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.319
My husband will meet

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:21.599
someone there around 3 PM.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.079
After the meeting, he'll pass by there.

00:20:24.359 --> 00:20:25.480
You'd smash that artwork

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:26.839
right in front of him.

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:27.640
Why?

00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:29.160
Because that piece

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.599
is my husband's work.

00:20:31.079 --> 00:20:32.200
Are you sure

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.079
breaking

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.039
his work

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.079
would make him happy?

00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:37.759
Yes.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.559
Because that piece has flaws.

00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:42.160
He's always wanted to destroy it.

00:20:42.319 --> 00:20:42.839
Then you can

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.880
get to know him.

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:50.039
What if he demands compensation?

00:20:50.759 --> 00:20:51.440
He won't.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.759
If it really happens,

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.960
I'll cover the costs.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.880
What kind of flaw does it have?

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.319
A blemish flaw.

00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:01.000
What is it?

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.279
You can think of it

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.039
as an insignificant imperfection

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.440
that most people wouldn't even notice.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.079
But for certain individuals,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.920
it's unbearable.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.599
What?

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.880
My girlfriend asked me to come along
for a livestreaming

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.039
with a big streamer.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.319
Gain followers?

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.039
Think everyone

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.119
is a fool?

00:21:20.359 --> 00:21:21.240
She's just being used

00:21:21.319 --> 00:21:22.319
as a pawn.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.680
What a bestie!

00:21:44.079 --> 00:21:45.400
I thought you wouldn't come.

00:21:47.359 --> 00:21:49.160
I told you to meet at the café.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.400
I thought you meant

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.279
after the trip.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.519
You assumed

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.440
I couldn't return?

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.960
No! Not at all.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.759
The weather's getting chilly now.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.440
Where are you heading?

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.319
What do you want?

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.480
I'm Just asking.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.680
Do you want

00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:14.000
to monitor news

00:22:14.119 --> 00:22:15.559
of my destinations?

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.680
If anything happens,

00:22:16.759 --> 00:22:17.839
you'll know it right away.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.440
I'm Just asking, really.

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:20.599
Are you just asking,

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.640
or do you want answers?

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.720
I want to know.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.240
Mount Qingcheng.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:34.680
By the way,

00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:36.359
I didn't

00:22:36.519 --> 00:22:37.680
tell you something yesterday.

00:22:38.839 --> 00:22:39.400
Go ahead.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.039
Things about Ms. Juan

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:41.920
are true.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.240
Mr. Ye and I asked her about it.

00:22:45.839 --> 00:22:46.519
She knows you.

00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:49.119
When Zeng Jie first met you,

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.000
he mentioned you.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.400
Aren't you curious

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.240
why Zeng Jie told her?

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:55.920
Actually,

00:22:56.319 --> 00:22:57.079
when Zeng Jie

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.000
started pursuing you,

00:22:58.079 --> 00:22:58.920
many tactics

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.799
were coached by Ms. Juan.

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:02.319
Otherwise, Zeng Jie

00:23:02.359 --> 00:23:02.839
couldn't

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.119
win over you so easily.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.920
Hello, who is this?

00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:21.599
Recognize my voice?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.759
Ms. Juan?

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.039
How did you

00:23:25.359 --> 00:23:26.160
get my number?

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.559
It's not that hard.

00:23:28.279 --> 00:23:29.440
You're quite the celebrity.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.799
If I couldn't get your number,

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:33.880
it'd mean you're failing.

00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:36.960
Why contact me?

00:23:37.359 --> 00:23:38.519
Nothing special.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.000
I saw

00:23:40.759 --> 00:23:42.440
the Sunrise painting today.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.160
Made me think of you.

00:23:44.839 --> 00:23:46.759
Bad timing now,

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.319
Master Zeng?

00:23:57.359 --> 00:23:58.160
Suitable

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:00.720
for your refined taste.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.319
All these years,

00:24:03.519 --> 00:24:05.359
I watch you on TV often.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.279
Impressive.

00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:07.839
All thanks to you,

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.200
Ms. Juan.

00:24:11.519 --> 00:24:12.599
How's your wife?

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.440
Pretty well.

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:26.319
Three floors here.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.960
Except workspace,

00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:29.880
I guess upstairs

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:31.480
has rooms for lodging?

00:24:32.079 --> 00:24:32.799
Yes.

00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:35.880
Stay here frequently?

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.079
When work piles up.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.960
Got a marital issue?

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.519
If not,

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:44.119
you'd always go home
even with busy schedules.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.640
Have some water.

00:24:53.839 --> 00:24:54.920
This is what you offer?

00:24:56.599 --> 00:24:57.640
I'll make some tea.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.440
Ms. Juan,

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.279
why contact me suddenly?

00:25:04.599 --> 00:25:05.119
Nothing.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.240
Just thought of you suddenly.

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:10.799
Why so tense?

00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:12.279
I won't bite.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.400
Married several years already?

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:20.640
No kids yet?

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.359
No.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.759
Divorcing?

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.519
Not yet.

00:25:25.839 --> 00:25:26.799
Really?

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.279
My wife had an accident last year,

00:25:30.039 --> 00:25:31.759
and is still wheelchair-bound.

00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:33.680
Bai Xiaoling,

00:25:33.759 --> 00:25:34.359
right?

00:25:34.759 --> 00:25:35.240
Yes.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.319
You remember her?

00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:41.000
Of course, I do.

00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:42.599
Back then,

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:44.759
I gave you some advice to get her.

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:46.039
Yes.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.960
Her disability

00:25:52.079 --> 00:25:53.200
keeps you from divorcing?

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.319
Makes sense.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.759
You are

00:25:57.759 --> 00:25:58.960
a celebrity now.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.160
Dumping a disabled wife

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.880
would ruin your reputation.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.200
Her family's resources

00:26:08.519 --> 00:26:10.400
must've helped your career a lot, right?

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.400
A bit.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.519
Don't be shy.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.680
I mentioned this to you years ago.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.160
After marrying her,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.799
your biggest goal

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:23.799
should be to keep improving yourself.

00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:25.680
Right.

00:26:26.599 --> 00:26:27.680
It's all thanks to

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.000
your advice back then.

00:26:33.799 --> 00:26:35.640
She's not a fool.

00:26:36.319 --> 00:26:37.480
Has she discovered

00:26:37.559 --> 00:26:38.480
your real purpose?

00:26:40.359 --> 00:26:41.000
Yes.

00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:42.400
But

00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:44.440
she can do nothing about it.

00:26:45.119 --> 00:26:46.559
You caused her the accident?

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.279
No,

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720
I swear.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.119
However,

00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:53.599
this accident

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.680
did help me a lot.

00:26:56.119 --> 00:26:57.359
After that incident,

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.720
she didn't press me

00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:00.640
about returning the money so hard.

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:03.599
Zeng Jie,

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:07.400
you are quite fortunate.

00:27:10.119 --> 00:27:11.000
Alright.

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:13.519
I'm leaving.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.480
If nothing

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.160
unexpected happens,

00:27:20.359 --> 00:27:21.160
I won't

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.400
come looking for you.

00:27:33.079 --> 00:27:33.759
Ms. Juan,

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.000
any advice for me?

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.839
Regarding your wife?

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:47.319
The current her

00:27:47.319 --> 00:27:48.079
is different now.

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:50.119
Get a divorce soon.

00:27:50.359 --> 00:27:51.240
It's more beneficial.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.799
It doesn't matter to pay some price.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.519
Anyway, you've gained what you needed.

00:27:57.079 --> 00:27:57.720
Well...

00:27:58.319 --> 00:27:59.480
Get a divorce soon.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.400
Set your terms higher,

00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:02.519
she'll agree.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.000
She wants a divorce anyway.

00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:05.039
But

00:28:05.599 --> 00:28:06.319
I...

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:08.359
You don't want to pay the price?

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:10.119
Do you want

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.720
to create another car crash

00:28:11.839 --> 00:28:12.599
or some accident

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.599
to kill her?

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.640
Zeng Jie,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.680
I advise you to stop this intention.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.079
You've worked so hard

00:28:30.079 --> 00:28:31.680
to reach where you are

00:28:32.039 --> 00:28:33.759
and establish yourself in the city.

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:36.240
Everything you have now

00:28:36.359 --> 00:28:37.759
was hard-earned.

00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:39.400
Treasure it all.

00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:40.480
Don't

00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:42.279
ruin everything.

00:28:45.359 --> 00:28:46.240
Ms. Juan,

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:48.279
if

00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:51.119
you were Bai Xiaoling,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.319
what would you do?

00:28:56.519 --> 00:28:58.440
I'd devise a perfect plan.

00:28:59.839 --> 00:29:00.720
Find a way

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:02.279
to kill you.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.759
Take back everything that's mine.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.599
I'd keep all of my property.

00:29:07.759 --> 00:29:08.799
Or,

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.119
I'd do everything

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.319
to destroy what you have now.

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:15.519
Make you lose your job,

00:29:15.519 --> 00:29:16.720
and ruin your reputation,

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.519
forcing you back

00:29:18.839 --> 00:29:19.799
into your penniless life

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.440
filled with blemish flaws.

00:29:23.079 --> 00:29:24.039
Otherwise,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.720
how could I swallow

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:28.960
this injustice?

00:29:36.039 --> 00:29:37.119
But don't worry.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.920
Your wife

00:29:39.519 --> 00:29:40.519
isn't me.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.839
An ordinary woman

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.960
wouldn't act like I do.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.480
(Know why I help you?)

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.799
(Think you're handsome?)

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.119
(There are many people)

00:30:27.359 --> 00:30:28.680
more handsome

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.279
and younger than you.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.400
I chose you

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:34.400
because you're like me.

00:30:36.079 --> 00:30:37.799
You're willing to fight and sacrifice.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.720
Just

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.799
like me.

00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:44.640
I've told you about
my previous marriage, right?

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:50.319
The reason I'm telling you this

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.119
is to make you understand

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.519
choosing to marry Bai Xiaoling

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.279
is wise.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.920
But remember one thing.

00:30:58.559 --> 00:31:00.000
You must be absolutely clear about

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.720
what matters to you most

00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:04.160
in this marriage.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.119
Ms. Juan,

00:31:12.319 --> 00:31:13.240
actually,

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:14.799
I want...

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.160
You want success.

00:31:17.319 --> 00:31:18.200
So,

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.480
you need to be exceptionally rational.

00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:22.759
If you want Bai Xiaoling to trust you,

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.559
you can't rely on submission.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.440
You have to surpass her.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.640
The stronger, more decisive,

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.920
and cleaner you are,

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.759
the more she'd admire you.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.960
Really? Is that so?

00:31:37.319 --> 00:31:38.799
Those who admire you

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.160
become people around you.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.440
That's their misfortune.

00:31:44.599 --> 00:31:46.200
Most successes

00:31:46.359 --> 00:31:47.279
are meant for those

00:31:47.319 --> 00:31:49.279
who can't share them with you

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:50.759
to admire from afar.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.440
Find Liu Wei?

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:24.279
Wei and Zeng Jie

00:32:24.279 --> 00:32:25.400
must be connected.

00:32:25.599 --> 00:32:26.039
Find her,

00:32:26.119 --> 00:32:27.559
and we'll get something.

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:28.680
How?

00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:29.960
We've tried before.

00:32:30.079 --> 00:32:31.079
Think about it.

00:32:31.079 --> 00:32:32.559
What clues can we find

00:32:32.759 --> 00:32:33.720
when we saw Liu Wei?

00:32:36.759 --> 00:32:37.279
Incredible.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.039
I knew

00:32:38.079 --> 00:32:38.880
you'd start with it.

00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:40.079
Right.

00:32:40.519 --> 00:32:42.200
She was holding a milk tea cup.

00:32:44.119 --> 00:32:44.920
(A gray cup,)

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.839
(with a blue lid)

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
(and an orange straw.)

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.359
The cup was quite full.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.559
She just took a few sips.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.240
Within 200 meters,

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.920
there must be a milk tea shop.

00:32:53.319 --> 00:32:54.720
I'll go ask the staff about her

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:56.079
and maybe we can find her.

00:32:56.559 --> 00:32:57.759
Just

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.200
an easy-peasy.

00:33:02.359 --> 00:33:03.000
Big Hui,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.720
you do have some skills.

00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:16.400
You've decided to travel with him?

00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:19.319
Different scenery, different mood.

00:33:20.319 --> 00:33:22.240
I want to settle things with him.

00:33:24.119 --> 00:33:25.680
The mistake I made

00:33:27.039 --> 00:33:28.079
should be resolved by me.

00:33:28.359 --> 00:33:29.839
You are just like me,

00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:31.359
never accept defeat.

00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:33.279
I accept it.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.839
But I have

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.599
to reclaim my ground.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.039
You just don't accept defeat.

Hey! What are you doing?

His eloquence and status had already
captivated you. All he needed was...

00:34:45.376 --> 00:34:46.656
Sorry, one more.

00:34:46.656 --> 00:34:50.592
No, come on.

00:34:53.312 --> 00:34:55.008
This line again.

00:34:55.008 --> 00:34:59.680
Humble origins meant
humble family backgrounds.

00:35:00.288 --> 00:35:02.432
It refers to those without...

All these years,
Zeng Jie's been paying Lin Shan,

00:35:13.504 --> 00:35:16.544
because Lin Shan
hid the truth for Zeng Jie.

00:35:16.628 --> 00:35:17.600
Truth.

- Start from here?

00:35:31.168 --> 00:35:32.704
Yeah, exactly.

00:35:33.952 --> 00:35:36.224
I thought you'd go home first.

00:35:39.392 --> 00:35:40.320
What's the line?

00:35:41.568 --> 00:35:43.200
Well, what's the line?

00:35:44.704 --> 00:35:50.176
