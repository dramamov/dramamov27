WEBVTT

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.440
You won't leave us
even if Dad doesn't wake up, will you?

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.550
Of course not.
Why would you even say that?

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.020
I was scared you'd leave me and Dad.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.190
Why would I ever leave you?

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.390
What kind of mother
abandons her own child?

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.690
Besides, no matter what others say,
you're my daughter now, Se Ri.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.170
Yes, Doctor.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.440
What is it? It's so late.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.010
The chairman has regained consciousness.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.880
The chairman?

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.710
Okay. I'll be right there.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.550
The chairman has regained consciousness.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.950
Dad did?

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.620
I'm going to the hospital for a bit.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.560
Let me come with you.
I want to see how Dad's doing too.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.330
Not right now. It's late,
and they asked me to come alone.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.060
Besides, a crowd might just
make his condition worse.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.070
Then you promise you'll take me later?

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.370
Okay, I promise.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.770
How is he? You said the chairman
regained consciousness.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.640
Yes, ma'am. He has a pupillary response,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.050
and he's breathing on his own,
so we've removed the oxygen mask.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.650
We're currently monitoring his progress.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.590
Lucia, why am I lying here?

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.160
I'm not hurt anywhere.
Why am I just lying here?

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.490
You have to tell them for me.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.990
Tell them I'm fine.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.760
That I'm perfectly fine.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.830
So there's nothing else to be done?
We just have to watch him?

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.240
For now, yes.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.070
No other medical intervention
is necessary.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.980
All we can do is hope the patient
finds the will to wake up on his own.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.280
He can understand everything we're saying.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.050
That's a relief.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.690
It's a miracle
that he's even regained consciousness.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.150
Exactly.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.360
If we just give it some time,
I'm sure he'll wake up before long.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.930
He's a fighter, after all.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.200
He certainly is.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.870
Oh, right. Until the chairman
makes a full recovery,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.340
don't let anyone else in to see him
besides me, just like now.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.110
All the foot traffic will just
get in the way of his recovery.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.980
Understood.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.700
Se Ri.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.300
Se Ri.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.580
What are you doing sleeping out here?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.610
Have you been here all night?

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.880
I was waiting for Mom.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.720
Waiting for her? Where did she go?

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.120
To the hospital.
She said Dad regained consciousness.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.790
When?

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.820
How is his condition now?

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.390
No. I have to see for myself.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.800
Don't go. Mom said it would be disruptive,
so we shouldn't come.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.700
And you're just going to stay put
because she said so?

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.500
Who is Lucia to take charge of Father
and keep us away? She's not even family.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.180
- Because she said it's best for Dad.
- That's just what she wants us to think.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.110
She's trying to control access to Father
to secure her own position.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.980
That's why she's so desperate
to keep us away from him.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.620
You have to wake up.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.320
Chairman Min,
you can't let it end like this.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.530
You have no idea what's happening
at the company, do you?

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.970
Your eldest daughter is doing everything
she can to take over the company.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.300
She's going to suspend my authority
as acting chairman.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.300
You have to stop Kyung Chae.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.140
That brat's greed will ruin this company
and our family.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.140
You have to protect them.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.510
Protect Mingang and our family as well.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.980
I want to fight for you,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.920
but I'm too powerless right now.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.290
My stake isn't big enough
to fight your eldest daughter anymore.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.920
I'll give you all of my shares.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.790
Become the majority shareholder,
and stop Kyung Chae.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.060
As of today, Min Doo Sik's entire stake
belongs to Jung Lucia.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.470
You will be my successor,

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.040
become the next chairman of Mingang,
and set everything right again.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.670
I'm counting on you, Lucia.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.680
Ma'am, I told you,
you can't just go in there.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.150
What do you think you're doing?
Get out of here right now!

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.610
He's my father.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.020
I'm his daughter! Who's going to stop me
from seeing my own father?

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.190
"Father?"
You have the nerve to call him that?

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.450
If you had any shame,
you wouldn't be here.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.920
Did you just come to see
if the chairman is dead yet?

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.360
Watch your mouth.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.760
I'm not the one who wants
my father to die. You are.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.630
You should watch your own mouth.
He almost rotted in jail for life,

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.170
and who was it that saved him?

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.970
After all that, you still have the nerve
to walk around with your head held high...

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.280
and waltz around like you own the place,
and now you show up here?

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.850
What are you standing there for?
Call security and get her out of here!

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.530
Why in the world won't you
let me see my father?

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.030
That's because...

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.370
Madam Jung has forbidden all visitations.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.740
"Madam Jung?"
Since when does she get to call the shots?

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.040
I've been his daughter my entire life,

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.840
and you expect me to let some young woman
he just married take everything from me?

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.410
Are you saying...

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.910
that you intend to take the chairman
from his wife?

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.350
But legally, she is his legal guardian.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.880
Doctor Kim!

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.420
Let me repeat myself.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.820
Madam Jung is his legal guardian.
Without her permission,

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.360
absolutely no one is allowed in.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.330
So you were kicked out without checking
on the chairman's condition?

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.200
That woman is running the whole show
in there.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.100
I suppose so.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.470
Legally speaking, anyway.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.510
That's what makes the law so powerful.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.840
With the chairman in a coma,

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.080
he can barely communicate.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.080
If he were to sign his stake over to her,

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.610
there's nothing you could do to stop it.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.120
In fact, even if he were to pass away,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.220
unless his will has a specific clause
about the stake,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.360
it's a given
that she'll inherit the largest portion.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.160
What does the will say?

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.560
In the most recent version of the will,
the inheritance of the stake...

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.800
is not mentioned.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.200
So whether he lives or dies,
that woman still comes out on top.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:36.530
That's right.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.040
Unless they mutually agree to a divorce,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.070
she stands to gain the most
as the chairman's spouse.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.680
So if they get a divorce,
things would change?

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.080
(Mingang Distribution)

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.920
Yes, it's me, Mother...

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.290
- Madam Jang, what's the occasion?
- Is someone there with you?

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.590
Is that Lawyer Kim?

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.490
Yes, he was just giving me a report.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.760
Send him out.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.800
That sounds like Madam Jang.
It's fine, you can talk.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.900
What's the big deal?
It's not like we're strangers.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.200
And it's not like I'm out of the loop
on your affairs.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.170
You can speak freely, Madam Jang.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.470
Tell him to stop kissing up and get out.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.940
Who does he think he is, butting in?

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.880
Please leave.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.110
What are you doing? I told you to get out.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.820
(Mingang Distribution)

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.090
You can talk now. I'm alone.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.000
I gave that old fox an inch,
and now she's trying to cut me out.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.470
Jang Yeon Sook,
you're making a big mistake.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.840
Just because Min Se Ri
is your granddaughter,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.040
you think half of Mingang Distribution
is in the bag?

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:58.050
In your dreams. Not as long as I,
Kim Sun Jae, am here.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.990
No one else is coming.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.030
I've blocked the family from visiting.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.330
So don't you worry.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.400
How's the chairman?

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.410
He's regained consciousness,
but he still can't move.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.440
He can understand everything, though.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.880
Chairman, do you recognize me?

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.580
Yes, I remember.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.090
I remember everything now.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.460
Why I ended up like this too.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.360
Do you even know
who Moon Tae Kyung really is?

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.430
- What do you mean, "who is he?"
- Moon Tae Kyung is...

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.470
the son of CEO Han Kyung Soo,
Doeun Industries.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.270
Thirty years ago,

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.480
you had him murdered
in a staged car accident...

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.750
and stole his company and new technology!
He's the son of that Han Kyung Soo!

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.950
You think you can take me down?

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.620
- Chairman.
- Not a chance.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.590
Not a chance! Not a...

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.230
- Chairman!
- Not a...

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.860
Chairman!

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.870
Chairman, stay with me!

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.370
That's right. It was this jerk.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.270
This brat is the son of Han Kyung Soo
from Doeun Industries.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.740
He wormed his way into Mingang to get me,
to avenge his father.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.040
Moon Tae Kyung, you jerk!
You think I'll let you get away with this?

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.350
Lucia. Get away from him now.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.050
He's deceiving you all.
He's just using you.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.990
Chairman, what's gotten into you?

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.620
Please calm down.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.760
This isn't good. I'll go get help.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.630
Chairman, please calm down.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.170
Oh, no.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.470
- Did something happen to shock him?
- No, nothing at all.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.480
Okay, calm down and take slow breaths.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.110
Slowly.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.650
- Slowly.
- I'm going to take off.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.250
I'll see you at the office later.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.170
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.910
He definitely looked like
he knew something.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.320
There's no other explanation
for his reaction.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.930
Goodness, what a waste.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:00.330
This was a brand-new, limited edition.
It's irreplaceable, no matter the cost.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.930
No, what am I thinking?

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.170
You have to know
which side your bread is buttered on.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:09.570
If you play your cards right,
you can get anything you want.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.480
But still, this is such a waste.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.650
Whatever. Who cares if it's new?

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.820
As long as my husband gets
that director position, right?

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.990
This thing is a small price to pay.
I'd give up even more. Of course.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.640
This way, when Kyung Chae gets home,
she'll see them right away.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.110
Let's see here.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.910
Okay, the department store logo
and the luxury brand name right here.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.080
- What are you doing in here?
- Gosh, you scared me.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.650
Perfect timing.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.320
Manager Gong, what do you think?

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.150
It'd look great on Kyung Chae, right?

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.960
Ms. Kyung Chae doesn't like this style.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.090
It's not just flashy. It's gaudy.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.860
What? Do you have any idea
how much this costs?

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.930
It costs as much as a compact car.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:13.070
It could cost as much as ten cars,
and it's still not Ms. Kyung Chae's style.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.640
But what's with the sudden gift?

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.280
Are you trying to ask Ms. Kyung Chae
for a favor?

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.450
A favor? Don't be ridiculous.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.850
Can't family give each other nice gifts?

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.020
It's a token of my affection.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.930
Honey, how did it go?
With the gift for Kyung Chae.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.990
Don't you worry.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.630
I found something that's just her style.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.570
It's a new designer piece,
1 of only 3 in the entire country.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:46.100
I left it perfectly laid out on her bed.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.270
She's going to flip when she sees it.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.880
No woman could possibly dislike it.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.450
Gosh, you're the best wife. You did great.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.020
You don't get something for nothing.
And this is no small gift.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.190
She can't just take it
and pretend nothing happened.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.490
Just you wait and see.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.690
Kyung Chae will get rid of Soo Jung...

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.760
and hand the position over to you.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.830
- You think so?
- Of course.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.400
- Director Min Ji Seop.
- Hey, come on. I'm not the director yet.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.170
But I have to admit, it sounds good.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.840
Director Min Ji Seop.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:22.940
Director Min Ji Seop.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.410
Hey, Director Min!

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.440
Yes? What is it?

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.650
Director Min! Right!

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.050
It even sounds perfect.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.950
What on earth are you doing?
Have you finally lost your mind?

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:35.590
It's nothing.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.590
By the way,
about your director's office...

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.620
Keep it clean.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.630
And don't redecorate it to your taste.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.630
You must respect the next person's taste.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.130
The next person? Who?

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.000
Is there someone else who'd be using
the director's office besides me?

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.000
Honestly, the things you say.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.500
That position isn't yours forever,
you know.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.440
Don't tell me...

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.610
you're not after my position, are you?

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.010
Why? So what if I am?

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:10.750
I know things aren't going well at work
or at home right now, but still.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.230
That doesn't mean you should
start making trouble.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.490
Just focus on being
a proper vice director.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.300
You should have some decency.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.070
The nerve of her.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.540
Fine. We'll see about that.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.110
Soon, I'm going to give my entire stake
to Kyung Chae,

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.140
and I swear
I'll take your position from you.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.980
What? The chairman woke up?

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.380
This wasn't part of my plan.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.990
So how did he wake up?

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.420
I don't know.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.060
He can't communicate or move yet,

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.300
but he's definitely conscious.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.100
That's a relief, at least.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.400
If he could communicate
and had full use of his limbs,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.470
then we'd really be done for.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.470
So who's with him now?

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.540
Lucia.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.950
What? And you're just letting her?

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.910
- You have to get her away from him.
- What am I supposed to do?

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.420
She's blocked all family members
from seeing my father except for herself.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.560
Yes, it's me.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.730
If you're at the hospital,
just listen. Don't talk.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.800
Chairman Min definitely knows.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.440
That I'm...

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.540
the son of Han Kyung Soo,
the CEO of Doeun Industries.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.980
Back in the hospital room,
he didn't have any particular reaction...

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.110
until he saw me.
You saw how violently he reacted, right?

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.820
Once Chairman Min recovers from paralysis
and can speak again,

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.420
the first thing he'll do
is hire someone to take me out.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.220
Just like he did to Mr. Jo.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.690
That's how...

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.430
Chairman Min handles things.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.310
You're not really going to hurt Tae Kyung,
are you?

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.740
Have you forgotten what you've done?

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.450
If you hurt Tae Kyung as well,

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.180
you will never be forgiven,
not even in death.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.650
If you wake up only to destroy him,

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.830
I'll make sure you never wake up again.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.260
Failing to protect the one I love once...

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.230
was more than enough.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:41.410
So no one can get near him,
and only Lucia is by the chairman's side?

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.040
If this keeps up...

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.980
and my father can suddenly communicate,
even as soon as tonight,

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.880
he'll give everything to the woman
who was right there by his side,

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.250
including his stake and the company.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.620
That's usually what happens.
They leave everything to their caregiver.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:01.530
Then we have to get Lucia away
from the chairman.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.130
I already told you.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.430
She's my father's legal guardian,
so there's nothing we can do.

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:12.140
If they're legally married, then it's true
all the rights go to the spouse.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.640
The chairman's stake, his cash accounts,
and even his real estate.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.480
Anything in the chairman's name,

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.350
the spouse receives the largest share,
be it inheritance or a gift.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.450
That's what Lawyer Kim said,
but I don't know what to do.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.620
Whether my father lives or dies,

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.860
that woman is the only one
who benefits in the end.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.390
Then divorce is the only answer.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.400
- Divorce?
- We'll have to make them.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.430
You just said there's no other way.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.940
Are you happy keeping Father to yourself
and shutting his children out?

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.180
Shouldn't his children have the right
to know his condition?

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.250
Since when have you all been so concerned?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.990
I'm perfectly capable of taking care
of the chairman by myself.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.330
I don't need any help from his children,
so just stay out of it.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.200
Look at you, playing the devoted wife.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.000
Father must be so lucky to have you.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.800
Perfect timing. Everyone's here.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.840
This lady here has something
to say about Father.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.140
Go on, tell them.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.740
We may not be allowed to visit,

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.280
but as his family,
we deserve to know how he's doing.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.950
The chairman has regained consciousness.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.720
But his body is still paralyzed,
and he can't speak.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.290
What? When?

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.560
You should have told us right away!

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.830
Then we should go see him at least once.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.700
We've been worried about Dad's condition,
but we couldn't visit because of you.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.070
Then let's all just go together tomorrow.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:50.470
But this woman here...

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.570
is refusing to let us visit again,
just like last time.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.970
I wonder what she's plotting,
keeping Father all to herself.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:58.880
Like I said,

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.310
I'm taking care of the chairman.
I don't need your help.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.450
So without my permission, no one is to...

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.220
Still, shouldn't we see him
for ourselves at least once?

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.120
Just let us see Dad, please.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.560
That way, we can prepare ourselves too.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.860
Prepare yourselves?

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.560
For what?

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.190
I see.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.230
You mean, prepare to split the inheritance
when the chairman passes?

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.430
Is that it?

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.240
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.070
The chairman is going to walk out of there
on his own two feet.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.810
Let me say it again.
No one is allowed without my permission.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.540
Don't even think about
visiting the hospital.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:39.820
What is wrong with her, seriously?

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.590
You can't be so possessive of Father!

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:49.990
I can't let that happen.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.760
What if he says something about Tae Kyung
in front of his children?

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.510
What is all this?

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.050
Ms. Ja Kyung left these for you as a gift.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.010
A gift? Why all of a sudden?

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.480
I know, right?

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.150
I have no idea
why she's suddenly doing this.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.060
I guess she's trying
to get on your good side for some reason.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.820
I see.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.430
Goodness, Ja Kyung is so easy to read.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.540
So you're trying to separate Lucia
from the chairman?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.110
I'm looking for a way,
but it's not proving easy.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.310
It's ironic, isn't it?

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.780
In the past, you were trying
to get Lucia to marry the chairman,

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.820
and you stayed up all night
looking for a way, just like you are now.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.630
But now, you're doing the same thing
to make them divorce.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.230
I'm not the one who's strange.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.030
The situation has changed.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.600
Back then, I never dreamed
that Se Ri was Ho Se's daughter.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.440
Blood ties are a powerful thing,
aren't they?

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.910
What do you mean?

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.180
I always thought that to you, Lucia and I
were more than just a matter of blood.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.980
But now that your own flesh and blood
has appeared, it's like we're nothing.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.090
Tae Joo.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.120
I'm not blaming you, Mother.
I'm just saying.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.830
Anyway, let me know
when you've made up your mind.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.930
I have to do my part.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:47.680
Yes, Pan Sool.
What's this about so late at night?

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:48.980
Stella.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:54.080
I hope I didn't wake a sleeping goddess
from her beauty rest.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.990
No, I'm still up.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.560
Still awake at this hour?
I wonder what you're thinking about.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.890
The stars, the wind, a poem...

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.230
Or maybe Oh Pan Sool?

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:10.070
You did cross my mind.
But seriously, what's this about?

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.070
Well,

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:17.670
about that Mingang stake I entrusted
to you, Stella.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.840
I was just wondering what happened to it.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.850
I haven't heard from you at all.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.750
I found a good prospect
and made an investment,

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.620
so don't you worry.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.820
And here I was, completely in the dark.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:33.490
I couldn't reach you, and I was worried
you had taken the money and run.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.960
You scared me!

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.900
What are you doing sneaking around
instead of sleeping?

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.570
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.810
Your heart's still in your chest,
so you'll live.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.510
You're acting suspicious. Why sneak out
to make a call in the middle of the night?

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.180
- Who is it? What floozy is it?
- Why cuss in the middle of the night?

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.350
Just get back in bed and go to sleep.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.990
You're the one being shady,
so why are you getting so defensive?

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.960
Your face is scary enough
in broad daylight,

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.460
but out here in the pitch dark
with this light,

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.160
you'd even scare a ghost.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.100
Here, take a look.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.010
(Mingang Distribution)

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:35.890
You're here.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.890
You said it was important,
but you could have just called.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:47.930
I'm going to make your father and Lucia
get a divorce today.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400
What?

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.400
What are you talking...

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.200
Didn't you say
divorce was the only option?

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:57.340
As the chairman's wife, she's set to take
both the inheritance and his position.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.910
You expect me to just stand by
and watch that happen?

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.480
I'll take care of everything,

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.050
so from now on,
you just do exactly as I say.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.380
Got it?

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.330
Excuse me. Do you have a moment?

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.260
What brings you here?

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:25.970
There's something I need to say
to you and Lucia.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.370
- What's this all of a sudden?
- I'm sure you have grievances with me.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.710
I know how you two must be feeling.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.920
That's why this is something
I have to say.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.590
How about we meet at Pimaso
by the Mucheon Roundabout...

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.050
in about two hours?

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.560
Just say it here.
Besides, none of the other staff are here.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.630
No, this is something we need
to discuss in private.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.100
It's important.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.630
I'll be waiting,
so make sure you're there.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.680
Madam Jang wants to meet with us.
What should we do?

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.550
Madam Jang? What about?

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.250
She said she has something important
to tell us.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.360
We should probably hear her out, right?

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.420
Yes, we should.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.860
(Mingang Distribution)

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.600
Come with me to Hankuk Hospital.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.840
I can do that, but may I ask why?

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.270
You'll see when we get there.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.680
I'll be back soon.
In about an hour or two.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.220
Don't you worry. I'll keep a close eye
on him while you're gone.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.750
Thank you.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.280
You're here first. Lucia isn't here yet.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.530
- What's this about?
- What's the rush?

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.030
Let's order some tea first.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.630
Excuse me!

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.780
Ms. Kim Sun Young?

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.280
Yes, that's me. And you are?

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.320
You're not allowed in here. Get out, now!

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.490
Your mother is Kim Myeong Sook, isn't she?

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.620
And she's at the Dodong Nursing Home.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.960
How do you know my mother?

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.200
Did something happen to my mom?

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.860
Come with me, and you'll find out.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.830
She's not doing very well.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.800
Okay.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.550
What are you doing here again?

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.020
Go home. Right now!

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.330
I can't even stand to look at you.
Get out of my sight.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.360
Lucia!

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.830
What are you waiting for?
Help me carry him.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:45.740
We have to move him to another hospital.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:47.740
Somewhere that woman won't find him.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:08.020
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:26.180
Just lie there and think hard
about what you did wrong to deserve this.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.180
Is there anything we can even do?

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.210
There is one thing.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.210
The locked desk drawer
in the chairman's office.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.020
Baek Sul Hee, this is the last break
you're getting from me.

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.620
So you're really going
to go through with signing this?

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.990
I can't go through the same thing again.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.020
This awful bond was my doing.
I have to be the one to break it.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.960
