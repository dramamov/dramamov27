WEBVTT

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.140
Am I...

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.540
(Episode 101)

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.040
misunderstanding something?

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.080
Why do I feel like you've changed
all of a sudden?

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.020
I haven't changed.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.720
The circumstances have.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.390
What do you mean? What's changed?

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.890
It would take all day to explain.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.460
Anyway...

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.460
Just make Min Kyung Chae the CEO.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.260
And that's that.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.340
No, I can't do that.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.140
That would put us back at square one.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.640
Then what have we been fighting for?

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.510
"We?" Who said you and I are a "we?"

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.050
- Excuse me?
- What makes you think...

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.790
you and I are a "we?"

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.830
What has gotten into you?

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.640
As of today, Min Kyung Chae is
the CEO of Mingang Distribution again.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.070
And if you so much as lay a finger
on CEO Min without my permission,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.710
I'll expose you for who you really are,
Baek Sul Hee.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.250
Who do you think took in someone,
who had lost her daughter, went insane,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.190
became catatonic, and couldn't even move
from the trauma,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.350
and turned her back into a human being?

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.830
Do you think you could've come this far
without me?

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.860
No, you probably wouldn't even be alive.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.870
So that makes me the one
who saved your life,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.670
and the one you should thank
for giving you this new life.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.770
Right?

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.910
So...

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.140
Do as I say.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.750
That's how a decent person
repays a debt, right?

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.150
Why on earth are you doing this?

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.920
Tell me why.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.820
Don't ask for a reason.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.290
I'll say it again.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.490
Appoint Min Kyung Chae as CEO immediately,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.030
and have her start tomorrow.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.400
And don't even think about ousting her
until she decides to step down herself.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.670
I'll leave it at this for today,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.470
but if you defy me
and get any funny ideas,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.770
I will expose everything, from A to Z,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.110
about why you are posing as Jung Lucia.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.710
And the Min family will find out...

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.390
exactly how you've been playing them
for fools.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.150
Looks like Madam Jang
has handled the situation.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.320
Of course she would,
for her granddaughter's sake.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.530
She has to turn her back on Baek Sul Hee
and side with Min Kyung Chae at all costs.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.830
This is getting interesting.
The tables keep turning.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.770
As for me,
the sooner Min Kyung Chae takes over,

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.900
the sooner we can get married
and join the owner family.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.370
But when should I expose that...

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.540
Min Se Ri isn't
Madam Jang's granddaughter?

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.680
When should I drop that bomb?

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.500
What's wrong?
What on earth just happened?

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.140
- Tae Kyung...
- Yes, go on.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.180
Madam Jang...

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.590
Madam Jang...

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.290
What about her?

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.660
She told me to reinstate
Min Kyung Chae as CEO.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.430
Otherwise,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.530
she'll expose my identity.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.600
What?

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.600
That must have been a huge shock.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.440
Are you worried?

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.140
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.110
It's not like you can end a relationship
with the cut of a knife.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.950
There are lingering feelings and regrets.
That's just life.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.750
How long are you going to dwell
on your lingering feelings and regrets?

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.260
If you're going to be on my side,
you need to back me up all the way.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.420
That's the only way I'll become
the owner of Mingang.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.930
Min Kyung Chae.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.170
I made this decision for Se Ri,
my son Ho Se's flesh and blood.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.010
Betraying Lucia isn't easy for me.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.740
I know.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.510
I know it couldn't have been easy for you.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.110
But if that woman sticks around,

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.350
it's obvious she'll be bad for Se Ri.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.350
You have to remove any obstacles
in our Se Ri's way.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.990
Just like you did today.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.130
The one who will succeed me
as the head of Mingang,

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.890
who else could it be but Se Ri?

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.060
That's true.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.070
I can't let my granddaughter get attached
to the wrong woman.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400
Exactly.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.270
Why let her call another woman "Mom"
when her real mother is right here?

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.040
We need to set things right, starting now.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.240
What's wrong with her?
Where is she going at this hour?

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.170
She said she was going home early to rest.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.740
Something happened that shook her up.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.110
Shook her up?

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.050
Seriously, what else could possibly happen
to upset her?

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.910
You know how our family is. I mean...

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.320
Did my father die or something?

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.750
No, it's nothing like that.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.450
It seems she was shocked
by something else.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.020
What's so bad that she'd leave work early?

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.760
But if she just up and leaves,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.190
what about the CEO appointment?

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.100
Appointment or not,
hasn't it already been decided?

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.030
What nonsense is that?

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.700
That's something outlandish
my father-in-law would say.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.640
They've already decided? So who is it?

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.800
They'll start working at the CEO's office
starting tomorrow.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.850
I'm asking you, who is it?

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.180
Hey, have you heard anything?

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.620
Who's been named the new CEO?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.820
They've already named someone?

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.990
Director Moon said they will start
in the CEO's office tomorrow.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.960
And who is that?

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.400
How should I know?
Apparently, it's not you or me.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.570
That's ridiculous.
If it's not us, who else could it be?

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.000
My point exactly.
It should be either you or me.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.140
If it's neither of us...

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.010
Could it be Kyung Chae?

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.010
No way.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.680
She just lost out to Lucia
in company shares.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.550
Right now, there's no way she can return
to the company.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.880
Instead of all this guessing,
we could just ask that woman.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.990
She's not here. She felt unwell
and just left for the day.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.130
What did you mean...

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.900
when you said someone was starting
in the CEO's office tomorrow?

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.240
If this rumor is just from the grapevine,
I won't let it slide.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.510
Some things aren't a joke.
This is a huge deal for us.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.780
I know there's a new CEO designate,
and it wasn't the acting chairman's pick.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.280
That's all I can tell you.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.920
- If you're that curious, you'll see...
- A designate?

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.090
So tell us who that is.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.190
Why do we have to wait until tomorrow?

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.120
Come on, just tell us who it is.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.060
If it wasn't
the acting chairman's decision,

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.460
was it called upon by the deities?

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.160
Are you really not going to tell us?

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.400
Stop being so difficult!
We're going to find out eventually anyway.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.640
Exactly my point.
Since you'll all find out tomorrow,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.940
can't you just wait one day?

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.410
And one more thing, just in case.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.910
When you get home later,
don't bother the acting chairman.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.180
She won't talk, no matter what.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.500
I was just on my way to Legal
to ask you something.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.330
That's a surprise.
Why would you be looking for me?

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.970
Whatever it is, you must be dying to know.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.900
Others might not know,

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.470
but I figured you would, Lawyer Kim.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.640
It's about Madam Jang.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.780
What exactly is she trying to do?

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.580
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.880
What do you mean?
Did she have a change of heart?

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.650
What are you talking about?

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.220
Come on, why are you being like this?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.550
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.050
No, I'm afraid I don't.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.660
Besides, is it my job to know
what's on someone else's mind?

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.660
There must be a reason for this
that no one else could possibly imagine.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.760
And that reason...

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.730
is something you know all about.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.400
Isn't she supposed to be on your side,
Director Moon?

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.670
And you're asking me, the enemy,
about your own ally's business?

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.670
Look here, Director Moon Tae Kyung.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.980
You and I aren't exactly on speaking terms
for this sort of thing.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.280
But, for the record,

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.110
the one thing I do know for sure...

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.520
is that you and Lucia are done for.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.340
That woman is home, isn't she?

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.980
She came home this afternoon...

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.580
and has been cooped up
in her room all day.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.510
She won't even eat.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.020
I wonder if she's in shock over something.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.820
She was thrilled to get me out as CEO.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.190
Let's see how she likes her own medicine.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.390
I nearly lost my mind back then myself.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.490
I've been reinstated as CEO.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.430
Wait, really?

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.900
Wait, Ms. Kyung Chae,
are you really the CEO again?

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.330
That's what I'm telling you.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.600
What did I tell you?
I said I'd turn everything back, didn't I?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.570
Both the company and my Se Ri.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.020
I'll say it again.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.220
Appoint Min Kyung Chae as CEO immediately,

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.920
and have her start tomorrow.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.090
But if you defy me
and get any funny ideas,

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.290
I will expose everything, from A to Z,

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.430
about why you are posing as Jung Lucia.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.200
The entire Min family will find out
how Baek Sul Hee,

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.470
or should I say, Jung Lucia,

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.810
has been playing them for fools.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.610
But why?

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.340
Why all of a sudden?

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.490
(Lucia)

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.360
Are you really not going
to answer her calls?

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.260
There's no point in answering.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.170
Nothing is going to change anyway.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.070
So what's your plan now?

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.770
I need to make Min Kyung Chae
the chairman of Mingang Distribution.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.440
To do that, I'll need to secure her shares
and neutralize any opposition.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:46.910
I have a lot of work ahead of me.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.380
Does that opposition...

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.820
include Lucia?

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.720
I have no choice.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.950
We're on different paths now.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.820
What if Lucia gets hurt in the process?

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.890
That can't be helped either.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.800
After all, there's no such thing
as a clean break.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.810
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.120
So you're finally back.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.850
This is your rightful place,
no matter what anyone says.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.460
It took me long enough
to get my seat back.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.420
And it's been a long road.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.560
This is because of that woman's fault.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.630
Call a board meeting immediately
and oust that woman.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.300
But to do that, we must first suspend her
as the acting chairman.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.400
Don't worry. Be it shares or influence,
it's all on our side now.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.340
Did Madam Jang promise
to stick with us to the very end?

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.310
What's the point of a promise
made with cheap words?

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.310
I have something
that won't let her back out.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.710
You know what the most satisfying part is?

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.380
The most satisfying part?

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.120
Watching Lucia get stabbed in the back
by the one she trusted most,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.320
unable to recover.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.190
Watching it all unfold is so entertaining.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.130
And that's not all.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.000
Don't forget how Ji Seop and Soo Jung
were so sure this seat was theirs.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.230
Right.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.730
Those two were quite a sight.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.240
Who did they say showed up
at the CEO's office?

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.150
How would I know?
I just came to ask you the same thing.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.050
Director Moon isn't one
to make things up, though.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.020
Fine, let's go see for ourselves.
We can just go and check.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.290
It can't be, can it?

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.130
No, it couldn't be. Right?

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.130
Why? Are you scared
Kyung Chae will be sitting there?

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.030
But that seems a little far-fetched,
don't you think?

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.200
Father himself kicked her out recently.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.370
Things were just swept under the rug
because of the state Father was in.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.540
Otherwise, she'd have been kicked out too.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.140
Anyone else would have the grace to leave
after what she did to Father.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.250
But she's just so thick-skinned,
she'd stick it out no matter what.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.620
- Then who could it possibly be?
- That's why I'm telling you, let's go!

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.250
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.760
What?

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.730
What's with you two?

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.560
Did you see a ghost or something?

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.730
Why the shocked faces?

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.570
Wait, how are you even...

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.870
Don't tell me
you've been reinstated as CEO.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.740
- Can't you tell by looking?
- How could you come back here?

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.240
Did you think I couldn't?

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.840
Is that why you threw your stake in
with that woman?

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.710
Don't tell me that woman was the one
who brought you back.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.480
That's impossible.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.050
She'd have to be crazy.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.650
The shareholders' meeting was a showdown.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.120
One of you was going to get crushed.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.990
It only got sorted out
thanks to Madam Jang.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.060
That's what makes it even weirder.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.330
She clearly took that woman's side
and settled everything.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.800
She deliberately gathered us all
to make a point.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.300
So how could that all be reversed
overnight?

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.640
Are you that curious?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.610
When it comes to the Mingang CEO position,
no one is more qualified than I am.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.680
And Madam Jang knows it.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:06.880
What are you talking about?

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.910
If that's true, why make a huge scene
kicking you out just to reinstate you?

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.050
Is this some kind of game?

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.950
Anyway, I was reinstated as of today,

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.450
and you two must have been dreaming big
while I was gone.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.420
What a shame. Whatever will you do?

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.030
Mom!

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.040
Look at you. My radiant daughter.
What brings you here without a call first?

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.970
Perfect timing.
I had something to ask you anyway.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.510
Is your father-in-law really
in the hospital?

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.080
I heard he was unconscious.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.410
Who told you that?

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.320
It's not important who she heard it from.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.250
What matters now is that your father
has made a very important decision.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.690
What? What decision did you make, Dad?

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:55.060
Who knows. He's been saying that for days.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.430
Never mind that.
So, how is your father-in-law?

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.200
I'm worried he might not make it.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.270
They say he's unconscious,
but it doesn't seem as bad as it sounds.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.470
I don't know the details, though.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.340
Ji Seop's stepmother isn't allowing anyone
to visit except for her.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:13.440
My goodness. The new wife is certainly
playing the lady of the house, isn't she?

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.750
She even snatched the CEO position
from your sister-in-law.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.650
That's why right now,
Ji Seop and Soo Jung...

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.920
are having a showdown
over who gets to take the CEO position.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.420
What are you talking about now?

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.160
Ji Seop's stepmother is
the acting chairman in his father's place.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.200
So that means the CEO position
is vacant, right?

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.800
The issue is who's going to get it.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.300
So, who do you think
is going to get the job?

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.470
In my opinion? My husband, of course.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.940
I've done a phenomenal job supporting him.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.610
Is that even possible?
Your husband isn't exactly the sharpest.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.150
And it's not like you
have brains to spare.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.780
Honestly.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.790
She's always been a little slow.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.820
(Certificate of Stock Ownership,
Name: Oh Pan Sool)

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.020
(Company: Mingang Distribution)

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.260
What if Oh Pan Sool throws his stake
behind Min Kyung Chae?

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.000
And Kim Sun Jae's falsely-named shares
will be transferred.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.510
Then Lucia has her own stake
and Min Soo Jung's.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.010
As for Min Soo Jung,

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.380
she'll pull her support as soon as
she sees how things are going.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:26.180
Which means
Lucia will be left with only her stake.

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:31.090
If Min Doo Sik remains unconscious,

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.630
Min Kyung Chae,
as the majority shareholder,

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.830
becoming the chairman is
a done deal, isn't it?

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.800
Yes, it's me.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.440
What were you up to?

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.740
I'm back at the office thanks to you,
so I thought I should report in.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.440
Forget about reporting to me.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.210
Instead, figure out
how to become the chairman.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.980
Actually, I was just thinking about...

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.280
how to get you
in the chairman's seat quickly...

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:02.250
and make you the new owner
of Mingang Distribution.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.620
Were you?

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.890
I didn't realize
you thought so highly of me.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.460
I'm so grateful,
I don't know what to do with myself.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.560
You can thank my son, Ho Se, for that.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.330
I'm only doing this
because Se Ri is my son's daughter.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.770
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.900
Of course. I know that perfectly well.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.870
She's the only part of Ho Se
left in this world.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.910
If you understand, then raise Se Ri well.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.210
She will carry on your legacy
and become the head of Mingang.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.080
Make sure nothing hurts her.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.620
And make sure you guide her
so she doesn't go astray.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.950
Don't worry.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.920
She's my daughter.
Do you think I'd raise her carelessly?

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.590
I'm a mother, too.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.730
I know exactly how much you miss Ho Se.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.260
Fine.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.700
And another thing,
keep Se Ri away from Lucia.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.900
Right now, you're publicly playing
the part of her oldest sister,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.340
but you'll eventually have to tell her
you're her birth mother.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.540
Se Ri needs to get attached to you
more than just as a sister.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.770
That way,
the shock won't be as bad later on.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.240
You're right.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:03.050
Yes, but that woman has to actually
leave Se Ri alone first.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.520
If she doesn't listen,

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.380
tell her she'll have to answer to me.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.850
She'll get the message.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:10.920
Sounds like someone's here.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.460
I'll call you back.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.090
Who is it?

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.140
It seems you're not exactly thrilled
to see me.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.750
I can't imagine you have business here,
Moon Tae Kyung.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.110
On the contrary.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.920
Today of all days, I have a very important
reason for being here.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.420
And what might that be?

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.650
There's something I need to hear
from you today, Madam Jang.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.560
Now that you have Oh Pan Sool's stake,
you're no longer just the swing vote.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.030
Your faction clearly has
the upper hand now.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.140
Is that all you came here to say?

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:01.670
Lucia...

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.940
She's been deeply hurt.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.980
And it's because you, of all people,
betrayed her.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.210
Why would you go this far?

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.520
You of all people should know how it feels
to be betrayed by someone you trusted.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.890
Moon Tae Kyung.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.590
You listen to me very carefully.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.590
If you and Lucia...

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.230
stay out of my way,

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.400
I'm willing to keep
your true identities a secret.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.170
But if, by some chance,

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.800
the two of you become
an obstacle to my plans,

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.040
then I can't guarantee what I might do.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.870
- Madam Jang!
- I'm not making an empty threat.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.780
Who the two of you really are,
why you came to Mingang,

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.850
what you've been scheming all this time,

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.050
and how you've been operating
as one team...

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.920
I will expose every last detail.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.160
Why are you doing this? Why?

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.030
How have you been feeling lately?

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.730
Just okay, I guess.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.270
Don't get caught up in the drama at home.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.240
Se Ri, you just focus on yourself.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.440
I don't know what to do.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.240
Studying is the worst.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.050
What about something
a little more hands-on?

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.950
A part-time job would be
a good experience.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.990
You'd learn the value of money, too.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.190
A part-time job?

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.860
You could try waiting tables.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.390
It's great for learning to deal
with people.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.460
I'd be terrible at that.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.360
I've never done anything like that before.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.900
Is anyone born knowing how?

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.140
It'll be good for you if you try.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:40.900
Do you want me to look for one for you?

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.210
That's enough. Get out.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:50.750
I need to speak with Se Ri.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.720
So talk.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.320
I said get out.
This is a private conversation.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.390
Why can't you say it in front of me?

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.000
You're not planning to talk about me
behind my back, are you?

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.300
If not, then go ahead.
There's no reason you can't.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.770
Just say it. What's the big deal?

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.440
She said she wouldn't stand for it
if you kept clinging to Se Ri.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.840
- Who said that?
- I'm sure you have a pretty good idea.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:31.520
You stay out of this.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.220
Don't you see?
She's taking the hint and leaving.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.990
Because that's her place now.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.900
Mother.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.580
This is perfect.
I was just on my way to your room.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:52.940
Please have some fruit.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.110
I got these at the department store today,
so they're incredibly fresh.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.010
Forget it. You eat it.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.150
What are you talking about?
These are for Mother.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.950
Have you no respect?

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.160
Mother.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.960
Open wide.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.610
What's gotten into him?

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:32.350
Seriously, what is your problem?

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.550
How could you just snatch up the fruit
that was for Mother?

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.390
It's a lost cause, so just drop it.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.220
What are you talking about?
What does that even mean?

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.400
No need to suck up to her with fruit.
It's all over!

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.340
(Mingang Distribution)

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.850
She said she wouldn't stand for it
if you kept clinging to Se Ri.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.150
Who said that?

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.260
I'm sure you have a pretty good idea.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.400
What are you doing out here?

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.970
I can't just let this go.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.870
I have to meet her
and hear the reason for myself.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:30.440
The reason for what?

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.010
Don't tell me...

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.140
Madam Jang?

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.380
If she won't open the door,
I'll wait until she does.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.050
I have to see her and find out why.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.080
I'll go crazy if I don't.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.520
Don't go.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:46.760
You'll only end up getting hurt.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.190
Madam Jang...

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:52.330
- is not the person we once knew.
- But why?

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:57.730
But there must be a reason for the change,
isn't there?

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.200
Even if we have to go our separate ways,

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.570
we should at least be able
to say a proper goodbye.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.210
You expect me to just end things
without any explanation?

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.810
Then what did all our time together mean?

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:10.910
Did it...

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.620
Did all of that mean nothing?

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.450
It's me, Madam Jang.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.700
I got a call from Moon Tae Kyung.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.840
I heard you said you had to know...

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.740
why I betrayed you.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.840
I know you're not the kind of person
to do this without a reason.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.310
If you really must know,

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:16.810
what choice do I have...

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:18.950
but to tell you?

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.090
What is this?

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.830
A DNA test to confirm my relationship
with Se Ri.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.310
(DNA Comparison Test Results)

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.810
(Match Status: Match)

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:45.880
(Client 1, Min Se Ri,
and Client 2, Stella Jang,)

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.180
(are biologically related
as grandparent and grandchild.)

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.780
It says Se Ri is my granddaughter.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.580
She's the daughter of my late son, Ho Se.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.550
Is that reason enough for you?

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.090
As her biological grandmother,

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.260
I can't side with those trying to ruin her
and destroy her family business, can I?

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:24.410
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.930
You were like a mother to me.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.000
It makes my skin crawl to think about
the time we spent plotting together.

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.640
We have to.
She betrayed us just to save herself,

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.510
so we can't just sit back and take it.

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.310
From now on, Ji Seop, you're on my team.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.710
But how long will you be in that position?

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:54.810
Where are you planning on putting me?

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.650
If the tables turn on me overnight,
what am I supposed to do?

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.350
From now on, you'll do exactly as I say.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.190
Get rid of everyone who isn't essential.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.190
