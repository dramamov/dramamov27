Last night, His Excellency and I...

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.760
Kiss me again if you dare.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.240
Please tell me

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.960
you don't still have feelings for him.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.560
Can we kiss again?

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.220
Please?

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.320
Please, please, please?

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.400
Uh, you...

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.320
Last night,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.080
we kissed?!

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.080
Should we talk about last night?

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.560
I know you're up.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.760
Your call.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.360
When you're ready to talk,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.960
just let me know.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.040
Wait...

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.860
So...

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.800
What happened last night...

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.080
when we...

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.320
I was just drunk!

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.440
And...

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.080
you must be so annoyed

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.320
that you just kissed me
to get it over with, right?

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.100
But it's fine.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.020
It wasn't serious. Just...

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.280
think of it as kissing your dog.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.440
You really didn't feel anything?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.640
Whoa!

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.320
I definitely didn't.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.960
What would I even feel?

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.040
I'm so cool with it.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.280
Dorky Po.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.960
Down with Phony!

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.160
Father will hear about this!

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.400
Dao,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.440
you said you were all grown up, right?

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.240
So, should we settle this like adults?

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.240
How do adults handle these things, Ya?

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.780
Let's make a deal.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.680
If you don't tell Father about this,

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.360
I will let you ask for a favor.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.120
Hm...

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.120
Amusement park!

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.840
Amusement park?

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.890
Yes.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.200
I wanna go there before we get home.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.040
But I have to go back to work,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.120
and you have to go to school.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.560
Then, I'll tell Father!

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.100
How about this?

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.200
I promise
I'll take you there next Saturday.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.240
Sounds good?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.840
Or you can go with something else
if you want.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080
Fine!

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.200
Next Saturday will do.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.560
Alright, it's a deal.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.640
Ya, there you are.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.200
And so are you, Apo.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.680
Good morning, Ya, Apo.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.680
I have to head back to Bangkok now,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.600
so I wanted to drop by
and say goodbye.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.240
Take care on the way.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.240
Thank you, Ya.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.240
Thank you, too, Apo.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.760
I had so much fun last night.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.520
Goodness, Dear Yi.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.920
You're a saint!

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.640
Even when someone
almost killed you last night...

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.720
That's enough, Mother.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.680
Apo didn't mean to.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.400
That's right, Mother.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.800
I believe he didn't.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.960
Uh, then...

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.680
please excuse me.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.920
Have a safe trip home, Yi.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.000
Oh, look at him.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.440
Prancing away without a shred of guilt.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.720
Dear Ya,

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.960
send Yi off to his car, would you?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.560
Please?

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.560
Of course.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.920
Thank you.

00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:02.713
Take care getting home.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.600
Yes, Mother.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.320
What's up?

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.520
What's with the gun?

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.200
Is that for shooting aliens?

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920
Shoot me!

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.400
I'll be your alien.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.680
Argh!

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.680
You win.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.040
Second place.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.400
What do you mean?

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.360
Dorky Po's present...

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.240
holds a second place.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.480
The Northern lights were pretty,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.600
just an FYI.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.080
I'm glad you like it.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.360
Can I ask you something?

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.080
Are you and Ya fighting?

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.560
Uh...

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.640
Um...

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.680
I'm not.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.160
Even Daonuer can tell

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.760
that I'm avoiding His Excellency.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.720
And I even told him
I didn't feel anything!

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.560
If he realizes
I'm starting to like him,

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.520
wouldn't it be even more awkward?

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720
Like him...

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.100
Do you like Ya?

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.980
Uh, hey...

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.720
I don't...

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.240
Gotcha!

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.800
You really do.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.520
No, that's not how I feel.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.400
Fakey and Ya

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.320
sittin' in a tree!

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.840
- Fakey and Ya...
- Uh...

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.960
Daonuer, keep it down.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.960
If someone passing by hears us,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
they might misunderstand.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.640
Fakey and...

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.007
Please stop that.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.120
I will do anything.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.240
Anything!

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.000
Anything?

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.160
Mm.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.320
What are you boys doing?

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.129
Ya,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.640
Dorky Po has something to tell you.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:11.880
Uh...

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.040
Would you mind taking Daonuer to
the amusement park before we head home?

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.800
Didn't we agree on next Saturday?

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.360
Please, Your Excellency.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.520
I'm begging you, please take him there.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.680
Please, please, please?

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.320
I can do that today,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.120
but only if Apo comes with us.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.440
Me, too?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.240
Well, if Apo doesn't want to,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.800
we can just go ourselves
next Saturday, right?

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.540
What?

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.760
You have to come with us, Dorky Po!

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.640
Why, though?

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.160
If you don't, I will tell Father

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.560
about you, Fakey!

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.156
Dao...

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Daonuer,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.800
but that's not what we agreed on.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.920
Or do you want me to tell Ya

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.400
how you feel about him?

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.640
How do you feel about me?

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.640
No, I don't feel anything.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.680
Yes, you do.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.920
In an unhealthy way, too.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.850
No, I don't!

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.400
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.000
How could he know better than I do?

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.960
Or should I just tell him

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.920
that Fakey likes...

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.920
Whoa!

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.080
Alright.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.760
I give up! I'll go with you.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.320
Yay! To the amusement park!

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.000
Goodbye, Father and Mother.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.720
That was fun.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.160
- We'll see you at home.
- Alright.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.000
Goodbye.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.240
Carry my backpack.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.747
Boy...

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.720
Of course, Little Master!

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.160
Let's go.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.505
Hey, you.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.251
Hm?

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.120
I remember that

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.600
your place is on the way to my condo.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.040
Wanna go home with me?

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.240
I'll give you a ride.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.200
Uh...

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.360
It's fine. I'll go with Tor...

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.280
Good idea, Your Excellency!

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.160
I'll leave my friend to you, then.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.520
Catch ya later, Tai!

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.800
What? Tor!

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.600
Okay, we're all set.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.840
Come on, I'll take your luggage.

00:12:38.073 --> 00:12:38.953
Follow me.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:39.920
Wait...

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960
Madam,

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.520
a mysterious package
has been delivered.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.280
From who?

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.000
I have no idea,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.680
but it's addressed to...
Young Master Apo.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.920
Do you want me to open it, Madam?

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.000
Go ahead and do it.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.200
Yes, Madam.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.600
- How was it?
- What did Madam say?

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.200
She said...

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.720
to open it.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.040
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.839
What if it's a bomb, Auntie?

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.880
- What?
- Yeah!

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.880
A bomb?!

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.920
- How terrifying!
- Girl...

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.440
- What should we do if it's a bomb?!
- What should we do?

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.240
Then...

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.840
Who's going to open this?

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.960
The mightiest of us all.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.120
"The mightiest of us all"?

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.320
Me?!

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.520
Yes!

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.020
Go hide!

00:13:45.171 --> 00:13:46.211
Now!

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.520
- Open it.
- Just do it!

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.600
- How loving of you!
- Yeah!

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:51.960
- Hurry!
- Argh!

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.880
Do it now!

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.680
- Jeez...
- Go ahead!

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.600
- Make it quick.
- Damn, let me breathe!

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.120
Here I go!

00:13:59.160 --> 00:13:59.880
Go.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.840
Count to three.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.600
One...

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.360
two...

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.660
three!

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.280
Wait, wait, wait!

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.400
No, no...

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.640
It's not a bomb!

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.080
- Huh?
- What is it?

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.720
They are eyeballs!

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.160
[Go to hell!]

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.320
It says, "Go to hell!"

00:14:20.361 --> 00:14:21.160
- See?
- Argh!

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.240
- Argh!
- Goodness!

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.480
Who on Earth sent this
to our Young Master!

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.200
Wow!

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.040
How pretty.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.520
That ride looks awesome.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.760
Come here.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.120
You minion,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.480
I want popcorn.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.680
Get me some.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.480
Of course, Little Master!

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.920
Are you having fun

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.360
teasing Apo?

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.040
So much fun!

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.760
It's a blast teasing Fakey!

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.680
And...

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.680
what do you mean by
Apo felt something for me?

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.320
Ya, you gotta go on a ride with me.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.200
I'll tell you after that, like adults.

00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:08.800
You crave it so badly, huh?

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.240
Get the largest one. Let's see...

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:10.960
Ouch!

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.420
I'm so sorry.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:21.880
Here.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.200
I bought you the largest one.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.540
Thank you!

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.560
Let's go.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.640
Let's go, little monkey.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.040
Wait...

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.560
Am I smiling to myself?

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.120
Come here.

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:14.113
Hm?

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.360
Apo feels...

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.680
That's the first clue.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:23.880
Huh?

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.880
We didn't agree on clues, did we?

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.520
Well, do you wanna know?

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.080
If you do, then let's keep going!

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.640
Here's the next ride.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.560
Uh...

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.840
Excuse me,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.280
I'm not scared or anything,

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.640
but I have a child with me, so...

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.920
Are there any kiddie rides around here?

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.919
Actually, he can go on this one.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.320
He meets the height requirement.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.040
Yay, yay, yay, yay!

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.160
Let's roll!

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.280
Hey...

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.360
Uh, are you serious?

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.840
Wait,

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.880
why aren't you coming?

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.760
Daonuer asked me
to look after his belongings.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.560
Wanna do it again next time?

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.760
Do you want another clue?

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.600
Mm, sure.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.880
What's that supposed to mean?

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:06.920
Let's get going!

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.000
What?

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.400
I want to go on this ride!

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.160
I want to go on this ride.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.680
I'm sorry, Dao,

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.400
but children can't go on this one.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.120
But I'm not a child.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160
I'm a grown-up!

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.480
How about this?

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.840
I'll take you to the kiddie zone.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.200
There's a lot of stuff to play with.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.200
Sounds good?

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:40.240
No, I want this one!

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.440
Dao,

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.960
I'm afraid you can't really get on this.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.400
Do you remember what Father taught?

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.760
- "Rules are rules."
- "Rules are rules."

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600
Good job.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.980
How about...

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.260
Next year, when you're older,

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.120
I'll take you back for this ride, okay?

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.240
Alright...

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.640
We'll do it next year.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.400
When it's time,

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.680
Ya, I,

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.480
and Fakey will all be back.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.440
Alright.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.760
Uh...

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.120
I'll be back, then.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.760
I'm back!

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.200
What's that?

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.760
It's an action cam.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.160
This time, I'll go up there for you

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.680
while you hold this.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.360
I'll record

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.000
what it looks like from up there.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.760
And when you're older next year,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.680
you'll see it for yourself.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.480
Sounds great?

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.600
Great!

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.640
Yay!

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.920
Let's go, then.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.040
Find somewhere to watch.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.240
- Thank you...
- Wait!

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.520
Why are you here?

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.840
I don't want you to do this alone.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.040
But you're scared of heights, aren't you?

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.920
I am,

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.960
but I'm even more scared
of leaving you alone.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.440
Let me stay this way until the end.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.840
Having a stomachache?

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.960
I overdid my abs workout yesterday.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.920
I've got to poop!

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.360
Oh,

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.240
there's a gas station over there.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.360
Let's take a coffee break, shall we?

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.440
Yeah, works for me.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.040
Here we are.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.360
Hey, wait.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.800
Do you want a drink?

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.160
Something refreshing.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:56.960
I'll take it.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.080
Why so many questions?

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.200
I'm shitting my pants!

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.280
So, what's "something refreshing"?

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.720
What if I pick something
he doesn't like?

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.440
Holy shit.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.000
Welcome, dear customer!

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.280
- What can I get ya today?
- Hi...

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:24.840
Yes?

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.720
Is there anything refreshing
you can recommend?

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.200
Plenty, dear customer.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.020
Right now, we have ristretto.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.760
It's a bit stronger than espresso.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.360
But if you're not into coffee,

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.680
I'd recommend coconut matcha.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.640
Our matcha is exclusively
imported from Japan!

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.720
If that's still not quite your taste,

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.920
what about something fruity?

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.320
There's Golden Berry,

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.240
orange juice with
butterfly pea juice on top,

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.920
super refreshing.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.080
So, what would you like?

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.760
Hm...

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.800
What would you like?

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.680
I...

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.240
- I'd like...
- You'd like...

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.320
I'd like...

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.800
What would you like?

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.960
I'd like to have all three.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.440
- All...
- Yes, give me all three.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.200
Okay, we can do that.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.160
Did you buy out the whole shop?

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.520
Uh, just in case
you'd like some varieties.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.080
So, you can enjoy yourself
on our road trip, right?

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.520
Here's your coffee.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.800
I don't drink coffee.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.760
But the matcha sounds good!

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.840
Alright, Tailah doesn't drink coffee,

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.760
but he does drink matcha.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.760
Keep that in mind.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.400
I'll take care of the rest.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.200
Alright, let's hit the road!

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.680
Gentle, gentle.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.760
Now, take a bite.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.400
Hello, Lieutenant?

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.200
The Yue family has filed
a police report,

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.800
saying that someone's sent
Mr. Apo a threatening message.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.000
There's a note,
written in red ink, "Go to hell!"

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.560
What about the security footage?

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.120
Does it show who it was?

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.400
It was just a messenger.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.960
We're calling them in to investigate.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.920
Alright,

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.400
keep me posted when you know more.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.040
Give Mr. Apo a heads up, too.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.920
Ask him if there are any
possible suspects around him.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.200
Apo...

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.360
Uh, excuse me?

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.080
Yes?

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.840
Can I leave
my brother with you for a while?

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.520
- I have an emergency.
- Of course.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.600
Daonuer, stay with
this nice lady for a bit.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.120
Apo!

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.600
Apo!

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.080
Apo!

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.480
Po!

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.040
Apo!

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.440
Ya!

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.200
Po!

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.360
Where have you been?

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.000
I've been looking everywhere for you!

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.560
I got lost!

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.400
You know...

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.000
This place is freaking massive.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.840
I've never been here before.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.160
Gosh...

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.280
Everything's fine now.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.780
I'm glad you're okay.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.360
There goes everything.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.480
I've been holding back all day,

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.200
but my heart just won't be tamed.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.920
Your Excellency,

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.920
I wanted to talk about
our kiss last night

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.640
and how you've been
treating me so well today.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.600
Be honest with me,

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.320
how do you feel about me?

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.120
Apo...

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.840
I...

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.400
Ya, stop.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.040
No, Ya!

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.380
Ya!

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.680
Ya!

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.360
What?

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.360
Stop right there!

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.680
- Hey!
- Argh!

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:18.880
Who are you?

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.250
Why have you been stalking Apo?

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.880
I haven't.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.520
Don't you remember me, Mr. Suriya?

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.200
I'm sorry I scared you.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.400
I used to work at Siao Tawan Group

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.480
and thought you looked familiar,

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.040
so I wasn't sure if I should say hi.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.680
Huh?

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.080
That's it?

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.240
Yes, sir.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.040
How have you been, Your Excellency?

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.080
- Thank you so much
- Of course.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.320
- for looking after my brother.
- My pleasure.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.480
How are you?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.560
Were you running around for Apo?

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.760
Mm,

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.200
he was lost.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.680
Hey, the way you are now

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.000
is exactly like

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.360
when I got lost in the mall
when I was younger.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.120
Why?

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.120
You seemed really anxious,

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.680
running around

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.320
and looking worried.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.580
It's like you were afraid
you'd lose him forever.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.040
I know that you love Apo

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.000
like you love me.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.680
Dao,

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.640
can I ask you one thing?

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.180
From now on,

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.000
can you please not call him Fakey?

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.280
Also, please don't tell
Father and Mother

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.200
about Apo in disguise.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.640
Okie!

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.280
Good boy.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.080
Wait, Dao.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.920
Didn't you just say
you weren't gonna tell them?

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.100
It's not for that.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.400
I'm just gonna call
the driver to pick me up.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.360
I want to go home now.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.200
Alright.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:10.920
But before that,

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.360
I'll give you the final clue.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.280
Aren't we...

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.320
gonna play games anymore?

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.240
"Rules are meant to be broken,"

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.200
said Chan.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.480
I already gave you extra credit

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.600
when you went on that ride with Apo.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.440
What does that mean, Dao?

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.720
I don't understand.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960
Can we skip to the reveal?

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.520
Why is this so hard for you to get?

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.520
Me?

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.440
Mm!

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.640
Fakey likes you,

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.880
the same way you like him.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.240
Little Master Daonuer, time to go home.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.560
My driver is here.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.680
I gotta go now.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.840
Wait, really?

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:10.760
Mm!

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.200
Hey,

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.760
no need to follow them.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.680
I want to stay here a little longer.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.560
There are some places
I want to go with you.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.800
Do you want a plush?

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.560
Let's go with Moo Deng.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:35.920
You got it.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.040
Ow!

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.680
That was close! We'll get it this time.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.600
- There!
- Yay!

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.740
- You did it!
- Here.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.200
Moo Deng!

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.880
We're engaged,

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.280
but we don't have any couple photos.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.840
Here.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.560
This one's cute.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.160
Wow!

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.600
Come on.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.320
Let's go.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.560
We've arrived.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.240
Anyway,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.080
thank you for the ride.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:35.960
Mm.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.360
Ugh,

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.400
this road trip gets me pretty dizzy.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.360
Hey, wait.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.120
Hm?

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.360
I have something for you.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.440
What's that for?

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.360
I don't have a fever or anything.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.560
It's not just for that.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.840
It also works
when you feel exhausted.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.920
Let me peel this off.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.720
Hang on, almost there.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.480
Here, let me do it.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:12.990
Jeez, it sticks to everything.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.800
There.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.000
Eh...

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.320
Damn,

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.360
why's this so hard to put on!

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.680
Come here.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.640
I'll do it for you.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.880
Thank you.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.280
It's like you can read my mind.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:04.920
What?

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.400
Was that a bad joke?

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.160
It wasn't like that...

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.320
Honestly,

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.200
you don't have to treat me
like that all the time.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.760
I'm not really used to it

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.740
when someone treats me this way.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.520
Why not?

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.760
Probably because...

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.720
I'm not...

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.120
the main one in my group of friends.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.440
My friends don't really
treat me this way,

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.720
but it's me who takes care
of their feelings.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.600
Basically...

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.440
a sidekick.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.960
Don't treat others so much

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.920
that you forget about yourself.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.680
Okay?

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.080
Mm.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.280
By the way,

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.660
thank you

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.000
for today.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.280
Mm.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.600
Drive safe, alright?

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:11.960
Mm.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.840
Even though
I'm used to being a sidekick,

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.320
when someone takes care of me,

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.960
I kinda feel like the main one.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:18.840
Bye-bye.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.960
There's another place
I want to take you.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.000
Aren't you afraid of heights?

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.240
So why did you bring me up here?

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.200
I want you to witness it
with your own eyes

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.360
and see if you like the sight.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.640
Consider this
a belated birthday present.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.610
Do you like it?

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.100
I do.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.160
Happy birthday.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.940
I like you,

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.520
but you don't have to like me back.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.920
I know we're just a phony couple,

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.560
and one day we'll have to
go our separate ways.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.640
So...

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.460
If you don't have feelings for me,

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:46.180
you don't have to treat me so well.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.480
How do you know
I don't have feelings for you?

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.120
If you could read my mind,

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.800
you'd know...

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.560
that I like you.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.360
Does this make you feel anything?

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.320
I've already felt it.
