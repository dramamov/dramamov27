00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:52.795
I, Feng Zuoren...

00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:55.115
Long live Your Majesty!

00:01:56.475 --> 00:01:57.035
Rise.

00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:02.994
The jade pendant.

00:02:10.874 --> 00:02:11.395
I want

00:02:12.154 --> 00:02:14.074
to say something.

00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:15.234
Go ahead.

00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:21.835
Do you find

00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:24.794
this jade pendant familiar?

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:29.434
The late Emperor gave one to you

00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:31.794
and one to me.

00:02:33.355 --> 00:02:34.395
Yours wrote 'Virtuous'.

00:02:35.275 --> 00:02:37.674
While mine wrote 'Integrity'.

00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:49.714
You are...

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:52.234
I am your brother,

00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:53.555
Jia Xun.

00:03:16.275 --> 00:03:16.915
Father.

00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:18.915
You lie gravely ill,

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.635
yet the Crown Prince Jia Xun

00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:25.835
can't even attend to you.

00:03:26.954 --> 00:03:28.475
Such a nation's heir

00:03:29.154 --> 00:03:30.115
lacks virtue.

00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:34.995
For the sake of Hua,

00:03:37.035 --> 00:03:38.035
I implore you

00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:41.154
to appoint a capable heir.

00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:49.915
Father, look!

00:04:09.195 --> 00:04:12.954
I... grant it.

00:04:15.074 --> 00:04:16.594
Promise me

00:04:18.994 --> 00:04:21.874
to treat your brother well.

00:04:28.114 --> 00:04:28.755
Father.

00:04:41.154 --> 00:04:44.434
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees.

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:46.195
My son Jia Ji

00:04:46.475 --> 00:04:49.394
possesses exceptional wisdom
and virtuous humility,

00:04:49.795 --> 00:04:51.314
with noble character and talent.

00:04:51.795 --> 00:04:53.955
He is hereby titled Crown Prince,

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:55.675
so decreed.

00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:00.114
Thank you, Father.

00:05:00.515 --> 00:05:02.594
I shall live up to your expectation.

00:05:40.035 --> 00:05:42.675
I've exhausted my entire life

00:05:44.314 --> 00:05:46.114
for this throne.

00:05:48.075 --> 00:05:48.994
Yet in the end,

00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:51.475
everything

00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:53.915
proves meaningless.

00:05:55.475 --> 00:05:57.475
Are you here to seize the throne?

00:06:06.434 --> 00:06:10.114
I can't let you succeed.

00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:13.594
I beg you

00:06:14.664 --> 00:06:15.635
to spare the Xue family.

00:06:17.114 --> 00:06:18.235
What gives you the right

00:06:19.274 --> 00:06:20.834
to bargain with me?

00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:23.035
This throne is mine!

00:06:23.274 --> 00:06:24.475
Even after my passing,

00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:26.594
it shall remain with my heir,

00:06:26.714 --> 00:06:28.075
the current Crown Prince.

00:06:28.874 --> 00:06:29.755
The Xue family

00:06:30.075 --> 00:06:32.075
harbors you, a former dynasty traitor!

00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:34.314
All of you must die!

00:06:36.755 --> 00:06:37.714
If you agree

00:06:38.714 --> 00:06:39.554
to spare my family,

00:06:40.394 --> 00:06:41.314
I vow to you

00:06:41.994 --> 00:06:44.795
to leave Hua's borders with them,

00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:46.195
and never return.

00:06:47.314 --> 00:06:48.515
But if you remain stubborn,

00:06:49.795 --> 00:06:51.035
refusing to spare them,

00:06:51.475 --> 00:06:52.515
I have my ways

00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:53.994
to achieve my goal.

00:07:05.114 --> 00:07:06.154
You're threatening me?

00:07:08.114 --> 00:07:09.635
Do not presume I am blind

00:07:10.355 --> 00:07:12.035
to your countless deceptions

00:07:12.114 --> 00:07:13.314
with Feng Zuoren!

00:07:13.554 --> 00:07:14.675
I won't believe

00:07:15.274 --> 00:07:16.274
a single word from you.

00:07:17.475 --> 00:07:18.235
In the end,

00:07:18.795 --> 00:07:21.714
you'd still come
to steal my son's throne.

00:07:34.035 --> 00:07:35.195
Is it that difficult?

00:07:35.795 --> 00:07:36.554
Let me tell you.

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:37.955
The Mandate of Heaven

00:07:38.114 --> 00:07:39.355
shifts to the virtuous ruler.

00:07:39.515 --> 00:07:40.795
Like Yao, Shun, and Yu.

00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:44.195
Make your choice aligned
with Mandate of Heaven.

00:07:44.355 --> 00:07:44.874
Right?

00:07:47.274 --> 00:07:48.795
Call you Your Majesty one last time.

00:07:49.915 --> 00:07:50.874
Abdicate to me

00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:54.274
and I'll ensure
the Crown Prince's peaceful life.

00:07:55.314 --> 00:07:55.915
Guards!

00:07:56.314 --> 00:07:57.795
Seize them!

00:08:01.675 --> 00:08:02.834
They've bribed them.

00:08:04.314 --> 00:08:05.795
Even the guards recognize

00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:08.394
the throne won't be yours anymore.

00:08:09.394 --> 00:08:10.515
Capture them three

00:08:11.515 --> 00:08:14.594
and kill them.

00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:20.515
Wait, Xue Guardians are all in trouble.

00:08:20.554 --> 00:08:21.515
Want to summon them?

00:08:21.795 --> 00:08:22.795
No one would come.

00:08:23.195 --> 00:08:23.635
Get them!

00:08:24.355 --> 00:08:25.314
All of you, stop!

00:08:34.115 --> 00:08:35.394
Come on, hurry!

00:08:36.355 --> 00:08:37.154
Hurry! Come on!

00:08:37.355 --> 00:08:37.834
Come on.

00:08:38.555 --> 00:08:38.954
Come on.

00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:41.315
What are you doing?

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:42.555
Capture them.

00:08:44.915 --> 00:08:45.514
Feng Zuoren,

00:08:46.115 --> 00:08:47.594
escort His Majesty to safety first.

00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:50.875
The Crown Prince is still here.

00:08:51.714 --> 00:08:52.795
You escort His Majesty out.

00:08:53.274 --> 00:08:54.035
I'll get him.

00:08:55.154 --> 00:08:55.555
Go!

00:08:59.754 --> 00:09:00.555
Wait, what's wrong?

00:09:00.754 --> 00:09:02.154
I haven't finished. Why leaving?

00:09:06.154 --> 00:09:06.754
After them.

00:09:06.954 --> 00:09:08.795
He said the Crown Prince
is in the palace.

00:09:09.714 --> 00:09:10.194
Come on.

00:09:10.394 --> 00:09:11.355
You, chase the Emperor.

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:12.795
The rest, the Crown Prince.

00:09:12.834 --> 00:09:13.594
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:09:36.714 --> 00:09:38.915
Having pretended
as Crown Prince for years,

00:09:40.754 --> 00:09:45.315
now, I shall become the true Emperor!

00:09:56.834 --> 00:09:57.514
Stop that.

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:58.514
Go get the Crown Prince.

00:09:58.594 --> 00:09:59.514
Why daydreaming here?

00:09:59.754 --> 00:10:00.355
Let's go!

00:10:02.594 --> 00:10:03.035
Hyah.

00:10:03.834 --> 00:10:04.235
Hyah.

00:10:06.714 --> 00:10:07.154
Hyah.

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:08.594
- Hyah.
- Hyah.

00:10:09.355 --> 00:10:09.675
Hyah.

00:10:13.834 --> 00:10:14.274
Hyah.

00:10:14.435 --> 00:10:14.995
- Hyah.
- Hyah.

00:10:34.154 --> 00:10:34.555
Hyah.

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:35.235
Hyah.

00:10:40.475 --> 00:10:40.995
Whoa.

00:10:41.115 --> 00:10:41.714
Whoa.

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:43.675
Leave him, and I'll show some mercy.

00:10:44.634 --> 00:10:45.634
Miss Feng,

00:10:46.115 --> 00:10:47.074
I'm scared.

00:10:51.514 --> 00:10:52.394
Don't be scared.

00:10:53.514 --> 00:10:54.115
I swear I'll

00:10:54.274 --> 00:10:55.675
safely deliver you to His Majesty.

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:57.576
Close your eyes.

00:11:23.528 --> 00:11:24.168
Your Majesty,

00:11:24.394 --> 00:11:25.315
hide there.

00:11:25.514 --> 00:11:26.355
I'll divert them.

00:11:26.915 --> 00:11:27.555
Be careful.

00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:28.514
Keep alive.

00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:29.274
Alright.

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:30.355
Hurry.

00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:31.915
Come on.

00:11:32.594 --> 00:11:33.074
Hurry!

00:11:33.514 --> 00:11:33.995
Hurry!

00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:37.274
Get down.

00:11:39.954 --> 00:11:40.875
They're running fast!

00:11:42.115 --> 00:11:42.714
Where are they?

00:11:42.754 --> 00:11:43.435
I'm exhausted.

00:11:45.355 --> 00:11:46.274
How can we catch up?

00:11:47.176 --> 00:11:47.816
Check there.

00:11:48.754 --> 00:11:51.355
Your Majesty, I'm here to protect you!

00:11:51.514 --> 00:11:51.995
Chase him!

00:11:52.194 --> 00:11:52.795
- Go! There.
- Go! There.

00:11:52.875 --> 00:11:53.475
- Go!
- There.

00:12:17.235 --> 00:12:18.274
Drop the act.

00:12:19.074 --> 00:12:20.634
There's no one around now.

00:12:22.555 --> 00:12:23.475
You can...

00:12:26.475 --> 00:12:28.754
Reinforcements are coming.

00:12:29.235 --> 00:12:30.315
They won't escape.

00:12:30.915 --> 00:12:32.514
Let's search.

00:12:33.235 --> 00:12:33.795
Check there.

00:13:07.915 --> 00:13:08.555
Your Majesty!

00:13:09.154 --> 00:13:10.714
I'm here to protect you!

00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:22.235
This won't work.

00:13:23.154 --> 00:13:24.394
Reinforcements are coming.

00:13:29.634 --> 00:13:30.514
Take off

00:13:31.194 --> 00:13:31.714
your robe.

00:13:37.754 --> 00:13:40.235
You've finally shown your true colors.

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:41.475
Right.

00:13:42.394 --> 00:13:44.555
At lease, you could wear it

00:13:45.235 --> 00:13:47.915
before death.

00:14:08.394 --> 00:14:09.154
Wait here.

00:14:09.714 --> 00:14:11.035
Mr. Gu will come to join you.

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:16.954
To you, this robe represents

00:14:17.634 --> 00:14:18.995
your lifelong pursuit of power.

00:14:20.194 --> 00:14:20.915
To me,

00:14:21.915 --> 00:14:23.634
it's mere a flashy burden.

00:14:33.315 --> 00:14:35.235
There! The Emperor went that way!

00:14:36.074 --> 00:14:36.514
After him!

00:14:36.712 --> 00:14:38.184
Whoever captures Emperor Jia alive

00:14:38.634 --> 00:14:39.795
will be promoted as General.

00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:40.675
Don't kill me.

00:14:40.834 --> 00:14:41.675
Don't kill me.

00:14:41.795 --> 00:14:42.754
Don't kill me.

00:14:43.235 --> 00:14:43.954
Don't kill me.

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:06.154
Don't kill me!

00:15:06.555 --> 00:15:08.035
I'll grant you thousands of gold

00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:09.435
and a thousand cities!

00:15:09.915 --> 00:15:10.834
Sorry for coming late.

00:15:11.394 --> 00:15:11.944
Your Majesty,

00:15:12.514 --> 00:15:13.355
please have them.

00:15:38.274 --> 00:15:39.675
This is heavenly auspice.

00:15:42.754 --> 00:15:43.194
Hurry!

00:16:04.154 --> 00:16:05.315
You old man.

00:16:06.115 --> 00:16:07.235
Treacherous man!

00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:10.235
Try to manipulate the Emperor
and control the nation?

00:16:10.435 --> 00:16:10.954
Today,

00:16:11.754 --> 00:16:13.514
I shall kill treacherous ministers

00:16:13.995 --> 00:16:15.355
to uphold justice!

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.154
Are you addressing me?

00:16:18.714 --> 00:16:20.714
You harbored
the former Crown Prince years ago,

00:16:20.995 --> 00:16:23.394
and now you've secretly
ordered border troops back.

00:16:23.995 --> 00:16:25.555
It's you plotting rebellion!

00:16:34.435 --> 00:16:36.315
Heaven has warned you.

00:16:36.555 --> 00:16:38.355
Surrender now!

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.520
Grand Tutor Zhou,

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:41.544
our soldiers

00:16:41.544 --> 00:16:43.074
went to the Emperor Jia and his son.

00:16:43.394 --> 00:16:43.954
What to do?

00:16:46.035 --> 00:16:47.795
We have no choice.

00:16:48.315 --> 00:16:49.115
Seize him!

00:16:52.074 --> 00:16:52.675
Xue Fugui.

00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:55.754
I bet you won't abandon your own son.

00:16:56.634 --> 00:16:57.915
All soldiers, heed the order!

00:16:58.115 --> 00:16:58.555
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:16:59.154 --> 00:17:00.115
The Emperor's command!

00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:01.274
- We shall obey
- We shall obey

00:17:01.274 --> 00:17:02.315
- and execute!
- and execute!

00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:09.274
Don't blame me,

00:17:09.675 --> 00:17:11.035
but your father.

00:17:17.675 --> 00:17:19.075
Ungrateful son, come here!

00:17:32.915 --> 00:17:34.154
Know why the late Emperor

00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:36.514
made me Lord Dingyuan?

00:17:37.555 --> 00:17:38.874
From General Chen Tang's memorial

00:17:38.994 --> 00:17:41.754
to Emperor Yuan of Han.

00:17:42.514 --> 00:17:44.435
Those who dare challenge Han,

00:17:45.154 --> 00:17:46.274
will be perished!

00:17:47.715 --> 00:17:48.754
Take them away,

00:17:49.634 --> 00:17:50.915
awaiting His Majesty's judgment.

00:17:51.075 --> 00:17:51.474
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:18:24.075 --> 00:18:24.514
Feng.

00:18:25.315 --> 00:18:25.835
You're okay.

00:18:26.114 --> 00:18:27.234
Had I arrived later,

00:18:27.754 --> 00:18:28.555
you'd not be okay.

00:18:35.435 --> 00:18:36.835
You traitors.

00:18:37.634 --> 00:18:38.315
Die!

00:18:47.354 --> 00:18:47.795
Impressive!

00:18:55.195 --> 00:18:55.675
Look out.

00:19:15.075 --> 00:19:15.715
Father!

00:19:21.288 --> 00:19:22.788
Taking the Crown Prince down with me

00:19:22.994 --> 00:19:23.874
is a good end.

00:19:33.955 --> 00:19:34.994
Ridiculous!

00:19:35.354 --> 00:19:37.435
Want to die with His Highness?

00:19:39.795 --> 00:19:40.315
Your Majesty.

00:19:40.835 --> 00:19:42.474
I've safely delivered

00:19:42.754 --> 00:19:43.675
His Highness to you.

00:19:44.955 --> 00:19:45.754
Really?

00:19:47.715 --> 00:19:49.354
Are you that kind?

00:19:50.955 --> 00:19:52.715
I won't trust

00:19:53.595 --> 00:19:54.915
any of you.

00:19:55.754 --> 00:19:57.634
Killing me and my son

00:19:58.514 --> 00:19:59.274
would grant you

00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:02.075
the nation.

00:20:08.072 --> 00:20:08.648
Your Majesty,

00:20:09.394 --> 00:20:10.675
we risked our lives

00:20:10.955 --> 00:20:12.274
protecting you.

00:20:12.435 --> 00:20:13.595
Hope you feel our loyalty.

00:20:16.514 --> 00:20:17.035
Fear not.

00:20:17.715 --> 00:20:18.114
Go.

00:20:21.154 --> 00:20:21.715
Father.

00:20:22.274 --> 00:20:24.435
Why does he wear the imperial robe?

00:20:36.904 --> 00:20:37.555
Your Majesty,

00:20:37.994 --> 00:20:40.474
let bygones be bygones.

00:20:41.274 --> 00:20:43.955
I beg you return to the palace

00:20:44.234 --> 00:20:46.114
to govern for the people.

00:21:05.394 --> 00:21:06.795
I am terminally ill,

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:09.474
and my son is young.

00:21:11.154 --> 00:21:13.955
I have no one to trust.

00:21:20.435 --> 00:21:20.915
Jia Xun,

00:21:21.994 --> 00:21:22.595
if I want you

00:21:23.234 --> 00:21:25.555
to help govern the nation,

00:21:26.075 --> 00:21:27.234
after my passing,

00:21:27.634 --> 00:21:28.915
you can ascend the throne.

00:21:29.915 --> 00:21:30.835
Okay?

00:21:31.555 --> 00:21:33.154
I only ask one thing.

00:21:36.154 --> 00:21:37.675
Spare my son,

00:21:38.634 --> 00:21:39.595
your nephew.

00:21:47.912 --> 00:21:48.595
Your Majesty,

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:50.555
I don't know Jia Xun,

00:21:51.075 --> 00:21:53.394
but Xue Hexu.

00:21:54.595 --> 00:21:56.234
The Crown Prince shall reign,

00:21:56.835 --> 00:21:58.035
and none shall harm him.

00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:01.555
Your Majesty,

00:22:02.035 --> 00:22:03.754
consider the Xue family's loyalty,

00:22:04.154 --> 00:22:04.915
please spare them.

00:22:06.035 --> 00:22:07.154
To keep my life,

00:22:07.915 --> 00:22:09.715
it costs too many innocent lives

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:12.114
and troubles you.

00:22:13.715 --> 00:22:14.955
We all pay the price

00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:16.114
for our decision.

00:22:17.544 --> 00:22:18.075
Your Majesty,

00:22:19.195 --> 00:22:20.035
let the tragedy

00:22:21.234 --> 00:22:22.195
end here.

00:22:47.234 --> 00:22:47.795
Hexu.

00:22:50.394 --> 00:22:52.394
I don't think he'll come with me.

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:55.075
He hates me.

00:22:58.435 --> 00:22:58.874
Father.

00:23:00.035 --> 00:23:01.675
This is your chance for redemption.

00:23:02.195 --> 00:23:02.955
Don't run.

00:23:33.274 --> 00:23:34.354
Lord Dingyuan.

00:23:35.474 --> 00:23:37.634
Why would someone noble like you
to come here?

00:23:39.234 --> 00:23:39.835
Youshou.

00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:43.195
I'm here to take you home.

00:23:45.035 --> 00:23:46.195
His Majesty has spared you.

00:23:48.195 --> 00:23:49.435
Would he be that kind?

00:23:52.555 --> 00:23:53.234
I know.

00:23:54.915 --> 00:23:56.754
You're here to execute me.

00:23:59.354 --> 00:24:01.354
You'll kill me yourself.

00:24:02.915 --> 00:24:07.315
You'll personally eliminate me,
such a traitor.

00:24:09.555 --> 00:24:10.394
Fine.

00:24:11.514 --> 00:24:12.915
What a loyal lord!

00:24:19.595 --> 00:24:20.274
Youshou.

00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:22.634
All these years,

00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:24.555
I've failed you.

00:24:28.874 --> 00:24:29.754
I was wrong.

00:24:32.555 --> 00:24:34.114
How could you ever be wrong?

00:24:37.754 --> 00:24:38.754
You're always right.

00:24:40.474 --> 00:24:42.715
Everything you did was right.

00:24:44.595 --> 00:24:45.955
You're right to abandon me

00:24:47.394 --> 00:24:49.075
and choose him.

00:24:52.874 --> 00:24:54.075
You are loyal and righteous.

00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:58.474
You're the nation's pillar.

00:24:59.874 --> 00:25:00.595
Youshou.

00:25:03.394 --> 00:25:04.715
I was really wrong.

00:25:06.154 --> 00:25:08.274
I shouldn't have sacrificed you,

00:25:08.675 --> 00:25:11.394

never meant for you.
