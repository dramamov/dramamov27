Wow, that laptop just folds in half?

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.940
Most of them double as tablets these days.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.140
I haven't seen that model before.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.340
It's not officially out yet.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.510
They were given to students for beta testing.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.150
The deal is we have to report bugs. In our engineering department,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.220
we're not big fans of the tablet hybrids.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.889
Right! You're that quiz show brainiac.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.120

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.030
I don't know about brainiac, but I'll do my best.

Hyun Jun, you looked just like a real hacker just now.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.870
You should definitely use this.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.900

(Episode 2: Orientation)

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.280
I recently auditioned for a role as an engineering student.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.480
That was a real wake-up call for me.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.150
Now that our Modelling Major merged with the College of Engineering,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.750
I felt I shouldn't give our department a bad name.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.030
I'm also a student ambassador. So I'm representing Hangang...

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.600
as I go up against KAIST. We have many smart people here too.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.899
The library elevator, for example.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.730
Knowing how it works is simple for them.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.640
But of course, the students at KAIST are smart too.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.040
I once briefly met this girl at a part-time job.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.840
She said she was starting at KAIST, and she was really cool, too.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.180
- Her eyes had a different look. - Did you have a thing with her?

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.820
We only crossed paths for one day, but her eyes were... How can I say?

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.460
They weren't lively, they were dead. Like she was annoyed with the world,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.060
and yet, the things she said were so sharp and articulate.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.530
Where is all this nonsense coming from?

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.659
That's the engineering student vibe.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.699
We have students like that at Hangang University.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.329
Their eyes are dead in a cool way.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.870
We definitely have students like that.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.800
Any words for the incoming freshmen at Hangang University?

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.669
Protecting the environment isn't hard.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.370
Just clean up after yourselves.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.180
I was watching a video on Hangang's early graduation.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.310
But what is this?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.720
- Yes. - It's Ahn In Dae.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.020
Okay. We should go to KAIST.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.320
Yeah. Give us a call sometime.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.490
Okay.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.330
Okay, take care.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.490
Okay.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.060
That's not Ahn In Dae.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.670
Darn it.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.240
Bad news about "Rideshare Romance." They're starting season three.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800
Already?

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.310
You know the cast from season one are complete has-beens now, right?

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.750
But what about that drama?

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.710
Any word from the "Hacking King" audition?

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.050
You expect to hit a home run on your first try?

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.860
Come on.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.390
You're doing great right now, all right?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.860
Look at today's laptop commercial. Not everyone gets a gig like this.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.930
Just hang in there a little longer. Let's try for 1.5 million followers.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.200
It's a whole new pay grade. With your current follower count,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.970
we're barely making enough to cover your spa days.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.870
I spent 20 grand buying you followers.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.009
I do shower at home, though.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.810
It's just a figure of speech.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.650
This car alone costs 1,500 dollars a month to rent.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.720
What?

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.079
I can just take the bus or subway.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.350
Honestly, this car...

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.290
gives me a crick in my neck.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.290
That's not the point.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.860
I also think you should stop posting omakase pics on Instagram.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.400
The portions are tiny, and it's so expensive.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.600
Dude, you're a pro model.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.100
That's what models do, they look classy.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.270
That's how you positively influence people.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.950
You help the economy and planet. So we got this car for its eco vibe.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.180
By the last week of March. Yes, the submission is in.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.590
But I checked the site yesterday, and a harmful site warning appeared.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.820
Something about women's adult toys.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.360
No, that's not a problem. It's doable.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.660
Add push notifications to the app and fix the device's Bluetooth sync.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.860
Right.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.200
Yes, of course. I'm not a minor.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.800
- Okay, we'll ship it to you. - Okay.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.070
The Mount Mountain hiking club! Come check us out!

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.640
The campus at the beginning of the semester...

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.480
Right. After being cooped up for exams,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.150
all that pent-up youthful energy is bound to explode grotesquely.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.890
Through pointless club activities that are useless in the real world.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.990
But this is excessive.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.230
A man and woman in engineering? Is that a bug in the system?

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.070
What?

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.640
Right, a girl and a girl should be possible too.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.670
A Greater Korea.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.110
Right. And two guys as well, of course.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.140
But what is this?

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.110
There are just way too many couples.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.519
It's only the first week of classes.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.550
Should they be swapping spit so soon?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.660
Have they no problem swapping spit with someone of unknown health?

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.460
Whatever.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.670
I just need to stay centered.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.130
Just keep my head on straight.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.070
Careful not to scratch the floor.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.740
Come on, hurry up. We're losing time.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.450
Excuse me, we're setting up a shoot. Could you please go around?

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.510
Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.050
The actors' call time is almost up. Let's get everything ready now.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.390
How has this bastion of academia been reduced to a cheap film set?

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.140
- Hello. - Hello.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.940
- See you on set. - Looking forward to it. See you.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.440
And now this fine dust...

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.380
You said the post for this face mist is at noon, right?

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.180
Just keep it natural and casual.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.550
Also.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.690
Just show the hair dryer briefly. And get this. This part is cool.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.090
It says it even works as a garment steamer.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.190
So I just post about these things naturally and I'm done?

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.300
I really want to focus on the commercial shoot today.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.930
Plus, I have to do character study for this engineering student role.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.640
Character study for an engineer? What's that even mean?

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.940
To handle the laptop naturally for today's shoot,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.240
I figured I need to work on my fine motor skills.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.110
Right. Fine motor skills.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:49.910
Hey.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.150
The landlord texted me saying she needs to raise the rent.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.820
I thought our apartment wasn't a monthly rental?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.760
Monthly rent?

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.490
That's for the studio, not for here. Why is she texting you anyway?

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.900
She says she's a fan of mine.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.030
We have a studio?

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.940
The one in Nonhyeon-dong.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.100
Gosh, this fine dust.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.340
Isn't that your place?

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.110
Hey, what do you mean it's my place?

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.080
It's all your makeup and clothes.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.440
Your jawline looks undefined today.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.510
What happened?

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.080
I'm booking you a trainer. Right now.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.580
I'm fine, really. I'm fine.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.850
For today...

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.550
Use this.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.989
Use this on your face whenever you can.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.930
You can even do it in public, since we got it as a sponsorship.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.600
- Is this how it's supposed to work? - Right.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Go on.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.130
Hello! Hi there!

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.439
I hear they're filming in the lounge.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.570
Jinny and Kang Min Hak?

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.910
- They're filming together, right? - Wait, they're filming here?

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.079
Jinny came all the way out here?

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.180
What's so special about Kang Min Hak?

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.579
Kang Min Hak must be a big deal now.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.250
For Jinny to accommodate his schedule.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.880
His fans will say, "We see Jinny thanks to our Kang Min Hak."

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:00.950
- Stuff like that. - The rival fandoms are fighting...

00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:02.120
loud enough for each other to hear.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.320
Why is our school being put through this?

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.160
The campus is like a festival now. Think they'll cancel class?

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.700
Hey, it's the first class for the professor who came all this way.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.830
Whatever. I bet Jinny's going to be stunning.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.600
True. Even my friends who dissed us are jealous that Jinny's coming.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.240
Wait, this isn't the time for that.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.170
The school's trick to placate us with these trivial events.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.179
What if inviting Professor Winterbottom was to cover up...

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.750
the merger issue, and just a temporary fix?

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.620
Hey!

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.150
You're taking this class too?

00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:36.220
I thought you were done with your major.

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.189
Actually, I saw it on Everytime.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.260
His recommendation's a golden ticket.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.489
It's not just for the top Korean tech companies.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.930
Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon...

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.800
We're talking the big five in the States.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.030
Yes, I heard.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.670
But he doesn't just hand them out to anyone, right?

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.670
True. He only gives out one per semester.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.610
It's in the bag.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.310
(The best decision I've made in my four years at Google?)

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.010
(Meeting Professor Winterbottom, of course)

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.420
(With his recommendation, I'm at Apple HQ three days a week)

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.860
I'm only an intern at Microsoft right now, but...

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.790
if it weren't for Professor Winterbottom...

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.130
I'd still be in this Korean rat race,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.800
working 69 hours a week...

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.730
Excuse me, I have a brief announcement.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.439
Regarding Professor Winterbottom,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.440
who was starting to lecture this week...

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.310
there has been an unfortunate development.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.280
A Me Too allegation has been made against him in the United States.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.980
Michael, that monster!

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.279
Gosh, another Me Too case?

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.020
Isn't it probably just some student who's mad about a bad grade?

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.890
Me Too?

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.629
He's targeted because he's famous.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.730
Probably just mad about a grade.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.030
He's accused of serially harassing students, primarily Asian males.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.670
Asian male students?

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.500
This was a last-minute decision by the university,

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.270
so today's class will unfortunately be a pre-recorded lecture.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.070
The professor who'll take over the class from next week...

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.340
will be announced at a later date.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.280
- Excuse me, I have a question! - TA, I have a question!

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.550
Seriously, why is our school such a dumpster fire?

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.520
Okay, time to find a Plan B.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.920
"Convergent Talent Competition for the 4th Industrial Revolution."

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.090
What a joke. Seriously?

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.330
They're just trying to silence us. They even put it over our poster.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.400
- Darn it. - Wait!

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.930
Twenty thousand dollars?

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.570
What?

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.900
The first prize is twenty thousand dollars.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.340
A twenty-thousand-dollar prize.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:35.870
Twenty thousand dollars.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.880
Okay, so 20,000 times 4.4 and minus our food and coffee...

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.650
Yeon San, are you entering this competition too?

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.120
So you can leave someone on read in real life too.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.160
The Suspicious Embedded Systems comp prize was only 3,000 dollars.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.600
2,868 to be exact. They took 4.4% for taxes and fees.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.569
For my friends in The Trio who got second,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.299
1,000 minus 44 is 956 dollars.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.740
And if you split that three ways,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.380
that's about enough for two months of rent and utilities.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.480
Why don't we team up for this?

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.750
Weren't you trying to transfer to Seoul National University?

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.380
I can multitask.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.650
This time, instead of your last idea like that OCR Smart Reading Stand,

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.160
how about we do something a little more sexy?

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.090
For example, a device using location services...

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.690
like an automatic golf drive distance tracker?

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
I bet the dean and the university president would love it.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.810
Wait. "Teams must include students from at least two colleges..."

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.780
"as designated pre-merger." What?

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.650
Then we'd be better off teaming up with another major.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.650
Right, a different major...

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.920
- What's with him? - A different major?

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.990
(Dept. of Converged Physical Tech and Global Content Development)

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.000
Be careful not to break any of the school equipment.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.260
Hey, over there!

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.470
Hey, watch it!

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.040
Dude!

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.070
- Yes? - Come on.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.180
Yes, it is. Why?

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.510
That's a plastic straw.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.810
Didn't you bring your silicone one?

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.180
My bad, I forgot.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.820
I'll just drink straight from the cup.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.090
Exactly. You have to be consistent even when no one's looking.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.190
Right?

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.990
Why are you putting that in there?

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.630
It's for Jinny.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.430
It's that Milkis Zero she likes.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.640
Use this, not plastic bottles if you want to save the planet.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.070
- Jinny must have a lot of tumblers. - The more, the better.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.910
It's like double the environmental protection.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:56.910
- We'll heal the planet in no time. - Of course.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.020
All right, a little to the right. Just a bit more.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.990
Coming through. Okay.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.550
Hey, this couch.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.220
So this is why they went all out on the lounge interior.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.330
Let's decide on an idea for the competition first.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.870
I'm sitting this one out. Just participating in this...

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.570
would mean I'm supporting the merger.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.370
What if we protest by competing? If we get first place,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.110
we can donate the prize money to the anti-merger movement.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.240
What? All 20,000 dollars? Seriously?

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.550
Not exactly. We'd split it three ways first,

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.080
you donate your share.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.850
- Split four ways. - What?

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.020
- We need someone outside our major. - Darn it.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.920
Gosh, you sound like you already won it.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.130
A girl can dream, can't she?

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.960
Actually, I do have an idea that's a sure-fire winner.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.070
Of course, even if we do win first place,

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.740
after taxes from the 20,000 dollars, we get 19,120.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.340
If we split that four ways, it's not a lot of money, so...

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.639
it's not like I'm that motivated.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.310
But if we get the withholding slip...

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.080
and file for a tax refund, we can each get back 40 dollars.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.420
In that case, each person's take-home would be...

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.350
Hey! Did you become a sole proprietor or something?

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.090
Around 4,740 dollars.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.220
That's a pretty good amount. 4,740 dollars.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.120
That's almost a full ride for a semester.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.060
Hey, I'll donate my 40-dollar refund to the protest fund.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.030
Are you really that confident we'll win?

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.870
Okay. I'm in.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.609
- For real? - On one condition.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.480
Can I do a little something in front of the president and the dean?

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.380
Yes, as long as they don't revoke our award.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.980
Okay, I'll reveal the project now. Take a look at the sketch.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.990
Always one step ahead, Joo Yeon San.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.390
I rushed this sketch this morning, so it's still a little rough,

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.420
but I'd say I've fleshed out the core concept.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.190
Oh gosh, my battery's dead.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.530
I didn't back it up. A charger, I need a charger...

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.100
There's an outlet over there.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.470
Charger.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.390
No, our concept is sort of a '90s retro vibe, you know?

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.419
Like TG Sam Bo, that kind of vibe.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.960
Hey! Rookie!

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.020
Yes?

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.760
- Got the laptop ready? - Yes, it's charging on the side.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:22.830
All right, okay.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.800
So, what's the deal with Jinny's call time?

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.630
Her call time was over ten minutes ago.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.230
So Kang Min Hak is still a nobody, I guess?

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.470
Kang Min Hak is actually one of the hottest stars right now.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.210
Come on, Jinny was a world-class idol. You know what I mean.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:37.980
I was in elementary school back then.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.010
Jinny's here. She's at the front gate.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.510
Okay, got it. Stand by, everyone. Hey, you! Get the laptop ready.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.580
Got it.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.820
- It's Jinny! - It's Jinny!

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.890
- Can you sign this? - Please look over here, Jinny!

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.960
You're so pretty!

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.830
(Jinny: Center of a 2.85-gen girl group, once a global star)

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.369
(Solo artist, regular panellist on...)

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.870
("Match on Wheels," liquor ambassador)

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.370
Here she is, Jinny!

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.210
A round of applause!

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.780
Hi, everyone!

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.180
Hello.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.320
- Smooth Min Hak. - Classic Min Hak.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.590
Sir, once Jinny is seated, we'll do a quick pre-shoot.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.650
You good?

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.620
Hey, my bad. It looks better tucked in.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.860
Okay, so this is for our behind-the-scenes video.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.670
Jinny, a "Match on Wheels" panellist, and Min Hak, who was a contestant...

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.570
- Is this your first time meeting? - Yes.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.200
It's nice to meet you, Min Hak.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.510
When you were watching his scenes, you said he was cute,

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.410
and that blew up online, you know?

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.250
And maybe that's what led to you two shooting this commercial together.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.450
So what's it like meeting him in person?

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.190
He's even cuter in person.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.100
Okay, thank you.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.239
Let's call it "The Cloud Dream of the Nine." It's catchy.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.870
"The Cloud Dream of the Nine?"

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.810
- Yeah. - Kim Man Joong's Joseon-era novel?

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.980
I thought it was a Chinese restaurant.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.210
That novel is about life as a dream, this is about "dream starvation"...

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.850
All right, we're about to roll. Can we have quiet on set, please?

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.950
- Please step this way. - No, no, it's fine.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.020
Quickly, over here.

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.120
Please move back and keep it down. We're recording sound.

Solving common coding questions every night in your sleep,

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.900
or debugging in your sleep to greatly shorten deadlines.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.400
The catch is, even if you complete a mission in your dream,

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.569
it doesn't directly sync with reality.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:46.870
That would defy the laws of physics.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.710
Where do I even begin with this?

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.150
First, I don't want to build an app that makes you code in your dreams.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.420
That's just an example. Just follow the concept.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.520
From what I hear, it's impossible with our skills and technology.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.920
You know it's a campus competition, right?

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.230
There are way too many variables. Just off the top of my head...

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.290
I know.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.300
Temperature and humidity during sleep,

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.000
your main stressors for the day,

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.810
the sounds playing while you're asleep,

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.210
what you ate before bed, and so on.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.010
- You've thought this through. - You sure have.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.580
But what does all this mean?

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:35.150
It means that these variables will encourage users to participate.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.260
In other words, people will enjoy providing the input.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.790
Wait, so this isn't actually about controlling dreams?

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.560
You know I'm not the type to talk about such pipe dreams.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.860
What's going on? Can someone fill me in?

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.130
She's saying the app has a hidden agenda.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.840
All the user-provided sleep data will naturally accumulate.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.610
Then we pitch our ability to leverage that data to companies.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.810
So what do the users get out of it?

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.880
- A sense of self-efficacy. - Self-efficacy?

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.020
- Self-efficacy? - Yes. Though it's random,

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.790
they get a thrill, as if they chose the perfect option for themselves.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.819
They'll assign meaning to the results...

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.490
and keep using it out of curiosity.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:16.560
That's diabolical. Absolutely diabolical.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.030
Which is exactly why we need a title with a witty double meaning.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.070
This better not go against my principles.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.900
The security on this has to be top-notch.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.510
But this is where it gets really interesting.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:29.869
See, last night,

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.310
because of this person with their head in the clouds,

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.710
I couldn't get a wink of sleep. I even had a weird, jumbled dream.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.050
And that's when it hit me.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.790
What if even a ridiculous dream like this has its own logic?

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.990
What if you could guide your dreams? What if you could code your dreams?

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:51.130
This morning in my dev notes I was sketching a simple version.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.600
And suddenly, all these prompts started firing like crazy.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:55.670
Like the floodgates opened?

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.100
Yes, and while my brain was firing on all cylinders,

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.200
suddenly the internet in the whole area starts to crawl.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.770
And I had typed everything out like a madwoman.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.410
And I realised this might be a solution for dreams.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.750
I haven't had a breakthrough like this in four years...

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.750
Huh? What's this?

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.420
Wow! This is the new model, right?

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.320
- Hey, what are you doing? - Awesome. When'd you get it?

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.930
This isn't mine.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.800
Then whose is it?

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.030
All right, now bring the laptop to Min Hak,

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.570
and since it folds, let's bend it all the way back, 360 degrees.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.410
Hey, put it down! Put it down!

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.910
- Hey, can you see? Can you see it? - No.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.880
- You can't see? - No.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.820
Jump, jump! One, two, three.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.190
- Did you see it? - They switched the laptops!

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.260
Darn it.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.359
This is no good. We need to go around!

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.390
San, that way, let's go!

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.830
- Go back? - Yes, go back. Let's go.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.730
Hey, this way, this way!

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.600
- Move it, move it. - Out of the way!

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:06.900
Why is my laptop all the way out here?

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.510
Ugh, I threw this together so fast. It's totally useless.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.810
- If I just do this... - Coming through, excuse us!

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.680
- Hey! - Just a second! Hold on!

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.910
- Hey, over there. - Okay, okay.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.850
Let's have Min Hak try holding the laptop.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.690
Just hold it open like this for me.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.720
Right, thank you.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.590
So this model is out now?

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.400
The setup is you two are monitoring "Match on Wheels" on this laptop.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.530
"Match on Wheels?" Isn't that old? I see. So it's a 90s vibe.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.010
- Right. - Min Hak, make sure the logo shows.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.070
Got it.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.540
Was someone using this? It looks used.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.150
So I just pretend to look at it? Just pretend I'm looking at it?

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.780
Yes, we'll CG the screen in later.

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:53.380
And then, Min Hak...

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.089
Fold the laptop 360 degrees.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.890
You get the vibe? And then you hand it to Jinny.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.560
- All right, keep rolling. - And... shoot!

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.860
Shoot!

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.060
Okay, camera.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:04.730
Okay, ready!

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.830
Action!

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.500
They're watching "Match on Wheels." They look great together.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.770
- Min Hak, now the 360-degree fold. - Right.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.440
One, two, three!

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.340
Min Hak?

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.050
Min Hak? You just have to do it like this.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.150
Right.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.220
One, two, like this?

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.220
- Hey, Woo Young, go help him out. - Yes. The thing is...

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.720
No, I can do this. I've got it.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.830
Let me try again. Yes, just a second.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.400
One, two, three!

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:41.900
Here, someone help him with this.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.100
(Majors Only)

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.980
We're in.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.780
Stop!

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.380
- That's mine! It's mine! - Hey! That's ours! It's ours.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.980
- No! - We want some too!

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.220
- Mine! Mine! - Stop, that's mine!

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.860
- Kang Min Hak, you're mine! - Mine!

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.030
Thank you, my adoring fans.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.760
Please keep it down, okay?

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.360
Seriously, get out of the way!

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.730
Please be quiet! Everyone, please be quiet!

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.440
My laptop! That one's mine!

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.500
Quiet!

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.340
We're rolling sound! Quiet!

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.280
We're trying to record live audio here!

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.250
So please, a little cooperation!

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.580
Wow, you're really popular.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.190
This is what happens when you shoot on a college campus.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.460
Okay, let's channel this energy, refocus, and go again.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.530
Okay, ready.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:43.930
Action!

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.930
Like this! Like this!

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.300
Hey! Cut.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.840
- Wait a minute. Cut. - Cut. We're cutting! Cut!

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.900
Wait, hold on.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.739
It's fine. If the disk and motherboard are intact,

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.740
we can recover the data.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.880
- Right. - Sir, this product is defective.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.250
It's not supposed to bend like this...

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.890
What?

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.460
Are you okay?

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.990
I'm sorry.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.730
No, it's just...

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.670
It didn't come all the way out, so I think we can save it. Right?

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.000
What a relief.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.410
Alright, time for my daily good deed for the environment...

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.790
Oh my, this...

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.500
With something like Milkis,

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.440
you don't want it to get all sticky.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.510
So if you give it a light spray and wipe it down...

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.050
It's very eco-friendly, yeah. It's totally fine, really.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:24.750
Get it nice and even. There.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.460
Yes, let me just borrow this.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:33.530
Okay, just like this.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.209
Is that level of intelligence even possible within...

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.840
an institution of higher learning?

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.310
Like this...

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.180
It's drying up.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.320
What a complete fool.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.260
Is he smiling?

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.430
The model is watering the computer.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.430
This pretty much sums up this semester.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.030
I probably shouldn't say this,

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.530
but it's kind of picturesque.
