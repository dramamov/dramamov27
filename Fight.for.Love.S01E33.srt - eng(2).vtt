00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.430
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.270
Your Majesty,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.040
please withdraw your decree.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.120
Chu Yu hasn't spoken yet.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.310
Why rush to reject it?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.310
Chu Yu is a Chu,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.280
a female general who can fight.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.830
She shouldn't be confined
to the inner chambers

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.250
or trapped as someone's wife.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.840
I bear no selfish intent.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.840
Please take back your decree.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.840
No selfish intent?

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.960
Is Chu Yu more suited to be

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.710
a general or your wife?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.470
Do you think I don't know

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.080
what you want?

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.030
Your family has guarded Great Sui
for a hundred years.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.400
I want you

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.240
to guard it for another hundred.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.120
Privately,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.400
I have told you

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.430
about this.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.590
Are you going

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.120
to openly defy me now?

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.430
Is Chu Yu unfit to be a general,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.240
or can she simply not be my burden?

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.000
I know your intentions as well.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.890
That day at Spring Breeze House,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.260
I already made my stance clear.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.280
This decree is simply meaningless.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.590
How dare you!

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.800
Even at the cost of my life,

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.890
I must plead
that you take back the decree.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.190
I'm willing to serve Great Sui forever,

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.280
but I will not become

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.520
the sage or the paragon

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.640
in your mind.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.360
Guards!

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.430
Drag him out!

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.950
Your Majesty, please wait.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.710
Chu Yu.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.230
The Marquis of Zhenguo has refused.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.400
Answer me.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.600
Will you accept the title

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.080
or not?

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.150
I will not.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.660
(Memorial)

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.750
Chu Yu,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.380
do you know

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.400
what you just said?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.590
Your Majesty,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.840
why bestow this title on me?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.750
I wish to reward you.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.630
You've guarded the nation.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.950
You deserve to be a model
among the women of Great Sui.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.080
I know neither embroidery
nor needlework,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.120
nor do I understand the four arts.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.850
I only know how to wield a blade.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.630
Is such a woman truly

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.600
the model in your eyes?

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.430
By granting you the title today,

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.120
I hope that you will reflect

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.000
upon yourself

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.370
and strive to improve.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.510
The Wei family is upright in conduct;

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.160
as Mrs. Wei,

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.070
you shall hold yourself with propriety.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.920
This is a matter of mutual honor.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.040
Everyone shall be pleased to see it.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.840
All the more reason

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.510
I cannot accept it.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.760
I have never been

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.120
a gentle and virtuous woman,

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.070
nor will I ever become

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.240
the ideal woman

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.120
in your heart.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.480
Thus,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.040
I cannot accept this title.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.270
Since you refuse,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.560
I decree by imperial power

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.630
that you shall accept it.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.040
You have no choice.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.540
The ceremonial attire has been sent
to the Wei Mansion.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.430
You must remember:

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.610
Thunder and rain alike are gifts
from your sovereign.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.800
You can choose to wear

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.720
the attire of a titled lady

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.800
or that of a prisoner.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.520
Your Majesty...

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.600
We have no choice left.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.000
I...

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.310
I've spared their dignity

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.800
by not announcing this

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.560
before the court.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.680
Yet they still fail to see reason!

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.300
Please calm your anger.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.600
Minister Gu, you did well

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.040
at Spring Breeze House.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.270
I am most pleased.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.970
What reward do you desire?

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.350
Don't worry.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.640
Speak freely.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.470
Your Majesty,

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.630
my father was implicated years ago

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.770
by the Lord of Qin's treason.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.870
He's carried that false charge
to this day.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.200
If you could clear

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.480
my father's name

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.420
and restore his honor,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.870
I'd be deeply grateful.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.730
I dare not ask for anything else.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.600
You and your father are truly alike.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.600
Do you think I do not know

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.200
what kind of man Chancellor Gu was?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.600
The case back then was not a matter

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.310
of simple right and wrong.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.800
Had the truth been pursued to the end,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.390
Great Sui

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.000
would have plunged into chaos.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.920
Your father

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.870
understood this,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.680
and for the sake of the realm,

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.920
he offered himself up for punishment

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.480
to settle everything down.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.750
I have wronged him indeed,

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.160
so I promised to protect you.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.350
Minister Gu,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.120
you are young, capable,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.240
steady, and decisive.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.950
You've not disappointed me.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.070
Entrusting the Crown Prince to you

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.830
was a wise decision.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.040
But to let you remain merely a Minister

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.720
would be beneath your talent

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.870
and a disservice to your late father.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:44.830
So, tell me.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.870
Would you wish

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.680
to claim the seat
once held by your father?

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:05.540
(True Might)

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.400
Lan,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.750
Yu was suddenly granted

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.040
a title by the Emperor.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.950
What should they do?

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.870
If anything goes wrong,

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.190
they'll commit a crime
punishable by death.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.830
Why must the Emperor

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.480
insist on doing this?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.840
That day,

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.950
I heard Yun mention a few things,

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.830
but I didn't ask further.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.990
- Yu.
- Yu.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.120
Surprise?

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.200
I've come back again.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.240
It seems

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.270
that even fate

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:44.320
wants me to stay here.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:45.510
Yu,

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:46.870
are you all right?

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.550
Yes, Yu.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.080
You don't seem yourself.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.160
How could that be?

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.390
I always enjoy myself while I can.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.080
If there's a problem, I solve it.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.200
If I can't solve it,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.150
I'll cheer myself up.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.870
Yun was feeling down.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:03.630
He's gone to meet friends.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.570
Don't worry about him.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.990
Yu,

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.790
Yun told me

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.720
he'd made up his mind,

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.790
so I've chosen to respect your feelings.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.200
But with the imperial decree,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.270
you both must protect yourselves,

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.910
as well as the Chu family

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.920
and the Wei family.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.750
This isn't just about you two.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.510
Don't worry.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.870
Then Wanyue and I

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:24.790
will go and unpack.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.710
Go on.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.260
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.320
Why is no one caring

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.840
whether you're happy or not?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.320
His Lordship is so inconsiderate.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.150
At a time like this,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.110
he still went

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.720
to drink with his friends

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.960
instead of checking on you.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.680
Truly outrageous.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.510
Chun has said it.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.270
If Wei Yun and I cross the line,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.360
it'd be a crime punishable by death.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.030
But I don't understand.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.670
What's wrong

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.630
with being with the one

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.480
you truly love?

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.080
Why must it be so hard?

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.560
Hard?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.200
I don't think so.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.390
"Finding true love"

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.000
"and growing old together."

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.440
We've already achieved

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.720
half of that.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.960
I still remember what Madam Wei said

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.910
before she passed.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.080
"Apart both in life"

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.550
"and death."

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.150
While alive,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.550
they spent

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.750
most of their days apart.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.850
Her husband died on the battlefield,

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.200
and she wasn't by his side.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.520
That's the fate of the Wei family

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.150
and of the Chu family.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.670
But Wei Yun and I are different.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.320
We can fight

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.270
side by side

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.080
and see each other every day.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.590
However...

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.940
However, we just can't be a couple.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:59.790
My Lady,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.870
I was worried you'd be upset,

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.270
but you're the one comforting me now.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.360
Don't worry about me.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.900
You should think instead

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.120
about what kind of man

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.200
you'll marry one day.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.030
I'll make sure to find you a good one.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.200
No way.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.360
In this life,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.440
I'm sticking with you.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.890
I won't leave even if I die.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:23.510
I don't want that.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.480
You don't want me?

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.870
When you're old

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.080
and can't look after me,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.200
I'll just find a cute girl

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.360
- She seems calm to me.
- to serve me.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.920
She doesn't need our comfort.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.630
Then comfort me instead.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.870
It wasn't easy for me to sneak out.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.200
My father sent

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.030
so many spies to tail me.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:46.750
Let's go.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.500
(Fragrance House)

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.550
Ladies,

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.630
I'm back!

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.870
I've missed you all so much!

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.910
Lu Qiba! Lu Qiba!

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.960
Did you miss me?

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.750
Mr. Lu,

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.600
you haven't come for ages!

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:24.630
I thought

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.840
some young lady

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.680
had stolen you away,

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.030
and you no longer cared for us.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.720
No matter how far I wander,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.240
I'll always come back.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.720
This is...

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.480
The Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.030
My goodness.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.120
Ladies,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.720
the God of War in your dreams is here!

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:47.840
God of War!

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.630
Who is this?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.840
Everyone,

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.960
he's Mr. Song Wenchang.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.750
- Long time no see!
- Come on.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.000
Ladies, he's even more impressive,

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.460
a guest of immense fortune,

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.150
son of the Duke of Hu!

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.960
Mr. Song! Mr. Song!

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.040
I care about my reputation,

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.680
unlike you two.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:10.910
What if Jin finds out?

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.110
Yun,

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.510
I only came to help

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.550
because of our friendship.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.320
You must ask Yu to help me

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.270
explain to Jin.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.480
Mr. Song! God of War!

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.550
Come on.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.240
Have you moved on already?

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.230
What's so great about the God of War?

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.150
Without the weapons I made,

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.720
he'd have been beaten full of holes.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.150
You like it?

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.720
You can have that title.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.840
No, I can't handle that.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.000
Marquis of Zhenguo,

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.080
which of our girls

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.120
has caught your eye?

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.710
- I want her and her.
- Pick me!

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.120
- Her, her, her!
- God of War!

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.960
And her too!

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.040
I'll take them all.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.360
All of us?

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.360
That's wonderful!

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.200
Jin?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.200
Jin!

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.630
Catch this!

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.320
Is that enough?

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.550
More than enough!

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.790
Give me the finest private room

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.200
you've got here.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.360
Got it! Girls, come on!

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.840
- God of War!
- Hurry, ladies!

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.440
God of War!

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:10.880
Yun,

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:11.990
aren't you afraid that Yu

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.390
will find out about your wild ways?

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.150
God of War!

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.990
Yes,

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.720
but I believe she'll understand me.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.630
Go for it!

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.240
Song, you lost.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.080
I can do better.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.990
Drink up!

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:38.210
Drink! Drink! Drink!

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:43.230
Ladies.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.230
Why did you stop?

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.600
You've been down
since the court dismissed.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.510
You even dragged us here

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.670
to cheer you up.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.080
You don't need to say it.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.080
We're not fools.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.910
Obviously,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.690
you're trying to ruin your reputation.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.440
Yu is also very bold.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.870
She confessed to you in public

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.490
and even defied the Emperor.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.920
Yes.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.240
How nice she is.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.120
She's the best in the world.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.510
How about this?

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.960
I'll give you some money,

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.790
and you two can elope.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.750
Then I'd better work hard,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.670
so I can take your place
as the God of War.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.360
Save it, both of you.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.510
I'm not afraid of death.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.630
Why would I fear a title?

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.670
But this time,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.390
it's not as simple

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.320
as we think.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.270
If we cross the line again,

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.440
we'll implicate others.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:14.600
That is

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.030
what friends are for.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.390
It's fine.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.550
Go on and implicate me.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.200
I fear nothing.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.320
To me,

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.510
we're friends

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.680
and brothers-in-law.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.990
I fear nothing, too.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.600
Thank you for comforting me.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.240
We've come this far.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.670
Even fate

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.200
can't stop me from loving Yu.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.120
I'll fight everything

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.080
that stands between us.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.550
If not today, then tomorrow.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.750
One day,

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.750
I'll hold Yu's hand

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:53.720
openly and proudly.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.590
Young Marquis Wei

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.030
rose so high

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.270
only to fall so fast.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.200
After winning a battle,

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.290
he came back so arrogant

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.400
that he quarreled with the Emperor,

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:30.750
made a scene

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.480
at Spring Breeze House,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.650
and went to the brothel right after.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.590
Look at him now.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.680
Truly ridiculous.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.420
(Marquis of Zhenguo, Wei Yun)

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.190
More wine?

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.240
You...

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.550
You should drink less.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.860
Since you were given

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.350
the title,

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.440
Mother's been blaming herself.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.550
If she hadn't helped the matchmaker

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.830
find you a suitor,

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.030
none of this

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.070
would've happened.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.000
She feels she made a mistake,

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.390
so she sent me

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.000
to comfort you.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.680
The Emperor was behind this,

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.110
and Gu Chusheng helped him.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.260
It has nothing to do with Mother.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.240
Tell her not to overthink.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.520
Then,

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.960
are you really all right?

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.830
Wei Yun and I fought side by side

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:46.850
and risked our lives,

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.680
and this is what we got in return.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.430
How could I

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.510
possibly feel fine?

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.610
I'm just unwilling to accept it.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:58.640
Still,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.960
I know

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.000
how to cheer myself up

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.750
and find joy

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.240
in hardship.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.830
Young Marquis Wei and you...

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.000
If he doesn't leave me,
I won't leave him.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.440
That's all we can do for now.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.680
But I'll find a way

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.720
to give him a rightful identity

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.240
by my side.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960
Chu Yu,

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.590
I want to go there. Let's go.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.590
There?

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.480
I've been locked up at home for days.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.480
When I came here today,

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:45.920
Father sent a bunch of people

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.920
to follow me

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.310
to keep me from seeing Linyang.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.480
Fine.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.030
Are we really to be trapped

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.960
in the inner chambers?

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.550
Titles and marriage

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.480
are just to cage us inside.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.320
Chu Jin, don't you think so?

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.240
Jin is going

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.550
to marry your brother.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.720
If you scare her off,

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.030
Song Wenchang

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.030
might come crying to you.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.590
I want to marry him

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.790
because I love him.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.110
Besides,

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.640
I can keep doing

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.960
what I love that way.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.440
Song Wenchang

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.590
would never cage me in.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.310
That's because my brother

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.440
is kind and gentle.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.510
You got lucky.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.750
I'm not so lucky.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.510
I barely escaped being made

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.750
the Crown Princess

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.400
and found the man I truly love,

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.440
but I still got tripped up by fate.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.110
Besides,

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.000
I've saved lives on the battlefield,

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.070
but my family

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.910
still doesn't believe

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.310
I can be a good physician.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.950
Tuantuan,

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.550
my brother turned you down

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:08.630
because...

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I know.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.400
Linyang likes me,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.550
so he doesn't want me to waste my time.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.000
But he's never asked

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.110
if I want him

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.030
to do this.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.240
So, I've been wondering lately

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.480
whether we're right for each other.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:36.350
So, Tuantuan,

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.790
have you found your answer?

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:50.270
We came

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.110
to comfort you.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:53.440
Somehow, it's become

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.920
my confession meeting.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.480
I can't do this.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:58.950
It's fine.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.000
Having the three of you here tonight

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.400
makes me truly happy.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.590
I only came because Mother forced me.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:10.680
My Lady,

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.240
you're not being honest.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.720
It was you who wanted

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.440
to keep my lady company.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.750
Wanyue.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:17.590
Isn't that right?

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.790
Chu Yu.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.480
Come with me.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.150
Where are we going?

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.750
You don't belong here.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.000
Come with me.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:32.870
I'll travel

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.680
the land healing people;

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.440
you'll bring justice everywhere.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.310
If war breaks out,

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.320
we'll fight side by side for our nation;

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.110
if peace reigns,

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.720
we'll journey through the world.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.590
Chu Yu,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.350
you shouldn't be trapped

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.480
in the inner chambers here.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.920
You were born

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.880
to be a general.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:59.880
That title

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.680
is an insult to you.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.560
I'll...

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.840
I'll take you away.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.070
I'll take you away!

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.910
Tuantuan.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.970
Careful!

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.480
You're adorable when drunk.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.720
Exactly.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.920
She's so sweet.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.520
Thank you.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.950
I feel comforted now.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.510
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:30.350
I'll join you.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:38.270
Careful, careful.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.650
I'll give you an acupuncture shot.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:40.910
- Acupuncture!
- Fine.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.760
Acupuncture...

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.240
You'll be running like the wind soon.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.720
Fine, give me a shot.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.240
If I'd known
you couldn't hold your liquor,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.350
I wouldn't have brought you.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.160
Linyang,

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.750
if I said I don't like you anymore,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.830
would you be sad?

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.110
What a sin.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.480
How could an unmarried girl

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.750
say something like that?

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.270
I must report this to the Duke

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.480
so he can discipline you.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.000
What sin?

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.440
Then I'll say it, too.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.720
I like money

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.240
and Mr. Song Wenchang,

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.010
but I just don't like an old maid

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:14.450
like you!

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.000
You...

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.280
Slow down.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.760
Jin.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.520
Jin,

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.440
did I hear right just now?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:37.840
You said...

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.080
Wait.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.350
Mr. Song,

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.590
take care of Miss Song.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.510
You're a Marquis.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.680
How can you sneak around

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.240
outside my room

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.280
in the dead of night?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.840
I missed you too much

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.040
to wait till dawn.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.510
Besides, I haven't even gone in.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.280
Yu.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.910
Thank you.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.000
In the great hall today,

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.890
I defied the Emperor in public

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.240
and earned his wrath,

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.000
yet you stood by my side.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.040
Thank you

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:16.110
for everything you've done

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.350
for me

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:22.030
and for us.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.680
Unfortunately, I failed.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.090
That attire was still bestowed

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:31.750
on me.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:36.720
That identity is a shackle

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.110
forged by the Emperor and the world,

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.160
but it will never be our chain.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.400
To me,

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.590
it's just a piece of clothing.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.720
So, I've stuffed it

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.830
at the bottom of my chest.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.150
However, Wei Yun,

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.200
what stands between us now

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.520
is fate.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:59.790
Are you afraid?

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.440
I've been almost dead several times.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.760
What's there to fear now?

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.320
Besides,

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.750
you're by my side.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.180
I'm not afraid, either.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.880
In fact, today,

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.450
I dared to speak so boldly

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.690
to the Emperor

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.920
because of you.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.000
I want to stand with you,

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.370
steadfast and unshaken.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.240
What's that sound?

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.010
This is Winner.

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:43.150
Song Wenchang, Lu Qiba, and I

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.830
got it for you at Fragrance House.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.240
You went to Fragrance House?

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.070
I didn't do anything improper.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.480
I just played with crickets

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.320
and arm wrestled.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.980
The sun and moon can bear witness

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:58.030
to my feelings for you.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.720
I...

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:02.870
I...

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.070
I understand your intentions.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.790
But now,

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.440
you've your own reputation

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.590
this way.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:22.480
Is it really worth it?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.920
To be called a hero

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:28.400
may look glorious,

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.440
but behind it are

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:31.920
countless daggers aimed at my back.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.270
When the Emperor needs me,

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.400
I'm the anchor

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.340
that steadies the realm.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.880
When he grows tired of me,

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.030
I become a threat to the throne.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.630
I might as well refuse to climb higher

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:48.480
before someone decides

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.320
to pull me down.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.830
What a surprise that you've learned

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.370
to read the Emperor's mind

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.240
after the battle of Qingzhou.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.000
I've always been clever.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.030
But I wish you'd never had to learn.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.280
I have to learn,

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.640
so I can keep our family safe

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.350
and protect you.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.800
All right.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.010
I've received your gift.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:34.880
It's late; go back now.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.000
You can't be seen.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.150
I...

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:58.750
Turn around.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:23.870
Father.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.310
Father.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.150
Father, you're here.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.880
Is that how you review memorials?

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:35.310
Father, I was wrong.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.250
(From Wang Jingzhi:
We've won against North Qi.)

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.460
(Please disband the troops.)

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:45.580
(Utter nonsense!)

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.590
Father,

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:48.870
I...

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:50.590
I just think

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:53.000
the Duke of Ning's proposal
is ill-timed.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:55.750
We've just won a great battle.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.510
If we disband the army now,

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.510
wouldn't that chill their hearts?

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.590
You're right.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:07.550
Father,

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:08.390
the Governor of Jinxi

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:13.070
also keeps submitting memorials

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.780
to express his longing

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.160
to see you.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.300
But I think

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.240
he's trying to make you

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.920
transfer him back to Huajing.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:23.960
The war has just ended.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.990
Now's the crucial time
for rebuilding Jinxi.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.840
Also,

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.720
Wei Yun went to a brothel.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.960
Utter nonsense!

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.480
That's what's written here.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.340
(Wei Yun has grown bold,
frequenting brothels.)

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.500
(He's unworthy of your favor.)

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.620
(Please punish him severely.)

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.400
As expected.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:58.680
I knew it.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.960
He always goes

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:02.720
against my will.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.200
I grant Chu Yu a title,

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:05.580
and he runs to a brothel.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.000
I offer him honors,

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.920
(Memorial)
and he rejects them all!

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.030
Father,

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.510
calm down; don't harm your health.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.000
Wei Yun is always defiant,

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.310
but we're close.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.310
How about I go talk to him?

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.110
Huan,

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.000
I just want

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.680
to leave you

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.480
some truly capable men.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:31.000
But when you do this to them,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.040
will they still serve me?

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.270
I understand your intent.

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:37.400
I'll carry out your will.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.700
(Fragrance House)

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.640
Mr. Huang, you're here.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:46.750
Long time no see!

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:52.510
Wei Yun,

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.480
you really like it here, huh?

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.720
I've found the dog

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.070
as you asked.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:02.680
Xiaoqi!

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.800
Xiaoqi?

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.520
Is that its name?

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.320
Don't. Go away.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.510
Stay away from me.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:16.350
Xiaoqi.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:18.670
You always look

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.920
so mature and calm.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.510
Why do you panic

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:23.590
at seeing a dog?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.840
I...

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.120
It's fine.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.550
Let me smooth your fur.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.800
There, there. Nothing to be afraid of.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.110
From now on, I'll protect you.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.280
Lu Qiba!

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.200
What?

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.880
I'm not talking

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.000
to you.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.840
You...

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.800
Enough.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.110
If you're afraid of dogs,

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.510
why keep one?

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.460
That cricket from yesterday

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.300
suits you more.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.800
This dog belongs to Ms. Chu.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.150
No wonder.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.400
You should suffer more

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:06.800
in love.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:08.350
Young Marquis Wei,

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.800
enjoy your misery.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.760
Let's go, Wei Qiu.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.230
I've got a beautiful girl.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:15.110
Hey, you...

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:17.110
- Let's go.
- I...

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:18.320
Come on, let's go.

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:25.950
I...

00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.680
Come on.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.190
(Knowledgeable and Optimistic)

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:02.550
- Hurry!
- Get ready.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.720
So dirty.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.280
- Impressive!
- How can I give you to Yu?

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.990
- Don't bite me.
- Again!

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.320
You kicked it so high!

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.550
Yu.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.230
Xiaoqi.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.470
Xiaoqi.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:26.840
Is it really you, Xiaoqi?

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.230
Xiaoqi, is it really you?

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:31.840
How did you get so dirty?

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.680
Xiaoqi,

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.760
why did you sneak out?

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.360
Do you know how worried I was?

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:37.550
If you sneak out again,

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:38.670
I'll spank you!

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:39.510
Do you hear me?

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:42.200
You must've suffered a lot.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:43.350
No.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.480
I have to ask Lu Qiba

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.320
to make a wooden tag,

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:48.550
saying, "Dog in the Wei Mansion;"

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.110
"handsome reward for return."

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.510
That way, you won't get lost again,

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.360
right?

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.480
I knew you'd say that.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.070
It's already done. Here.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.630
Dog in the Wei Mansion.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.230
Reward for return.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:11.480
You're the one...

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:12.670
Who understands you best.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.670
Come on, wear it.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:25.400
Where are you going?

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.680
Come back.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.550
With this on, you won't get lost.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.840
Be good.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.960
You won't get lost again.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.230
Be good.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:38.910
Done.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.800
Does it look good?

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.720
Be good.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:50.430
Yu.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.820
You once said you wanted

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.600
to find a place surrounded
by mountains and rivers,

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:56.840
where spring lasts all year,

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.760
to live freely and happily.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.480
You value responsibility.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.160
When you leave,

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.360
the world will be at peace,

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.560
and I'll have no attachments.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.510
Wherever you wish to go,

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.320
I'll go with you.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.550
Don't forget to bring Xiaoqi.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:23.380
We'll bring this Xiaoqi along.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.030
This one.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.620
(Defend the Nation and the Throne)

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:42.960
My great general.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:45.510
(Marquis of Zhenguo Slays Su Can)
Do you know what this means?

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.240
The portrait is torn.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.240
Come on.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.760
Ms. Chu, you tell him.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.110
This portrait

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:54.920
can no longer be hung
at the gate pillars.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.760
You...

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.800
You're wrong!

00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:59.920
It means

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:01.420
the people have lost faith in you.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.320
It means you're not
the God of War anymore.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:05.030
Why would you debase yourself,

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:06.800
frequenting such a wonderful place...

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.800
an indecent place

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:13.190
and staying out so late?

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.590
Thank you for your concern.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.500
But when did I ever admit

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.340
I was the God of War?

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:18.550
Besides,

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:20.330
the God of War the Emperor wants

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:21.440
is one without emotions.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.550
But without emotions,
how could I understand

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.440
the people?

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.720
Fine.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.360
You can say that to me.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:34.830
Don't go repeating it outside.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:36.570
I'll be honest with you.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.000
I actually think you two

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.840
are a perfect match.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.320
But Father is

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.440
deeply displeased with you.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:42.550
I can't change that,

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:43.510
so I'm here to warn you.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:45.480
Why must you

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.480
keep opposing him?

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.510
You're slapping his face.

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:50.190
If he gets angry,

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.960
can you bear the consequences?

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.990
Aren't you afraid...

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:57.400
Aren't you afraid he'll cast you aside

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.240
in fury?

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.350
I heard

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.110
Mr. Song

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.030
is fierce and bold in battle

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.920
as if he has nine lives.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.000
Thank you for the warning.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:07.920
But I know

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:09.630
I've done my utmost.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.000
If anyone questions me,

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.360
I can say without guilt

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:14.370
that my conscience is clear.

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.320
If the Emperor abandons me

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:17.390
and despises me,

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.060
as long as I can still lead troops,

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.750
I don't mind being an ordinary soldier.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:22.710
- I...
- I truly don't care

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.630
about the title of the God of War.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.550
Whoever wants it can have it.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:27.390
You...

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.230
Come on, man.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.360
I've said everything I can,

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:32.800
but you just don't listen.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:35.350
You...

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.870
Why's this so sweet?

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.360
I don't like this.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.590
Someone does.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.280
Now, the Crown Prince

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.800
(True Might)

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.800
finally shows

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.910
the makings of a true heir.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.540
When the nation is in peril,

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.120
one must rise to the challenge

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:07.070
and bear the burden.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.360
Didn't you grow up that way, too?

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:12.320
He's even a year younger than me.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.400
But in my heart,

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.150
you're always the best.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.130
Do you really think so?

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.870
Of course.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.240
What do you think...

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.400
Whatever you ask,

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.840
my answer will always be:

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:27.910
"Yes, of course."

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.550
"You're always the best."

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.280
A spy from North Qi reports

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.960
that Zhao Yue

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.410
treats the Eldest Princess very well.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:42.380
He built her a palace
and gave her treasures.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.240
Where's the letter?

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.070
Let me see it.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.800
This letter

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.590
is confidential from the Arsenal Bureau.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.380
If you want to read it,

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.850
offer something in exchange.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:42.380
(To the Marquis of Zhenguo)

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:44.510
Zhao Yue is about to ascend
the throne in North Qi.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.370
Yunyang dislikes the Eldest Princess,

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.140
but with Zhao Yue's protection,

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.150
she has no choice.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.760
The spy said

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:58.320
they'll take good care of her.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:59.730
The Eldest Princess's temper

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.250
isn't something anyone can handle.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:04.510
Wei Yun,

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.330
she's done her best for Great Sui.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:07.960
We must bring her back safely.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.820
The weather is lovely today.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.320
How about we take Xiaoqi out

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.320
for a stroll someday?

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.680
Sure.

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:29.110
The spring of Great Sui
has finally arrived.

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.360
Winter has passed;

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:35.070
flowers are in bloom.
