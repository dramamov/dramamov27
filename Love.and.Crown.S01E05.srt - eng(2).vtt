LOVE & CROWN

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:31.025
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:34.025
EPISODE 5

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:51.305
Long live Your Majesty!

00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:54.225
Blessings upon Your Majesty!

00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:55.705
Father.

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:57.865
The imperial dignity must be upheld.

00:01:57.945 --> 00:01:59.185
Rituals cannot be neglected.

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:04.225
Sir, there's no need for such formality.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:06.705
Father,

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:08.465
when you bow to me like that,
I'm not used to it.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:09.744
So let's not.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.225
In time, you will get used to it.

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:20.585
Sir,

00:02:22.065 --> 00:02:24.465
is Luo Xianxue in the residence?

00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:27.825
He is. You wish to see him?

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:30.385
The Empress has been
worried about his injuries.

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:35.265
My dear, isn't that so?

00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:37.065
And if it is?

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:39.225
Would you even allow me to visit him?

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:41.185
As you wish.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.065
Your Majesty,

00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:14.425
she's been spoiled from childhood.

00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:16.265
I beg Your Majesty's pardon.

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:20.945
I've heard you excel at tea.

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:24.745
I wonder
if I might have the honor of a taste.

00:03:50.905 --> 00:03:51.905
Luo.

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:55.625
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.545
Are you blaming me?

00:04:02.785 --> 00:04:03.625
Of course not.

00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:05.945
Now, you're the Empress.

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:08.145
It's only right I bow to you.

00:04:09.105 --> 00:04:10.025
Rise.

00:04:18.705 --> 00:04:19.585
Your Majesty,

00:04:20.345 --> 00:04:22.625
it's just a scratch, not worth your worry.

00:04:25.025 --> 00:04:26.465
If you still see me as your little sister,

00:04:27.905 --> 00:04:29.305
stop calling me "Your Majesty".

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.225
If anyone's to blame,

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:38.225
it's me.

00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:41.025
Your Majesty, don't blame yourself.

00:04:42.105 --> 00:04:44.225
Your betrothal was set long ago.
You could never overrule him.

00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:45.385
He's the one at fault!

00:04:46.945 --> 00:04:48.505
He killed my master.

00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:50.025
But whatever the case,

00:04:50.785 --> 00:04:51.905
you're the Empress now.

00:04:57.585 --> 00:04:59.305
What exactly did he do to you?

00:05:00.985 --> 00:05:02.025
Before,

00:05:02.945 --> 00:05:04.145
I didn't know my place.

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:07.985
But now,

00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:10.465
I've thought it through.

00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:14.465
I know what I must do for everyone's good.

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:17.945
Our father grows older by the day.
He can't take upheaval.

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:19.625
Since you're Empress,

00:05:19.705 --> 00:05:21.865
you should consider
how to ease his burdens.

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:23.465
Ease Father's burdens?

00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:29.225
Yes. Empress Dowager Liu and Father
have long been at odds.

00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:31.265
Only by fulfilling your duty as Empress

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:32.745
can you truly ease his burdens.

00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:38.265
How am I supposed to do that?

00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:41.225
Every day I see him,

00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:45.065
I think of my master,
I think of your hand,

00:05:46.825 --> 00:05:48.225
and I could kill him with one stroke.

00:05:50.305 --> 00:05:52.665
Even if you won't think of Father,
think of yourself.

00:05:52.745 --> 00:05:54.385
Empress Dowager Liu
holds the Phoenix Seal.

00:05:54.465 --> 00:05:55.425
She rules the inner palace.

00:05:56.025 --> 00:05:58.145
Without His Majesty's favor,
without his support,

00:05:58.225 --> 00:05:59.625
how will you survive the inner palace?

00:06:00.785 --> 00:06:01.985
I'm speaking from the heart!

00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:11.625
Don't worry.

00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:15.065
I'll look after myself in the palace.

00:06:17.785 --> 00:06:18.665
Your Majesty…

00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:22.345
Rumors that the
Emperor and Empress are at odds

00:06:23.025 --> 00:06:24.265
are everywhere.

00:06:25.345 --> 00:06:27.545
The Empress Dowager
will surely use it and bully you.

00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:31.025
You must rely on His Majesty
and secure the Phoenix Seal.

00:06:31.105 --> 00:06:33.345
Then our father can be at ease.

00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:38.785
Please think twice, Your Majesty!

00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:43.265
Luo,

00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:48.145
may I ask you a favor?

00:06:50.225 --> 00:06:51.385
Your Majesty, just say the word.

00:06:54.345 --> 00:06:55.585
I want to set up

00:06:57.705 --> 00:06:58.825
a spirit tablet for my master.

00:06:59.465 --> 00:07:01.025
I knew Your Majesty would wish this.

00:07:02.025 --> 00:07:03.345
I've already sought a proper mausoleum.

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:06.465
All right.

00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:09.905
Thank you for seeing to it.

00:07:17.985 --> 00:07:20.505
Cangcang, take care.

00:07:28.825 --> 00:07:32.825
Two days ago, I obtained
some Wuyi Queshe Tea.

00:07:36.785 --> 00:07:39.785
Here. Please taste it, Your Majesty.

00:07:53.545 --> 00:07:56.185
A delicate fragrance
with a sweet, lingering finish.

00:07:56.265 --> 00:07:57.185
Fine tea.

00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:03.025
Today, Your Majesty
escorted the Empress home

00:08:03.105 --> 00:08:04.825
and now shares tea with me.

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:09.145
This old minister is truly gratified.

00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:10.665
Sir, do you know

00:08:10.745 --> 00:08:13.145
about the heretical sect
in the martial world,

00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:14.505
the Lingbi Sect?

00:08:15.145 --> 00:08:16.745
Backed by someone at court,

00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:19.825
they assassinate the powerful
and eliminate rivals.

00:08:21.785 --> 00:08:24.145
I am ill-informed
and have never heard of it.

00:08:26.585 --> 00:08:31.545
I have proof
that Li Lu is its secret leader,

00:08:32.585 --> 00:08:33.425
which makes

00:08:34.105 --> 00:08:38.505
your ties to the Lingbi Sect
hard to explain.

00:08:38.585 --> 00:08:40.904
I truly didn't know Li Lu's identity,

00:08:41.505 --> 00:08:43.904
only that he was a martial master

00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:46.665
who saved Cangcang
and taught her the sword.

00:08:46.745 --> 00:08:47.985
Nothing more.

00:08:57.785 --> 00:08:58.785
Nothing more…

00:08:59.865 --> 00:09:01.145
Then tell me,

00:09:01.825 --> 00:09:05.065
why did I cut off Luo Xianxue's finger?

00:09:06.625 --> 00:09:10.025
You don't think
it was just out of jealousy, do you?

00:09:12.465 --> 00:09:15.425
Your Majesty's care for the Empress

00:09:16.385 --> 00:09:17.905
is painstaking indeed.

00:09:18.505 --> 00:09:20.945
I'm deeply grateful.

00:09:28.265 --> 00:09:30.905
We're all family. No need for thanks.

00:09:32.545 --> 00:09:34.425
By the way, in a few days,

00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:36.465
the Ministry of Personnel will
propose a talent recommendation system.

00:09:36.545 --> 00:09:38.505
I consider it workable
and intend to implement it.

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:40.865
What say you, sir?

00:09:42.825 --> 00:09:44.825
If it benefits Great Qi,

00:09:45.425 --> 00:09:46.705
I will, of course,

00:09:47.945 --> 00:09:49.145
fully support it.

00:10:04.105 --> 00:10:06.545
Cangcang grew up away from strife

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:08.065
pure and kind at heart.

00:10:08.145 --> 00:10:09.985
So she loves and hates with all her being,

00:10:10.065 --> 00:10:11.705
and despises evil as her enemy.

00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:14.185
She's been willful for a dozen years,

00:10:14.265 --> 00:10:17.025
but now she's the Empress.

00:10:17.105 --> 00:10:19.105
It's time she grew up.

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:21.145
Have you said what must be said?

00:10:21.225 --> 00:10:22.185
Yes.

00:10:22.265 --> 00:10:24.785
As you instructed,
I told Young Lady everything.

00:10:26.185 --> 00:10:27.105
But Father,

00:10:27.945 --> 00:10:29.265
you know full well

00:10:29.345 --> 00:10:32.345
she still resents His Majesty
over Li Lu's death.

00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:35.545
Asking her to seek his favor
at a time like this, won't that…

00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:37.105
Xianxue,

00:10:37.945 --> 00:10:42.665
do you still think
I shouldn't have done this?

00:10:46.505 --> 00:10:48.665
I am Cangcang's father,

00:10:49.745 --> 00:10:52.705
and what I do
is certainly for her own good.

00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:58.905
His Majesty was born with cold poison.

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.905
Even the imperial
physicians can't treat it.

00:11:03.345 --> 00:11:05.105
What if he were to…

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:12.745
If Cangcang bears a prince soon,

00:11:13.825 --> 00:11:15.505
then she'll truly have real backing

00:11:15.585 --> 00:11:18.425
in the inner palace.

00:11:21.065 --> 00:11:22.385
Xianxue,

00:11:25.025 --> 00:11:27.065
this is the path she must take.

00:11:27.665 --> 00:11:28.865
All we can do

00:11:30.425 --> 00:11:31.625
is to pave the way for her,

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:34.385
so she walks steadier

00:11:35.705 --> 00:11:37.065
and goes farther.

00:11:40.545 --> 00:11:41.625
Understood.

00:11:43.065 --> 00:11:45.185
My lady asked me to find
a mausoleum to honor Li Lu.

00:11:46.585 --> 00:11:47.545
Promise her.

00:11:48.425 --> 00:11:49.425
But

00:11:50.025 --> 00:11:52.065
don't let her know

00:11:52.145 --> 00:11:54.465
that Li Lu was the Ghost King.

00:11:56.345 --> 00:11:57.345
But I don't think

00:11:57.985 --> 00:11:59.025
she will let it go easily.

00:12:01.985 --> 00:12:03.345
Try to talk her down.

00:12:04.545 --> 00:12:06.145
Cangcang is soft-hearted.

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:07.825
She'll always put the Ling family first.

00:12:08.625 --> 00:12:09.825
After all,

00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:13.265
we need to move on.

00:12:40.265 --> 00:12:43.425
YONGKANG MAUSOLEUM,
3 LI NORTH OF THE CAPITAL

00:12:58.865 --> 00:13:02.825
WUYING HALL

00:13:08.545 --> 00:13:09.585
Your Majesty.

00:13:10.465 --> 00:13:11.505
The Empress got a note by pigeon

00:13:11.585 --> 00:13:13.465
and slipped out of the palace.
You truly won't stop her?

00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:15.825
She'll come back.

00:13:17.145 --> 00:13:19.345
Keep me informed of her every move.

00:13:20.225 --> 00:13:21.305
Also,

00:13:21.905 --> 00:13:23.185
do not alert her.

00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:25.025
Understood.

00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:37.705
Master.

00:13:39.145 --> 00:13:40.105
I'm unfilial.

00:13:41.585 --> 00:13:43.825
I cannot pay respects
at your grave in person.

00:13:44.665 --> 00:13:45.905
I can only

00:13:48.705 --> 00:13:49.905
set up a spirit tablet for you here.

00:13:50.505 --> 00:13:52.025
SPIRIT TABLET OF THE LATE LI LU

00:13:52.105 --> 00:13:54.265
May it comfort your spirit in heaven.

00:14:01.065 --> 00:14:02.545
I brought you wine too.

00:14:07.185 --> 00:14:08.105
Though

00:14:08.825 --> 00:14:10.465
the Capital's wine is a bit light,

00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:12.865
and I'm not sure if you like it.

00:14:13.825 --> 00:14:14.785
Still,

00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:17.505
it's smooth and lingering.

00:14:18.665 --> 00:14:19.785
Please try it.

00:14:20.585 --> 00:14:23.105
SPIRIT TABLET OF THE LATE LI LU

00:14:36.865 --> 00:14:38.425
Let it go, Cangcang.

00:14:39.105 --> 00:14:42.025
Maybe His Majesty has his reasons.

00:14:45.545 --> 00:14:46.625
Reasons?

00:14:46.705 --> 00:14:49.345
What reason justifies
killing a man who kept to himself

00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:51.865
and did nothing but good?

00:14:58.145 --> 00:15:00.145
I roamed the martial world
with Master since I was little.

00:15:01.425 --> 00:15:02.825
He was unmatched in skill,

00:15:03.665 --> 00:15:05.185
almost without rival.

00:15:06.065 --> 00:15:08.665
Yet he was humble to all
and ever doing good.

00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:11.065
His only wish

00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:14.905
was that I grow up safe and happy.

00:15:15.865 --> 00:15:18.585
Master, I want those blossoms!

00:15:19.745 --> 00:15:22.225
All right. I'll pick them for you.

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:28.105
What are you doing?

00:15:33.865 --> 00:15:34.705
What do you think you're doing?

00:15:41.345 --> 00:15:43.185
Thank you. Thank you.

00:15:43.265 --> 00:15:44.105
Sorry to trouble you.

00:15:47.505 --> 00:15:49.465
Master, you're amazing!

00:15:50.585 --> 00:15:51.465
I can't make sense of it.

00:15:52.825 --> 00:15:54.225
What reason could justify

00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:57.945
killing a man so good,

00:15:58.025 --> 00:15:59.425
one he never spoke of?

00:16:00.185 --> 00:16:02.465
Cangcang, the dead can't return.

00:16:03.265 --> 00:16:05.185
-Look past it.
-Stop.

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:27.825
Show me your hand.

00:16:44.425 --> 00:16:45.265
Luo,

00:16:45.785 --> 00:16:47.225
you and Father

00:16:47.905 --> 00:16:50.905
are my closest family in this world.

00:16:52.465 --> 00:16:53.425
You're right.

00:16:54.545 --> 00:16:56.465
Since I'm the Empress now,

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:58.665
I should use that position

00:16:59.265 --> 00:17:00.265
to live well in the palace.

00:17:01.865 --> 00:17:03.785
So I can keep
everyone in the Ling family safe.

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:08.385
Cangcang, you've finally figured it out.

00:17:10.424 --> 00:17:11.305
Yes.

00:17:12.305 --> 00:17:13.704
I have.

00:17:14.745 --> 00:17:16.385
Until I learn the truth,

00:17:17.464 --> 00:17:19.105
I'll do my duty as Empress.

00:17:21.025 --> 00:17:22.105
Cangcang,

00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:25.745
-you still must find the truth?
-Right.

00:17:27.665 --> 00:17:29.585
Master's kindness to me runs deep.

00:17:30.105 --> 00:17:31.945
How could I let his death be in vain?

00:17:34.105 --> 00:17:36.745
But even if you uncover the truth,
what then?

00:17:44.465 --> 00:17:45.905
Then I'll repay every grudge

00:17:46.945 --> 00:17:48.145
and every grievance.

00:17:49.465 --> 00:17:50.665
I'll put an end to it all.

00:17:52.145 --> 00:17:53.625
The world will still be wide open.

00:18:00.745 --> 00:18:03.345
SPIRIT TABLET OF THE LATE LI LU

00:18:11.945 --> 00:18:14.065
-Your Majesty.
-Has the Empress returned?

00:18:14.145 --> 00:18:15.425
She has.

00:18:15.505 --> 00:18:17.585
She and Luo Xianxue visited a mausoleum

00:18:17.665 --> 00:18:18.825
and set up a spirit tablet for Li Lu.

00:18:18.905 --> 00:18:19.745
She just returned to Linghe Hall.

00:18:19.825 --> 00:18:21.065
She's in good spirits.

00:18:21.145 --> 00:18:22.905
Is that so? Good.

00:18:23.665 --> 00:18:26.625
Your Majesty,
why not tell Her Majesty the truth?

00:18:28.745 --> 00:18:30.265
Let her hate me

00:18:30.345 --> 00:18:32.825
is better than letting her learn it

00:18:32.905 --> 00:18:34.665
and suffer and grieve.

00:18:35.825 --> 00:18:38.585
Besides, the matter isn't over.

00:18:38.665 --> 00:18:41.265
-I don't want her dragged into it.
-Understood.

00:18:41.865 --> 00:18:43.825
How's the affair in Southern Chu
being handled?

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:45.705
Rest easy.

00:18:45.785 --> 00:18:47.225
Song Lanxi has agreed.

00:18:47.305 --> 00:18:48.265
He can depart for the Capital at any time.

00:18:49.185 --> 00:18:50.025
Good.

00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:52.425
We're rolling out the
talent recommendation system.

00:18:52.505 --> 00:18:54.105
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

00:18:54.985 --> 00:18:56.545
Ensure this pilot batch of candidates,

00:18:56.625 --> 00:18:58.105
especially Song Lanxi,

00:18:58.185 --> 00:18:59.705
arrives safely in the Capital.

00:19:00.345 --> 00:19:01.185
Understood.

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:04.345
LINGHE HALL

00:19:09.585 --> 00:19:10.705
Blessings upon Your Majesty.

00:19:15.225 --> 00:19:17.305
Why is it so cold in here?

00:19:19.305 --> 00:19:22.465
The steward eunuch says
our hall is short on attendants

00:19:23.065 --> 00:19:25.585
and His Majesty doesn't come,
so we don't get much charcoal.

00:19:28.465 --> 00:19:29.505
Is that so?

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:34.625
How long have I been in the palace now?

00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:37.265
Today makes seven days.

00:19:37.865 --> 00:19:38.905
Keep combing.

00:19:58.705 --> 00:20:00.545
With a touch of
grooming, Your Majesty is peerless.

00:20:00.625 --> 00:20:02.705
His Majesty will be
smitten when he sees you!

00:20:05.865 --> 00:20:06.705
We're not going to see His Majesty.

00:20:08.705 --> 00:20:09.785
Then who are we visiting?

00:20:10.505 --> 00:20:13.745
We're going to see the Empress Dowager
and reclaim what is ours.

00:20:14.345 --> 00:20:16.185
Do you mean the Phoenix Seal?

00:20:16.265 --> 00:20:18.505
If you go like this, it may be risky…

00:20:19.105 --> 00:20:20.025
We'll go anyway.

00:20:21.225 --> 00:20:22.145
Come on.

00:20:36.825 --> 00:20:37.905
Your Majesty.

00:20:39.025 --> 00:20:39.985
Aunt Chan.

00:20:40.065 --> 00:20:41.505
The Empress Dowager is napping.

00:20:41.585 --> 00:20:42.825
No one may enter and disturb her.

00:20:44.225 --> 00:20:46.585
Aunt Chan, I've heard Mother loves cheese.

00:20:46.665 --> 00:20:48.745
So I asked my brother

00:20:48.825 --> 00:20:52.385
to bring fine cheese back from Xijiang
for her to enjoy.

00:20:52.465 --> 00:20:54.785
It was sent on an
eight-hundred-li rush to the Capital.

00:20:54.865 --> 00:20:56.745
The flavor will change with time.

00:20:56.825 --> 00:20:58.425
Please announce me.

00:20:59.505 --> 00:21:01.185
Your Majesty is thoughtful.

00:21:01.265 --> 00:21:03.665
However, the Empress Dowager

00:21:03.745 --> 00:21:05.745
feels she's put on weight lately,

00:21:05.825 --> 00:21:07.265
and is on a fasting regimen.

00:21:07.345 --> 00:21:10.225
So I'm afraid
she won't partake of this cheese.

00:21:10.905 --> 00:21:11.865
I see.

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:16.385
What a pity.

00:21:18.505 --> 00:21:21.265
Then perhaps
I'll present it to you instead?

00:21:22.185 --> 00:21:24.145
Xiaoshan, take it in to Aunt Chan.

00:21:24.225 --> 00:21:25.145
Understood.

00:21:29.065 --> 00:21:30.745
The Empress Dowager is napping.

00:21:31.425 --> 00:21:34.385
No one may enter and disturb her.

00:21:38.105 --> 00:21:40.025
It's fine. We'll wait a bit longer.

00:21:40.705 --> 00:21:43.265
When the Empress Dowager wakes,
we'll go in then.

00:21:44.105 --> 00:21:45.745
Then please wait, Your Majesty.

00:21:46.945 --> 00:21:47.945
I'll go in and attend her.

00:21:49.345 --> 00:21:50.265
Hold.

00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:54.545
Since you're going in to serve,

00:21:55.145 --> 00:21:58.345
as her daughter-in-law,
I should go in to serve Mother as well

00:21:58.425 --> 00:21:59.305
to show my filial respect.

00:22:09.145 --> 00:22:10.705
The Empress's deportment is improper.

00:22:10.785 --> 00:22:11.825
How are you people attending her?

00:22:12.585 --> 00:22:14.905
Take them away.
Give them the forced-bend punishment

00:22:14.985 --> 00:22:15.945
for four hours!

00:22:19.985 --> 00:22:20.905
You dare strike me?

00:22:22.105 --> 00:22:23.545
I spoke kindly

00:22:23.625 --> 00:22:25.665
yet you threw your weight around
and ran roughshod.

00:22:26.225 --> 00:22:27.865
Am I not allowed to discipline you?

00:22:29.505 --> 00:22:31.585
Guards! Take her away.

00:22:31.665 --> 00:22:32.705
Understood!

00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:34.985
Your Majesty, at this rate…

00:22:35.065 --> 00:22:35.905
No hurry.

00:22:36.745 --> 00:22:37.785
Your Majesty.

00:22:39.585 --> 00:22:40.705
The Empress Dowager invites you.

00:22:44.745 --> 00:22:47.425
Then, I'll spare you for now.

00:23:02.305 --> 00:23:03.945
Greetings, Mother.

00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:09.025
You even struck my attendant.

00:23:09.665 --> 00:23:11.145
Quite the display of power.

00:23:13.785 --> 00:23:15.345
Mother, I am wronged!

00:23:16.065 --> 00:23:18.625
I came today to bring you cheese.

00:23:19.265 --> 00:23:20.385
But to my surprise,

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:23.185
Aunt Chan said you'd grown fat

00:23:23.265 --> 00:23:25.385
and must fast a few
days before seeing anyone.

00:23:28.545 --> 00:23:30.545
Your Majesty, don't heed this liar!

00:23:31.665 --> 00:23:32.825
When did I ever say that?

00:23:34.265 --> 00:23:35.225
Mother, you hear that?

00:23:36.145 --> 00:23:37.865
Aunt Chan calls me a liar.

00:23:39.505 --> 00:23:40.345
Aunt Chan,

00:23:40.425 --> 00:23:42.425
you've served Mother for years.

00:23:43.105 --> 00:23:44.625
I do respect you.

00:23:46.145 --> 00:23:48.305
But after all,
I am the Empress of Great Qi.

00:23:48.905 --> 00:23:52.705
Young as I am,
you shouldn't call me a liar.

00:23:54.545 --> 00:23:56.465
Your Majesty, I've been wronged!

00:23:56.545 --> 00:23:58.225
Please judge clearly!

00:23:59.865 --> 00:24:02.305
Since Aunt Chan misspoke,

00:24:02.385 --> 00:24:03.905
she should be slapped.

00:24:04.665 --> 00:24:06.265
Attend! Drag her out.

00:24:07.745 --> 00:24:09.825
Thank you for your
just judgment, Your Majesty.

00:24:16.585 --> 00:24:17.985
Are you satisfied now?

00:24:18.945 --> 00:24:21.425
You're fair in reward and punishment.
I take the lesson.

00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:23.665
Thank you, Mother.

00:24:24.465 --> 00:24:27.185
I've ruled the inner palace for decades.

00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:29.625
You mustn't be soft-hearted,

00:24:30.425 --> 00:24:33.505
or the wretches will walk over you.

00:24:34.545 --> 00:24:36.145
Don't you agree?

00:24:41.585 --> 00:24:42.865
You're absolutely right.

00:24:43.705 --> 00:24:46.985
Mother,
it's hard work to manage the harem,

00:24:47.585 --> 00:24:49.545
so I'd like to share the burden.

00:24:50.225 --> 00:24:53.625
Managing the inner
palace is the Empress's duty,

00:24:53.705 --> 00:24:55.265
mine to fulfill.

00:24:55.945 --> 00:24:58.465
-Why not grant me the Phoenix Seal…
-You've

00:25:00.105 --> 00:25:01.785
been in the palace seven days?

00:25:06.065 --> 00:25:06.905
Yes.

00:25:07.705 --> 00:25:11.825
By rights,
I should pass you the Phoenix Seal.

00:25:13.065 --> 00:25:15.425
But your conduct falls short,

00:25:17.105 --> 00:25:18.825
how can you rule the inner palace?

00:25:18.905 --> 00:25:20.825
What do you mean by that, Mother?

00:25:20.905 --> 00:25:22.225
Where have I failed my duties?

00:25:23.265 --> 00:25:24.905
I hear

00:25:24.985 --> 00:25:27.225
His Majesty has yet
to stay at Linghe Hall.

00:25:28.345 --> 00:25:29.625
As the Emperor's wife,

00:25:30.265 --> 00:25:32.065
you've not fulfilled a wife's duty.

00:25:32.145 --> 00:25:33.745
That is the gravest failing.

00:25:34.545 --> 00:25:36.385
An Empress's chief duty

00:25:36.465 --> 00:25:40.185
is to extend the royal line
and carry on the heirs.

00:25:41.105 --> 00:25:43.505
To be the mother of the realm,

00:25:44.705 --> 00:25:46.505
be a mother first.

00:25:49.185 --> 00:25:52.265
If you have no legitimate son or daughter,

00:25:53.465 --> 00:25:55.265
your throne

00:25:56.185 --> 00:25:58.025
will be hard to hold.

00:25:59.505 --> 00:26:01.625
I fear your mind is elsewhere.

00:26:02.225 --> 00:26:03.905
So for now,

00:26:04.745 --> 00:26:06.505
I'll shoulder these burdens.

00:26:08.265 --> 00:26:09.465
As for the Phoenix Seal,

00:26:10.265 --> 00:26:12.585
I'll keep it for you.

00:26:13.625 --> 00:26:16.465
When you've fulfilled an Empress's duties,

00:26:17.265 --> 00:26:19.145
I'll hand it over.

00:26:21.185 --> 00:26:22.465
I'm a bit tired.

00:26:22.545 --> 00:26:24.665
You may withdraw.

00:26:28.305 --> 00:26:29.305
Understood.

00:26:30.185 --> 00:26:31.185
I'll take my leave.

00:26:35.705 --> 00:26:36.905
I also hear

00:26:37.705 --> 00:26:39.545
the Emperor was just outside

00:26:40.745 --> 00:26:43.345
yet didn't speak up for you.

00:26:44.385 --> 00:26:47.625
As one who's been through it,
let me advise you:

00:26:48.345 --> 00:26:52.345
Reflect on yourself
and win back his favor.

00:27:14.625 --> 00:27:15.985
I still can't get around him.

00:27:16.585 --> 00:27:17.665
Mind your words, Your Majesty.

00:27:30.545 --> 00:27:32.425
-Your Majesty.
-How is the Empress?

00:27:33.145 --> 00:27:35.465
Since returning, all is normal.

00:27:35.545 --> 00:27:37.345
She showed no other strong reaction,

00:27:37.425 --> 00:27:39.825
only that
she took out a pear blossom hairpin.

00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:49.505
We're going to visit Master tomorrow.

00:27:49.585 --> 00:27:51.225
Why are you still up so late?

00:27:52.785 --> 00:27:53.625
Cangcang,

00:27:54.425 --> 00:27:55.945
I have a gift for you.

00:27:57.065 --> 00:27:57.905
What is it?

00:28:03.785 --> 00:28:05.185
What a beautiful hairpin!

00:28:06.425 --> 00:28:07.865
My home has a pear orchard,

00:28:07.945 --> 00:28:09.625
planted by my parents.

00:28:10.305 --> 00:28:11.425
When the blossoms are in full bloom,

00:28:11.985 --> 00:28:14.305
I'll take you there, all right?

00:28:18.105 --> 00:28:19.585
That depends on my master's permission.

00:28:22.065 --> 00:28:23.345
And if he says no?

00:28:24.745 --> 00:28:25.865
Then we won't go.

00:28:30.225 --> 00:28:31.985
Anyway, just put it on.

00:28:43.585 --> 00:28:44.425
Does it look good?

00:28:46.145 --> 00:28:47.305
It does.

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:35.305
Have the pear blossoms
in Qinyuan Garden bloomed?

00:29:35.385 --> 00:29:37.305
They've budded but not opened yet.

00:29:39.345 --> 00:29:41.705
I want to see a sea of
white blossoms like snow.

00:29:43.145 --> 00:29:44.945
Hongqing, see to it.

00:29:45.985 --> 00:29:46.985
Understood.

00:29:52.345 --> 00:29:53.945
-Put that over there.
-Yes, sir.

00:29:54.745 --> 00:29:55.865
Set this one here.

00:29:55.945 --> 00:29:57.225
Leave this here.

00:29:57.305 --> 00:29:58.665
Stoke the fire higher.

00:30:01.305 --> 00:30:03.785
You two, bring a few more braziers.

00:30:03.865 --> 00:30:04.865
Yes, sir!

00:30:06.425 --> 00:30:07.305
Commander Li.

00:30:08.145 --> 00:30:09.225
Eunuch Feng.

00:30:09.305 --> 00:30:13.345
Why so many braziers
throughout the garden?

00:30:13.425 --> 00:30:14.265
Are you

00:30:14.945 --> 00:30:17.865
building a warm frame
to force an early bloom?

00:30:17.945 --> 00:30:19.225
White as snow.

00:30:39.545 --> 00:30:40.425
Your Majesty, look!

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:41.745
The pear blossoms are all open.

00:30:41.825 --> 00:30:43.265
I didn't lie to you.

00:30:43.345 --> 00:30:44.185
They are.

00:30:44.785 --> 00:30:47.225
Not one was open days ago,

00:30:48.105 --> 00:30:49.145
and today the whole garden's in bloom.

00:30:52.065 --> 00:30:53.105
Do you like it?

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:55.625
Shall I cut two sprays for a vase?

00:31:01.705 --> 00:31:03.945
Here comes His Majesty!

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:08.425
If I can't secure the Phoenix Seal,

00:31:08.505 --> 00:31:11.185
never mind uncovering Master's death,

00:31:11.265 --> 00:31:13.145
I won't survive a day in the harem.

00:31:15.745 --> 00:31:16.705
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:31:18.785 --> 00:31:21.465
Do you like this garden of pear blossoms?

00:31:22.185 --> 00:31:23.425
I do.

00:31:23.505 --> 00:31:26.385
At first sight of them,
I thought of Your Majesty.

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:29.425
I meant to send for you,

00:31:29.505 --> 00:31:31.225
but you came at once.

00:31:31.305 --> 00:31:32.985
Are you here to admire them too?

00:31:35.065 --> 00:31:37.465
So, have you made up your mind?

00:31:39.865 --> 00:31:41.865
I have. Right now,

00:31:42.585 --> 00:31:44.225
I have made up my mind.

00:31:44.305 --> 00:31:45.905
We are husband and wife.

00:31:45.985 --> 00:31:47.785
I shouldn't hold resentment toward you.

00:31:48.585 --> 00:31:49.745
Your Majesty,

00:31:50.345 --> 00:31:52.025
at Linghe Hall,

00:31:52.705 --> 00:31:54.705
the nights are bitterly cold.

00:31:55.985 --> 00:31:58.265
Will you come keep me company tonight?

00:32:08.905 --> 00:32:10.505
Since when

00:32:10.585 --> 00:32:13.385
did I become a tool for you to toy with?

00:32:42.785 --> 00:32:43.625
Your Majesty,

00:32:43.705 --> 00:32:45.505
this is a new medicine
from the Imperial Preceptor

00:32:45.585 --> 00:32:47.545
to treat your cold sickness.

00:32:47.625 --> 00:32:49.745
What is it you painted, Your Majesty?

00:32:51.625 --> 00:32:54.145
Nothing, just a few casual strokes.

00:32:55.265 --> 00:32:57.905
I hear you viewed pear blossoms all day.

00:33:05.105 --> 00:33:06.345
This spring is chill.

00:33:06.425 --> 00:33:09.665
Their scent can affect the body.

00:33:11.425 --> 00:33:13.465
Beware a bout of wheezing.

00:33:14.505 --> 00:33:15.425
Hereafter,

00:33:17.225 --> 00:33:18.505
best avoid Qinyuan.

00:33:20.345 --> 00:33:23.265
I was born with the cold sickness.

00:33:23.945 --> 00:33:24.985
What has it to do with pear blossoms?

00:33:26.145 --> 00:33:27.465
I'm not that delicate.

00:33:28.425 --> 00:33:29.465
Fair point.

00:33:31.665 --> 00:33:33.145
The reform you seek

00:33:33.225 --> 00:33:35.305
will shake the nobles' interests.

00:33:36.025 --> 00:33:36.945
I fear

00:33:38.425 --> 00:33:39.585
Grand Tutor Ling won't support it.

00:33:41.385 --> 00:33:44.425
In court, only Minister Xing

00:33:44.505 --> 00:33:45.785
can counter him.

00:33:46.385 --> 00:33:48.105
Though he's of the Empress Dowager's line,

00:33:49.585 --> 00:33:50.825
there's room to win him over.

00:33:56.105 --> 00:33:57.465
I hear

00:33:57.545 --> 00:33:59.665
Minister Xing has a beloved daughter.

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:01.505
If Your Majesty

00:34:02.185 --> 00:34:03.945
takes her as a consort,

00:34:04.905 --> 00:34:06.905
-he'll surely serve you.
-Madam…

00:34:06.985 --> 00:34:08.304
Your Majesty, remember:

00:34:09.025 --> 00:34:10.385
you married the Empress

00:34:10.465 --> 00:34:11.665
to counter Grand Tutor Ling.

00:34:11.744 --> 00:34:13.304
Now, to keep the balance,

00:34:14.344 --> 00:34:16.425
taking Minister Xing's daughter

00:34:16.505 --> 00:34:17.545
is just as necessary.

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:23.465
My harem requires no concern from you.

00:34:29.225 --> 00:34:30.625
I overstepped.

00:34:30.705 --> 00:34:34.505
As Imperial Preceptor,
you should not dabble in such affairs.

00:34:34.585 --> 00:34:37.705
Your Majesty,
the Empress may not be your foe,

00:34:40.505 --> 00:34:41.945
but she cannot be your soft spot.

00:35:33.185 --> 00:35:35.425
Your Majesty, it's late.

00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:36.505
Let's give up waiting.

00:35:37.385 --> 00:35:39.665
What do you think
His Majesty is doing now?

00:35:42.985 --> 00:35:44.705
I asked around.

00:35:45.225 --> 00:35:47.905
His Majesty
has been reading memorials at Wuying Hall

00:35:48.545 --> 00:35:49.665
and went nowhere else.

00:35:53.225 --> 00:35:55.065
Enough. Let's go rest.

00:35:55.665 --> 00:35:57.105
Understood.

00:35:59.985 --> 00:36:00.865
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:36:34.585 --> 00:36:35.425
Right now,

00:36:36.145 --> 00:36:37.825
I have made up my mind.

00:36:37.905 --> 00:36:39.305
We are husband and wife.

00:36:39.385 --> 00:36:41.505
I shouldn't hold resentment toward you.

00:36:42.185 --> 00:36:43.785
At Linghe Hall,

00:36:44.425 --> 00:36:46.465
nights are bitterly cold.

00:36:47.745 --> 00:36:50.025
Will you come keep me company tonight?

00:36:59.585 --> 00:37:02.065
Your Majesty, your health comes first.

00:37:02.745 --> 00:37:03.945
Shall we retire?

00:37:05.905 --> 00:37:06.865
No need.

00:37:13.025 --> 00:37:14.065
Your Majesty,

00:37:15.225 --> 00:37:17.105
you're holding the memorial upside down.

00:37:40.745 --> 00:37:44.265
None of you
supports the talent recommendation system?

00:37:46.265 --> 00:37:49.585
If you have thoughts, speak freely.

00:37:50.305 --> 00:37:51.425
The new system makes sense,

00:37:51.505 --> 00:37:53.505
but it will be hard to carry out.

00:37:53.585 --> 00:37:54.905
With the Grand Tutor silent,

00:37:54.985 --> 00:37:56.505
we dare not say much.

00:37:56.585 --> 00:37:57.745
-Yes.
-Exactly.

00:37:57.825 --> 00:37:58.985
Reasonable.

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:08.265
Your Majesty,

00:38:08.345 --> 00:38:11.945
the system selects
talent beyond old rules.

00:38:12.025 --> 00:38:14.465
But scholars vary by region.

00:38:14.545 --> 00:38:17.785
Bringing them to court rashly
may be unwise.

00:38:17.865 --> 00:38:19.705
The Grand Tutor never proposed it before.

00:38:19.785 --> 00:38:21.665
Best to see where he stands now.

00:38:21.745 --> 00:38:22.865
That's sensible.

00:38:22.945 --> 00:38:24.505
Not so. A matter this big

00:38:24.585 --> 00:38:26.625
can't be decided in a moment.

00:38:31.545 --> 00:38:33.505
By the way, in a few days,

00:38:33.585 --> 00:38:35.025
the Ministry of Personnel will
propose a talent recommendation system.

00:38:35.705 --> 00:38:37.585
I consider it workable
and intend to implement it.

00:38:38.865 --> 00:38:39.945
What say you, Sir?

00:38:41.905 --> 00:38:43.905
If it benefits Great Qi,

00:38:44.505 --> 00:38:45.865
I will, of course,

00:38:47.025 --> 00:38:48.425
fully support it.

00:38:50.385 --> 00:38:51.265
Your Majesty,

00:38:51.905 --> 00:38:53.345
no one in court supports the system.

00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:55.745
What now?

00:38:57.305 --> 00:39:00.145
I expected today's pushback

00:39:00.225 --> 00:39:01.545
and have a plan.

00:39:02.345 --> 00:39:04.505
-Hold for now.
-Understood.

00:39:05.585 --> 00:39:06.505
Time to go to Nanrong Palace now.

00:39:08.185 --> 00:39:09.185
Get my medicine.

00:39:10.505 --> 00:39:11.345
Understood.

00:39:14.625 --> 00:39:15.945
Your Majesty,

00:39:16.025 --> 00:39:17.785
the Empress waited all night

00:39:17.865 --> 00:39:19.065
and just fell asleep.

00:39:19.985 --> 00:39:21.465
-Wufu.
-Here.

00:39:21.545 --> 00:39:22.705
Find a way

00:39:22.785 --> 00:39:24.425
to move the spies from her side.

00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:26.745
Understood.

00:39:36.545 --> 00:39:37.465
Madam,

00:39:38.385 --> 00:39:39.585
are the elixirs ready?

00:39:46.345 --> 00:39:50.265
Commander Li,
why are you here alone today?

00:39:50.345 --> 00:39:52.865
Doesn't His Majesty
always stop by after court?

00:39:53.505 --> 00:39:55.105
He went to Linghe Hall today.

00:39:59.345 --> 00:40:01.945
This batch has new herbs added.

00:40:03.025 --> 00:40:04.025
When His Majesty takes it,

00:40:04.105 --> 00:40:07.625
I must be present
to take his pulse and observe.

00:40:11.545 --> 00:40:12.385
This time,

00:40:13.105 --> 00:40:14.545
let me deliver it.

00:40:14.625 --> 00:40:15.945
Please don't put me in a bind.

00:40:19.665 --> 00:40:22.025
Xiaoyue! Xiaoyue!

00:40:23.505 --> 00:40:24.545
Quiet down.

00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:26.705
Her Majesty was up all night
and just fell asleep.

00:40:27.705 --> 00:40:30.505
Xiaoyue, Eunuch Yang from the
Household asks for you.

00:40:30.585 --> 00:40:31.585
Me?

00:40:31.665 --> 00:40:33.585
Yes, go on. They're waiting.

00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:37.065
-Xiaoshan, I'll be right back.
-All right.

00:40:43.625 --> 00:40:45.585
His Majesty said he wouldn't come.

00:40:45.665 --> 00:40:47.185
Why lose sleep waiting?

00:40:47.265 --> 00:40:48.785
What's the point?

00:40:51.065 --> 00:40:52.105
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:26.905
Cangcang,

00:41:28.105 --> 00:41:29.305
I'm truly sorry.

00:41:31.345 --> 00:41:33.105
But if you knew the truth,

00:41:33.625 --> 00:41:35.625
how would you face your master?

00:41:37.985 --> 00:41:39.625
And how could you bear it?

00:41:43.425 --> 00:41:44.465
Your Majesty!

00:41:52.985 --> 00:41:54.105
You finally came.

00:41:55.385 --> 00:41:57.545
I was just passing by and looking in.

00:41:58.145 --> 00:42:01.025
I didn't expect
you'd be sleeping in broad daylight.

00:42:01.105 --> 00:42:02.265
What conduct is that?

00:42:04.785 --> 00:42:07.145
Since you're here,
stay and keep me company.

00:42:08.425 --> 00:42:09.825
I still have matters to attend to.

00:42:09.905 --> 00:42:12.065
If you wish to sleep, then sleep.

00:42:12.745 --> 00:42:14.265
Do you dislike me so much?

00:42:14.345 --> 00:42:15.305
You won't spare me a glance?

00:42:22.745 --> 00:42:25.425
Why do you want me to stay?

00:42:27.865 --> 00:42:30.265
Do you remember this pear blossom hairpin?

00:42:32.745 --> 00:42:34.865
If you don't like it, throw it away.

00:42:34.945 --> 00:42:37.225
I like it! Put it on me.

00:42:43.705 --> 00:42:44.625
If not,

00:42:45.585 --> 00:42:47.225
share a drink with me. Just one cup.

00:42:47.825 --> 00:42:50.345
After this cup, we're back to how we were.

00:42:51.265 --> 00:42:52.105
All right?
