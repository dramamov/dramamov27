DYNAMITE KISS

00:00:59.998 --> 00:01:02.041
Hello, Ms. Go. Good morning.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:03.459
-Good morning, Ms. Go.
-Ms. Go.

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:05.003
Here is this week's schedule.

00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:06.296
-Thanks.
-Ma'am…

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:07.630
-Yes, that's right.
-Could you approve this?

00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:09.090
I'll review it all upstairs.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:17.473
CEO GO DA-RIM

00:01:17.557 --> 00:01:19.309
Mondays, as always, are so challenging.

00:01:20.226 --> 00:01:21.060
Okay.

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:49.255
Okay.

00:01:54.302 --> 00:01:56.054
And what is this?

00:02:03.853 --> 00:02:07.357
Okay. I accept this proposal.

00:02:23.498 --> 00:02:26.709
Hold on. What did you say
your name was again, Newbie?

00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:28.419
My name is…

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.588
My name is…

00:02:31.923 --> 00:02:32.799
Noryangjin.

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.551
It is Noryangjin.

00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:41.557
-Noryangjin.
-This stop is Noryangjin Station.

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:53.778
This stop is Noryangjin Station.

00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:57.865
Sorry. Please hold the door.

00:02:58.908 --> 00:03:03.830
DYNAMITE KISS

00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:05.873
EPISODE 1

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.192
Careful. You're okay here. Take your time.

00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:39.073
There you go.

00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:44.704
Excuse me.

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:45.788
NORYANGJIN VICTORY ACADEMY

00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:49.042
"Number two describes
decision-making in a highly cohesive,

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.419
yet chaotic organization."

00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:53.087
Incorrect. "Problematic preferences arise

00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:56.382
because the causal links
between goals and means remain unclear."

00:03:57.216 --> 00:03:59.677
Seriously?
Are you all really dozing off right now?

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:02.055
Just look at Ms. Go Da-rim here.

00:04:02.638 --> 00:04:03.514
Me?

00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:08.144
I have never once seen Ms. Go Da-rim
fall asleep in my lecture.

00:04:09.812 --> 00:04:12.273
Even when you pour
your heart into studying for it,

00:04:12.357 --> 00:04:15.234
this exam could still squander away
five years of your life.

00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:17.236
"Squander away" sounds a bit…

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.821
"Veteran examinee" is sugarcoating it.

00:04:18.905 --> 00:04:21.866
You're in your thirties now.
You're basically a Noryangjin zombie now.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.577
Do you want to grow old like this zombie?

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.495
-No.
-No.

00:04:25.578 --> 00:04:27.080
-You don't, right?
-Right.

00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:28.331
Now, let's resume.

00:04:28.414 --> 00:04:30.625
It did come off a bit harsh, but…

00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:31.542
That will be covered in tomorrow's class.

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:33.211
-See you then.
-Okay.

00:04:33.294 --> 00:04:35.213
-All right.
-Excuse me, sir?

00:04:35.296 --> 00:04:36.672
If it isn't our model student.

00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:39.050
I feel like you crossed a line
with me earlier.

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:41.219
-What do you mean?
-"Noryangjin Zombie"?

00:04:41.302 --> 00:04:45.139
You belittled my 30-year existence
and my 5 years of exam prep.

00:04:45.223 --> 00:04:46.557
It was all in good fun.

00:04:46.641 --> 00:04:49.519
You may have made a joke for fun,
but the poor target may feel--

00:04:49.602 --> 00:04:51.437
All right, I hear you.

00:04:52.105 --> 00:04:53.815
Let me give you this, then. Here.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.818
This is just unbelievable.

00:04:56.901 --> 00:04:57.777
What?

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.821
Did you think this would make me go…

00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:02.865
Thank you so much.
My sincerest thanks, sir.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.743
-Are we good now?
-Of course.

00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:08.830
Zombie, goblin, vampire.
Call me whatever you wish.

00:05:09.414 --> 00:05:10.706
-See you tomorrow.
-Take care.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:11.666
All right, bye.

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:14.502
Oh, hey.

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:17.547
How can you be so unfazed
after hearing all that?

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.591
Who cares? Being called a zombie
got me a free month of lectures.

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:21.926
Do you even know

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.345
how many days I have to work here
to earn the equivalent?

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:27.265
Is this what my thirties will be like?

00:05:27.348 --> 00:05:29.350
That's more reason for you
to pass that test as soon as possible.

00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:32.145
If you continue living like this
well over your thirties,

00:05:32.228 --> 00:05:34.147
your very existence
becomes a nuisance to others.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.148
Just dead weight.

00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:37.942
But at least you do well
on the written exams.

00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:39.360
You just need to do well
on the interviews…

00:05:40.862 --> 00:05:42.238
Da-rim.

00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:43.823
You're usually so well-spoken,

00:05:43.906 --> 00:05:45.575
so why do you keep failing interviews?

00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:49.370
I know, right?

00:06:11.767 --> 00:06:12.810
Five years ago,

00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:15.980
I was defeated in the war for employment

00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:18.608
and fled to Noryangjin.

00:06:20.234 --> 00:06:22.111
I decided to flee from the biting remarks

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:25.114
and the judgmental gaze of others

00:06:26.073 --> 00:06:28.534
to hide behind
the "civil-service examinee" identity.

00:06:29.118 --> 00:06:29.952
However,

00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:33.331
after repeatedly failing
the civil service exam,

00:06:33.998 --> 00:06:36.500
I have nowhere to hide anymore.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.378
How much longer can I keep this up?

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:44.592
Until when will I live like a zombie,
neither alive nor dead?

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.428
How much longer can I go on?

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.073
Mom, Da-jeong.

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:08.783
Can you take a look at my new clothes?

00:07:08.866 --> 00:07:09.825
Clothes?

00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:12.411
You bought clothes?

00:07:13.663 --> 00:07:16.916
It's not like I can wear sweats
to her wedding.

00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:19.001
Take a look.

00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:22.380
-Hold on, Da-rim.
-What?

00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:28.302
-This is for you.
-What's this?

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:32.598
A ticket to Jeju Island?

00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:34.267
And a hotel voucher?

00:07:36.227 --> 00:07:37.353
Go Da-jeong.

00:07:37.436 --> 00:07:39.522
I guess you felt bad about getting married

00:07:39.605 --> 00:07:41.274
before your older sister.

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:44.902
Let's see here.

00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:49.240
I see. I'll be gone for 4 days
from the 6th to the 9th.

00:07:52.618 --> 00:07:55.329
Wait, but your wedding is on the 8th.

00:07:55.413 --> 00:07:56.872
The thing is…

00:07:56.956 --> 00:07:59.875
My in-laws believe

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:02.837
that you're working in the US.

00:08:03.671 --> 00:08:05.006
Who knows who will show up that day

00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:08.676
and ask you random questions
that might expose that lie?

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:10.511
It just sort of happened, you know.

00:08:11.178 --> 00:08:13.139
Yeah, I wonder why I did that.

00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:17.518
I'm sorry.

00:08:17.602 --> 00:08:19.645
Yeah, why did you even lie?

00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:21.522
She's your one and only sister.

00:08:21.606 --> 00:08:25.151
How can you possibly tell her
not to come to your wedding?

00:08:25.234 --> 00:08:26.152
Look up there.

00:08:26.235 --> 00:08:28.195
Don't you see
our family motto hanging proudly?

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:30.906
Your dad must be
turning in his grave right now.

00:08:31.574 --> 00:08:32.783
What am I supposed to do then?

00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:35.911
My fiancé graduated from a top-tier school
and works at a major corporation,

00:08:35.995 --> 00:08:37.330
while I went to a regional university
and work at a small company.

00:08:37.413 --> 00:08:39.040
My mother-in-law doesn't approve of me.

00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:43.919
I'm drowning as it is,
and you want me to add on?

00:08:44.003 --> 00:08:47.381
"Mother, you see,
my older sister is actually unemployed."

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.593
How could I say that?

00:08:51.677 --> 00:08:55.389
I'm just telling you
how upset I am about the situation.

00:08:58.267 --> 00:08:59.477
Amazing.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.520
Daiabeach Hotel.

00:09:01.604 --> 00:09:04.065
Don't they throw pool parties
at night and stuff?

00:09:06.025 --> 00:09:07.068
Thank you, dear sister.

00:09:07.151 --> 00:09:09.028
I get to experience such luxury
thanks to you.

00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:10.321
You're going?

00:09:10.404 --> 00:09:13.282
Let's be real. It's a celebration for her,
but just torture for me.

00:09:13.366 --> 00:09:15.951
See? She likes the idea too.

00:09:16.035 --> 00:09:19.413
But don't tell me
this is all you're going to cover.

00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:21.791
Food, transportation,
and travel expenses. Deal?

00:09:21.874 --> 00:09:23.334
-Deal.
-Excellent.

00:09:23.417 --> 00:09:25.002
See you later.

00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:26.253
Awesome!

00:09:29.632 --> 00:09:30.633
Seriously?

00:09:32.218 --> 00:09:34.804
Let us go

00:09:34.887 --> 00:09:36.639
Just the two of us

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.602
And leave all of it behind

00:09:42.353 --> 00:09:46.315
For the blue night of Jeju Island

00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:49.527
Underneath the stars

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.237
Don't you even feel bad for her?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.407
She didn't even buy me a fridge
or a measly rice cooker for my wedding.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.618
This is the only way
she can actually help me right now.

00:09:57.702 --> 00:10:00.371
This all just upsets me.

00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:02.665
The only family we have is each other.

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:05.584
If you

00:10:06.293 --> 00:10:10.673
Find yourself being lonely…

00:10:47.084 --> 00:10:49.128
That's right. And one more thing.

00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:51.756
Ji-hyeok, I would like to buy you as well.

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:52.673
How much?

00:10:52.757 --> 00:10:53.841
Please leave me out of it.

00:10:54.633 --> 00:11:00.014
There are still plenty of startups here
with potential that require my attention.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.335
Five times!

00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:36.008
Thank you, ma'am.

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:41.597
That should be enough to expand
the production facilities immediately.

00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:43.098
Thank you.

00:11:44.808 --> 00:11:45.935
Ten times.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.854
No way.

00:11:55.444 --> 00:11:56.362
What…

00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:01.575
Could you repeat that, Mr. Hassan?

00:12:01.659 --> 00:12:02.993
Ten times.

00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:16.215
It's unbelievable how smoothly you pushed
this project through in just six months.

00:12:16.298 --> 00:12:18.551
I'm quite impressed, Mr. Gong.

00:12:18.634 --> 00:12:20.844
Will you allow me to set
one more condition?

00:12:21.428 --> 00:12:23.264
Of course.

00:12:23.347 --> 00:12:25.975
I'd appreciate you
recruiting Kim Jeong-gwon,

00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:28.811
who has proven to be
the most competent developer in Korea.

00:12:30.229 --> 00:12:31.438
Kim Jeong-gwon, huh?

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:34.900
Most certainly.

00:12:34.984 --> 00:12:35.985
Thank you.

00:12:36.652 --> 00:12:37.570
I appreciate it.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.582
Ten times!

00:12:49.665 --> 00:12:52.459
Ten times the asking price!

00:12:53.294 --> 00:12:54.587
That's my bro!

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.673
I mean… Well done, Mr. Gong.

00:12:57.756 --> 00:12:58.674
Thanks, Gyeong-min.

00:13:00.884 --> 00:13:01.719
Good job.

00:13:03.554 --> 00:13:06.599
We'd better secure Kim Jeong-gwon
before Hassan changes his mind.

00:13:06.682 --> 00:13:08.726
Wait, stop right there.

00:13:08.809 --> 00:13:11.103
This calls for a celebratory drink,
don't you think?

00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:27.119
-Want to hang?
-No.

00:13:27.202 --> 00:13:28.162
Okay!

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:29.955
Want to hang?

00:13:30.039 --> 00:13:31.457
-No.
-Okay!

00:13:37.796 --> 00:13:38.881
Want to hang?

00:13:38.964 --> 00:13:40.883
-No, thanks.
-Okay!

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.554
Hello again.

00:13:45.638 --> 00:13:48.223
Listen. Do you see that dude over there?

00:13:48.307 --> 00:13:50.142
The tall man in the gray suit.

00:13:50.934 --> 00:13:53.145
We came together. I'm not alone.

00:13:53.228 --> 00:13:54.855
You two are just so beautiful.

00:13:54.938 --> 00:13:56.565
If you're free,

00:13:56.649 --> 00:13:58.901
how about having a drink
with the two of…

00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:02.571
Excuse me for a sec.

00:14:02.655 --> 00:14:03.530
Hey!

00:14:04.156 --> 00:14:06.200
Must you act like this?

00:14:06.283 --> 00:14:08.327
Why can't we have some fun
and drink together?

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.246
And who knows?
That could lead to dating and more.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.956
I can't be bothered. It's too tedious.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.833
I can't believe you.

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:16.627
How can you find love tedious?

00:14:18.504 --> 00:14:22.675
Do you know what dies faster
than the head of your beer?

00:14:23.842 --> 00:14:25.970
Love. Got that?

00:14:26.053 --> 00:14:30.307
That's because
you never go beyond the superficial.

00:14:30.391 --> 00:14:32.101
It has to come from deep within.

00:14:32.184 --> 00:14:35.896
You need to take your time
to give and take.

00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:38.148
Vibe together, you know?

00:14:38.232 --> 00:14:39.191
What vibe?

00:14:39.274 --> 00:14:42.486
A fateful encounter
followed by instinctive attraction.

00:14:42.569 --> 00:14:44.196
Two souls become one,

00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:46.448
and they become entangled and explode.

00:14:47.032 --> 00:14:49.284
I guess you can call it
a chemical reaction.

00:14:49.368 --> 00:14:51.495
Chemistry, my ass.

00:14:51.578 --> 00:14:52.913
Humans aren't like H2O.

00:14:52.997 --> 00:14:56.250
Do you think we're like atoms dependent
on each other to create water?

00:14:57.835 --> 00:15:00.421
Humans are independent life forms.

00:15:01.338 --> 00:15:03.716
They're at peak perfection
when they live alone.

00:15:10.556 --> 00:15:11.890
Be honest.

00:15:11.974 --> 00:15:14.268
You've never experienced a kiss
that blew your mind, have you?

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.729
No, I haven't.

00:15:16.812 --> 00:15:18.522
Then have you ever met someone
you couldn't bear to leave?

00:15:18.605 --> 00:15:19.940
Someone you want to hold,

00:15:20.024 --> 00:15:22.234
or who makes you go crazy
when you can't see them?

00:15:22.317 --> 00:15:23.277
Not really.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.195
See? I knew it.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:28.282
You're like this
because you haven't met the one yet.

00:15:28.365 --> 00:15:30.576
That's a crucial life experience.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.661
You need to ditch this fantasy

00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:35.122
of fateful encounters
and instinctive attraction.

00:15:35.205 --> 00:15:36.749
You're way too old for that.

00:15:36.832 --> 00:15:38.375
-Let's drink.
-I didn't bring mine.

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:41.962
Okay!

00:15:58.312 --> 00:16:01.440
You come from a chaebol family,
yet you always show up empty-handed.

00:16:02.316 --> 00:16:03.442
You also come from a chaebol family,

00:16:03.525 --> 00:16:05.569
yet you don't offer your guest
a glass of water.

00:16:05.652 --> 00:16:08.072
Your hands work fine.
Go and get it yourself.

00:16:08.155 --> 00:16:08.989
I didn't come empty-handed.

00:16:11.116 --> 00:16:13.744
I have good news and even better news.

00:16:13.827 --> 00:16:14.870
Which one do you want to hear first?

00:16:14.953 --> 00:16:15.996
Whichever.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.414
Let's start with the good news.

00:16:18.373 --> 00:16:19.374
We're getting married.

00:16:22.002 --> 00:16:22.836
What?

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:26.131
I heard your father proposed it first.

00:16:26.215 --> 00:16:27.883
They're working out the terms now.

00:16:31.345 --> 00:16:34.515
You'd better make this clear
to Chairman Yu.

00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:37.726
I have no desire to get married.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.062
But I do.

00:16:41.021 --> 00:16:43.732
Ha-yeong, do you think marriage
is some sort of mating retreat?

00:16:43.816 --> 00:16:45.192
You think you just pair up
when someone tells you to?

00:16:45.275 --> 00:16:47.069
-At the very least…
-"At the very least"?

00:16:50.239 --> 00:16:51.907
We should be vibing at the very least.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.535
How are you so sure we won't?

00:16:54.618 --> 00:16:56.078
Don't we need to

00:16:56.161 --> 00:16:58.288
at least kiss to know for sure?

00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:00.541
I've always wanted to,

00:17:00.624 --> 00:17:01.667
you know?

00:17:16.098 --> 00:17:17.307
I've been wanting to say this

00:17:18.934 --> 00:17:20.394
ever since you came in.

00:17:22.563 --> 00:17:23.730
This shade of lipstick

00:17:23.814 --> 00:17:24.898
doesn't suit you at all.

00:17:26.066 --> 00:17:28.485
Maybe try something lighter,
like a coral shade.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:32.656
As an art school grad, shouldn't you
at least know which colors complement you?

00:17:34.783 --> 00:17:37.119
We can confirm that next time.
Here's the even better news--

00:17:37.202 --> 00:17:38.745
Stop that. You're scaring me.

00:17:39.705 --> 00:17:41.999
I don't believe in
abstinence before marriage.

00:17:42.082 --> 00:17:44.960
-Just letting you know.
-Leave. Go home. Get out of here now.

00:17:57.055 --> 00:17:57.973
Hey.

00:17:58.056 --> 00:17:58.974
Hi.

00:17:59.641 --> 00:18:01.310
-Are those side dishes?
-Yeah.

00:18:01.393 --> 00:18:03.270
-For whom?
-Jun.

00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:05.063
Come on up.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.858
Really?

00:18:08.525 --> 00:18:12.362
Da-jeong can't do that to you.
You were always there for her.

00:18:12.446 --> 00:18:13.989
That rotten brat.

00:18:14.072 --> 00:18:15.949
Who hasn't been to Jeju?

00:18:17.409 --> 00:18:18.577
You've never been.

00:18:19.077 --> 00:18:19.912
That's true.

00:18:19.995 --> 00:18:21.038
Seriously?

00:18:21.705 --> 00:18:23.373
But is Jeju nice?

00:18:23.457 --> 00:18:25.167
I mean, yeah, it is.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.419
Really? Have you been? When?

00:18:27.502 --> 00:18:29.504
For my honeymoon.

00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:33.008
-Sorry.
-It's fine. It was forever ago.

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:36.428
-Hey, son.
-Good morning.

00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:38.722
Jun, did you sleep well?

00:18:38.805 --> 00:18:39.890
Come here. It's time for probiotics.

00:18:41.808 --> 00:18:44.978
Jun! How are you so handsome
in the morning?

00:18:45.562 --> 00:18:47.022
You're like an adorable little chick!

00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:48.315
You smell like an old man.

00:18:48.398 --> 00:18:49.858
Where are you going?

00:18:54.238 --> 00:18:56.073
I used to be popular in my youth.

00:18:56.156 --> 00:18:58.325
When? When you used to date
Kim Jeong-gwon?

00:18:59.326 --> 00:19:01.078
The next time you mention that name again,

00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:03.080
it'll be your funeral and mine.

00:19:04.414 --> 00:19:05.582
Sorry.

00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:08.085
You made the right call
breaking up with him.

00:19:08.168 --> 00:19:10.796
-He was so obnoxious.
-Of course it was.

00:19:11.922 --> 00:19:13.006
But…

00:19:13.966 --> 00:19:17.302
what if he's the last guy
I kissed before I die?

00:19:17.386 --> 00:19:18.929
What do I do then?

00:19:19.012 --> 00:19:22.140
How can you already be worried
about "lasts" at your age?

00:19:23.684 --> 00:19:27.646
Maybe you should pick up
a new boyfriend while you're in Jeju.

00:19:27.729 --> 00:19:29.398
Forget it.

00:19:29.481 --> 00:19:31.525
No man would want an exiled woman.

00:19:33.068 --> 00:19:34.361
I'm off. Thanks for this.

00:19:34.444 --> 00:19:36.446
-Okay. Bye.
-I'll return this later.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.489
Sure.

00:19:52.462 --> 00:19:56.008
A guest lecture with Kim Jeong-gwon,
the best AI programmer in Korea.

00:20:02.347 --> 00:20:03.598
Kim Jeong-gwon?

00:20:04.224 --> 00:20:05.309
A GUEST LECTURE WITH KIM JEONG-GWON,
THE BEST AI PROGRAMMER IN KOREA!

00:20:12.566 --> 00:20:15.110
Babe, you know our first anniversary
is coming up, right?

00:20:15.193 --> 00:20:18.071
So I saved my wages and bought something.
Don't be too shocked.

00:20:20.073 --> 00:20:21.158
Ta-da!

00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:22.534
Tickets to Jeju Island.

00:20:22.617 --> 00:20:23.702
-Go Da-rim.
-Yeah?

00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:25.412
Do you think you can afford
to celebrate anniversaries right now?

00:20:25.495 --> 00:20:26.496
What?

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.707
You quit the job hunt and failed the exam.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.710
You're doing nothing but killing time.

00:20:32.252 --> 00:20:33.086
Jeong-gwon.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.629
It's pitiful and frustrating.

00:20:34.713 --> 00:20:37.841
Being subtle didn't work,
so I'll just come out and say it.

00:20:37.924 --> 00:20:39.051
Let's break up.

00:20:42.763 --> 00:20:44.014
Come on, don't do this.

00:20:44.723 --> 00:20:47.184
You said you liked me.
No, you said you loved me.

00:20:47.267 --> 00:20:49.686
Yeah, I did like you.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.313
I liked how bright and cute you were.

00:20:51.396 --> 00:20:54.358
But it turns out
I mistook hopeless as bright

00:20:54.441 --> 00:20:57.194
and immature as cute.

00:20:57.277 --> 00:21:00.197
Just look at yourself right now.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.201
You look like
a limp piece of over-blanched spinach.

00:21:04.826 --> 00:21:07.871
No man in this world wants to date
an over-blanched piece of spinach.

00:21:09.164 --> 00:21:10.165
Jeong-gwon…

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.885
Over-blanched piece of spinach? As if…

00:21:21.968 --> 00:21:23.345
Wait.

00:21:24.054 --> 00:21:27.057
The fifth annual
Jeju AI Conference will be held.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.017
Why is he so successful anyway?

00:21:29.101 --> 00:21:30.811
I prayed for 100 days straight
for him to fail.

00:21:35.774 --> 00:21:37.776
Okay, Kim Jeong-gwon.

00:21:38.944 --> 00:21:39.986
Sit tight.

00:21:40.695 --> 00:21:42.155
I'm coming for you.

00:21:47.369 --> 00:21:48.453
Where is he staying?

00:21:48.537 --> 00:21:50.497
Daiabeach Hotel.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.915
I booked a room for you there.

00:21:51.998 --> 00:21:53.333
Okay. Good job.

00:21:53.417 --> 00:21:56.378
I hear he's notorious
for being picky and guarded

00:21:56.461 --> 00:21:58.505
and won't engage with anyone
he doesn't know.

00:21:58.588 --> 00:21:59.423
Really?

00:22:01.383 --> 00:22:03.051
You said he graduated
from Haemun High, right?

00:22:03.135 --> 00:22:05.554
I want a list of his teachers,

00:22:05.637 --> 00:22:08.765
along with the school anthem, uniform,
and even the cafeteria bestsellers.

00:22:08.849 --> 00:22:10.892
So you're going the alum route, huh?

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.394
Okay.

00:22:12.477 --> 00:22:14.312
It'll be in your inbox by the evening.

00:22:14.396 --> 00:22:17.399
You should enjoy Jeju until then.
I'm sure it's been a while.

00:22:17.482 --> 00:22:19.484
Okay. Keep up the good work.

00:22:19.568 --> 00:22:20.902
-Will do.
-Bye.

00:22:29.119 --> 00:22:30.704
At least the weather is nice.

00:22:31.621 --> 00:22:32.497
Damn it.

00:22:32.581 --> 00:22:35.458
I'll make sure I have an absolute blast,
if only out of spite.

00:23:02.777 --> 00:23:03.695
How much is it?

00:23:03.778 --> 00:23:05.030
It's 5,000 won.

00:23:05.697 --> 00:23:06.823
Thank you.

00:23:17.167 --> 00:23:18.168
This way!

00:23:30.639 --> 00:23:31.556
Enjoy.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.807
-Thank you.
-My goodness.

00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:34.059
-This looks so good.
-Dig in.

00:23:37.312 --> 00:23:39.189
GIANT GRILLED HAIRTAIL SET
125,000 WON

00:23:39.272 --> 00:23:40.649
TWO-SERVING MINIMUM

00:23:48.406 --> 00:23:49.407
I'm starving.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.660
They say this will give me a son.

00:23:51.743 --> 00:23:53.495
She's going to wear that thing out.

00:23:57.082 --> 00:23:58.083
Go Da-rim?

00:23:59.125 --> 00:24:00.126
It is, isn't it?

00:24:01.169 --> 00:24:02.671
The Psycho of Yeongpung Girls' High!

00:24:02.754 --> 00:24:04.130
It's me, Lee Su-jin!

00:24:04.214 --> 00:24:06.967
Lee Su-jin as in
the Yapper of Grade 12 Class 2?

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.760
-I can't believe it!
-Oh my gosh!

00:24:08.843 --> 00:24:10.845
It's been forever!

00:24:10.929 --> 00:24:13.556
It's already been over ten years.
This is unbelievable.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.559
Hey, you haven't changed one bit.

00:24:17.102 --> 00:24:18.144
Are you here on vacation?

00:24:18.228 --> 00:24:19.896
Yeah, I tagged along
on my boyfriend's work trip.

00:24:21.022 --> 00:24:22.232
There you are.

00:24:22.315 --> 00:24:24.651
Come and say hi
to my high school friend, Go Da-rim.

00:24:25.944 --> 00:24:27.070
Hello, it's nice…

00:24:35.745 --> 00:24:39.124
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Kim Jeong-gwon.

00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:42.544
You look like
a limp piece of over-blanched spinach.

00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:49.092
Right.

00:24:49.175 --> 00:24:50.719
Hello.

00:24:51.303 --> 00:24:52.554
Of course, you're shocked.

00:24:53.305 --> 00:24:55.015
-Isn't he so dreamy?
-Oh, please.

00:24:55.098 --> 00:24:56.558
Yeah.

00:24:56.641 --> 00:24:57.767
Are you here with your boyfriend too?

00:24:59.102 --> 00:25:00.020
Oh, did you come alone?

00:25:06.318 --> 00:25:09.863
Don't be silly.
Of course, I'm here with my boyfriend.

00:25:09.946 --> 00:25:13.658
I'm just alone today
because he's really busy.

00:25:14.242 --> 00:25:15.160
That's great.

00:25:15.243 --> 00:25:16.453
We were just about to eat.

00:25:16.536 --> 00:25:17.662
Join us.

00:25:17.746 --> 00:25:19.914
-You're okay with that, right?
-Of course.

00:25:20.749 --> 00:25:21.583
Join us.

00:25:25.295 --> 00:25:28.256
I really want to, but unfortunately,
I have other plans.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.008
Sorry. My boyfriend is calling.

00:25:30.091 --> 00:25:31.509
See you around. Enjoy your trip.

00:25:32.093 --> 00:25:34.971
Hey, babe. Of course, I'm having fun.

00:25:35.055 --> 00:25:36.222
Yeah.

00:25:36.306 --> 00:25:38.058
Okay, sure.

00:25:43.146 --> 00:25:45.440
-That was delicious. Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.402
I should've never come to Jeju.

00:25:49.986 --> 00:25:52.030
Why did I have to run into him,
of all people?

00:25:55.241 --> 00:25:56.743
MOM

00:25:58.578 --> 00:25:59.829
Hey, Mom.

00:25:59.913 --> 00:26:00.914
Did you eat?

00:26:00.997 --> 00:26:04.667
I was actually just enjoying
some grilled hairtail and mackerel.

00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:07.670
The meat is just so succulent

00:26:07.754 --> 00:26:09.381
and incredibly rich and savory.

00:26:09.464 --> 00:26:11.257
It's unbelievably delicious.

00:26:11.341 --> 00:26:12.175
Eat up.

00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:16.971
By the way, I got Da-jeong a rice cooker,
but told her that it was from you.

00:26:17.055 --> 00:26:18.223
Why did you do that?

00:26:18.306 --> 00:26:20.350
Hey, we're in the middle of a rush.

00:26:20.433 --> 00:26:21.351
I'm hanging up now.

00:26:21.935 --> 00:26:23.269
Just be aware of that.

00:26:23.353 --> 00:26:24.854
I have to go now.

00:26:24.938 --> 00:26:25.939
Wait, Mom.

00:26:57.011 --> 00:26:57.929
This is a real school?

00:26:58.012 --> 00:27:00.723
-I've never heard of it.
-Me neither.

00:27:00.807 --> 00:27:03.726
But still, I received a scholarship
for all four years.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.854
A crappy school only churns out
more crappy results.

00:27:06.521 --> 00:27:07.856
Right.

00:27:07.939 --> 00:27:09.774
We called you in
because you looked pretty in your photo,

00:27:09.858 --> 00:27:11.317
but you could use some upkeep.

00:27:12.277 --> 00:27:13.194
No father around.

00:27:13.278 --> 00:27:15.905
Kids like her
who grow up in unstable homes

00:27:15.989 --> 00:27:17.574
always end up getting into trouble.

00:27:18.533 --> 00:27:20.660
You could use some upkeep.

00:27:21.161 --> 00:27:23.204
Unstable homes…

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.291
Crappy results…

00:27:26.374 --> 00:27:27.542
Right?

00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:29.544
GONGJEONG BANK OF KOREA
INTERVIEW FOR NEW HIRES

00:27:44.809 --> 00:27:45.768
Dad.

00:27:47.562 --> 00:27:48.646
Dad!

00:27:49.522 --> 00:27:50.773
Dad…

00:28:04.954 --> 00:28:05.914
Life is simple.

00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:08.583
You just have to go for it.

00:28:09.792 --> 00:28:11.002
Just go for it.

00:28:11.085 --> 00:28:14.923
Let's go!

00:28:16.132 --> 00:28:17.175
Let's go.

00:28:18.718 --> 00:28:20.011
No…

00:28:22.764 --> 00:28:23.973
Let's go!

00:28:26.392 --> 00:28:28.478
Yes! Gong Ji-hyeok, hell yeah!

00:28:32.482 --> 00:28:33.691
No, you can't!

00:28:33.775 --> 00:28:35.902
Life may be tough,
but this isn't the answer.

00:28:35.985 --> 00:28:37.904
What the heck? Who are you?

00:28:37.987 --> 00:28:38.905
Let go of me!

00:28:38.988 --> 00:28:40.990
I know all too well how you feel.

00:28:41.074 --> 00:28:43.868
The rest of us aren't sticking around
because life is always sunny.

00:28:43.952 --> 00:28:46.246
You just have to hang in there
when it comes to life.

00:28:46.329 --> 00:28:49.040
You have to hang in there.
Just hang in there!

00:28:49.123 --> 00:28:50.583
Hang in where? Are you drunk?

00:28:50.667 --> 00:28:52.961
You've clearly lost your mind. Damn it!

00:28:57.382 --> 00:28:58.842
Yeah, I lost my mind.

00:28:59.801 --> 00:29:00.927
That's not all.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.097
I also have no money,
no boyfriend, and no dad!

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.348
So what?

00:29:05.431 --> 00:29:08.810
Even someone like me is hanging in there.
So why would you try to die? Why?

00:29:08.893 --> 00:29:11.062
Why would you die? Why?

00:29:11.145 --> 00:29:12.105
You can't die!

00:29:12.188 --> 00:29:13.273
Who's trying to die here?

00:29:13.356 --> 00:29:14.274
Let go of me already!

00:29:51.019 --> 00:29:52.854
That's going to take
about a week or two to heal.

00:29:52.937 --> 00:29:55.732
You must disinfect the wound
every two days.

00:29:58.818 --> 00:29:59.819
What a hassle.

00:30:03.615 --> 00:30:04.824
And as for Ms. Go Da-rim,

00:30:04.908 --> 00:30:08.202
we ran some tests on her
and didn't find anything,

00:30:08.286 --> 00:30:09.287
so you don't need to worry.

00:30:10.246 --> 00:30:11.748
But why isn't she waking up?

00:30:11.831 --> 00:30:13.791
We have a lot to discuss.

00:30:13.875 --> 00:30:17.378
It appears she's sleeping off
some alcohol.

00:30:19.589 --> 00:30:20.506
She's sleeping it off?

00:30:25.053 --> 00:30:27.305
She's definitely insane.

00:30:27.388 --> 00:30:29.390
What's wrong with you?

00:30:29.474 --> 00:30:33.269
Someone so handsome can't die!

00:30:33.353 --> 00:30:37.440
That would be a detrimental loss
for the nation…

00:30:38.232 --> 00:30:40.693
Do you get that?

00:30:40.777 --> 00:30:42.195
I'm going to head out.

00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:43.947
She'll take care of the bill.

00:30:57.627 --> 00:31:00.171
I mean, I am quite handsome.

00:31:02.006 --> 00:31:04.717
Her mind is damaged,
but I guess her vision is fine.

00:31:07.929 --> 00:31:09.430
-Hey, got updates?
-Yes.

00:31:09.514 --> 00:31:11.724
I confirmed that Kim Jeong-gwon
checked in.

00:31:11.808 --> 00:31:12.642
Okay.

00:31:12.725 --> 00:31:15.478
Then I'll discreetly try approaching him
at breakfast tomorrow.

00:31:15.561 --> 00:31:16.396
Also,

00:31:16.479 --> 00:31:19.857
I've sent you the school anthem as well,
so make sure to take a look.

00:31:19.941 --> 00:31:22.318
-Great. Thank you, Gyeong-min.
-Okay.

00:31:22.402 --> 00:31:23.528
Okay.

00:31:28.616 --> 00:31:32.412
The spirit of Mt. Cheonggye's blue vigor

00:31:33.579 --> 00:31:36.916
The proud Haemun grads

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.253
Spread across the world

00:31:40.336 --> 00:31:41.546
Okay, let's go!

00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:43.339
Did you say 270,000 won?

00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:45.174
That's for both of you.

00:31:45.258 --> 00:31:49.846
That includes the tests and treatment
received by the man you came with.

00:31:49.929 --> 00:31:51.681
Why would I pay for his treatment?

00:31:51.764 --> 00:31:53.057
Were you two not together?

00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:56.352
He said you would take care of both bills.

00:31:56.436 --> 00:31:58.479
How does this make any sense?

00:31:58.563 --> 00:31:59.939
This is so unfair.

00:32:00.023 --> 00:32:01.566
I was the one who saved his life.

00:32:01.649 --> 00:32:02.817
Will it be credit?

00:32:03.568 --> 00:32:04.819
Sorry. Just a moment.

00:32:05.403 --> 00:32:06.696
This is insane.

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:07.989
Hold on.

00:32:09.824 --> 00:32:11.284
Ten, twenty…

00:32:18.458 --> 00:32:19.584
But…

00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:29.719
How can I survive
two more days on 10,000 won?

00:32:34.515 --> 00:32:36.017
OUTPATIENT MEDICAL BILL AND RECEIPT
PATIENT NAME: GONG JI-HYEOK

00:32:39.562 --> 00:32:41.564
I saved a man's life,

00:32:41.647 --> 00:32:44.108
but he robbed me blind.

00:32:44.859 --> 00:32:45.985
A highway robbery.

00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:52.075
I was saving every penny
to buy gifts for Da-jeong and Mom.

00:32:55.328 --> 00:32:58.039
It's going to take me forever
to walk to the hotel.

00:32:59.582 --> 00:33:00.875
-Oh gosh.
-Do you need a ride?

00:33:00.958 --> 00:33:02.126
Where are you headed?

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:06.672
By chance, can you just drive me
3,000 won's worth?

00:33:06.756 --> 00:33:08.674
You must be bonkers.

00:33:13.262 --> 00:33:15.848
Yeah. I must be bonkers.

00:33:27.485 --> 00:33:28.611
I'm here.

00:33:28.694 --> 00:33:29.821
I'm finally here.

00:33:31.239 --> 00:33:34.117
That damn highway robber.
You're dead meat if I ever catch you.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.494
I'll…

00:33:36.577 --> 00:33:38.955
I'll teach you a lesson
you'll never forget.

00:33:56.806 --> 00:33:59.183
Breakfast. It's hotel breakfast time.

00:34:29.005 --> 00:34:32.216
The spirit of Mt. Cheonggye's blue vigor…

00:34:34.051 --> 00:34:35.386
Hotel breakfast…

00:34:41.642 --> 00:34:42.560
-You got this.
-Let's go.

00:34:45.563 --> 00:34:46.647
This looks so good.

00:34:47.648 --> 00:34:49.567
Right by the garden

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:51.319
with an amazing ocean view.

00:34:52.028 --> 00:34:53.571
I have to send this to Mom later.

00:35:00.077 --> 00:35:01.704
The spirit of Mt. Cheonggye…

00:35:08.002 --> 00:35:08.920
-Hey.
-Ji-hyeok!

00:35:09.003 --> 00:35:10.171
You haven't met Kim Jeong-gwon yet, right?

00:35:10.254 --> 00:35:11.589
No. Still waiting for him.

00:35:11.672 --> 00:35:12.715
Thank goodness.

00:35:13.382 --> 00:35:16.093
It seems the Haemun High tactic
is out of the question.

00:35:16.677 --> 00:35:17.845
I looked into it some more,

00:35:17.929 --> 00:35:19.847
and it looks like he was bullied
during high school.

00:35:19.931 --> 00:35:21.682
He apparently despises talking about it.

00:35:21.766 --> 00:35:23.517
Really? Glad you found that out.

00:35:23.601 --> 00:35:24.602
What do we do now?

00:35:25.478 --> 00:35:26.771
Let's try college years.

00:35:27.438 --> 00:35:29.732
See what his rep was back then,
and let me know as soon as possible.

00:35:29.815 --> 00:35:31.317
-You got it.
-Okay.

00:35:38.032 --> 00:35:39.784
Stop eating already.

00:35:39.867 --> 00:35:40.952
Here, honey.

00:35:41.035 --> 00:35:42.078
Have you lost your mind?

00:35:46.874 --> 00:35:48.084
Unbelievable.

00:35:51.796 --> 00:35:52.880
Come on, honey!

00:36:15.903 --> 00:36:18.698
You know, there's not much to life.

00:36:19.282 --> 00:36:21.284
Even when you feel like
you're going to die,

00:36:21.367 --> 00:36:23.077
you grow hungry around mealtime.

00:36:23.828 --> 00:36:27.456
And seeing a lavish hotel spread
cheers you right up. Don't you agree?

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:28.958
Ms. Go Da-rim?

00:36:30.334 --> 00:36:32.336
What are you even doing here?

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.213
Isn't it obvious? I'm a guest here.

00:36:35.214 --> 00:36:36.173
Hold on.

00:36:36.882 --> 00:36:37.967
How do you know my name?

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.636
I checked your ID
for the hospital paperwork yesterday.

00:36:42.972 --> 00:36:46.726
So you searched through my bag
and saw the envelope of cash.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:50.354
But still, there are lines
that one shouldn't cross.

00:36:50.438 --> 00:36:53.607
If not for me, you wouldn't have even seen
today's breakfast menu!

00:37:06.203 --> 00:37:07.288
I'm sorry,

00:37:07.371 --> 00:37:09.665
but I'm a little busy right now,
so let's finish this later.

00:37:13.586 --> 00:37:15.004
-Says who?
-Wait.

00:37:15.087 --> 00:37:19.258
Anyway, I'm sure you had your reasons
for resorting to such drastic measures.

00:37:19.342 --> 00:37:21.344
So just give me back my money,
and I won't report you.

00:37:21.427 --> 00:37:23.262
You see, I have quite a warm heart.

00:37:23.346 --> 00:37:25.681
I'm a bit busy right now.
Let's finish this later, okay?

00:37:26.265 --> 00:37:27.516
Are you kidding me right now?

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.519
My heart may be warm,
but my temper is fiery.

00:37:30.603 --> 00:37:32.063
Do you want to see it?

00:37:32.146 --> 00:37:33.147
Da-rim!

00:37:42.365 --> 00:37:43.783
I can't believe it!

00:37:43.866 --> 00:37:45.993
You're staying here too?

00:37:51.123 --> 00:37:52.875
Is he your boyfriend?

00:37:57.004 --> 00:37:59.090
Yeah. Let me introduce him.

00:37:59.173 --> 00:38:01.175
This is my boyfriend.

00:38:02.843 --> 00:38:05.846
Hello, I'm Da-rim's friend
from high school.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:07.640
My goodness, you're very handsome.

00:38:08.557 --> 00:38:11.936
If you haven't eaten yet,
how about we eat together?

00:38:12.019 --> 00:38:13.104
Are you okay with that?

00:38:13.187 --> 00:38:15.022
Sure. Why not?

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:21.445
I can't believe this just fell in my lap.

00:38:22.988 --> 00:38:24.573
We'd absolutely love to,

00:38:24.657 --> 00:38:26.742
but we actually just ate.

00:38:26.826 --> 00:38:28.953
Come on, babe.
I'm nowhere near done eating.

00:38:29.036 --> 00:38:30.871
Let's just eat a little bit more.

00:38:32.081 --> 00:38:33.332
I'm still hungry!

00:38:34.542 --> 00:38:35.418
Okay?

00:38:49.765 --> 00:38:51.767
I'm Da-rim's friend, Lee Su-jin.

00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:54.395
And this is my boyfriend, Kim Jeong-gwon.

00:38:55.104 --> 00:38:56.730
We both work in IT.

00:38:56.814 --> 00:38:58.274
It's nice to meet you.

00:38:59.567 --> 00:39:01.902
Da-rim, you should introduce
your boyfriend to us as well.

00:39:01.986 --> 00:39:03.737
Right, well…

00:39:04.321 --> 00:39:06.615
His name is…

00:39:12.121 --> 00:39:12.997
Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:39:14.582 --> 00:39:16.208
I work in management consulting.

00:39:17.209 --> 00:39:19.128
I discover startups with potential

00:39:19.211 --> 00:39:21.005
and connect them with investors.

00:39:21.088 --> 00:39:22.923
So, like a broker?

00:39:24.425 --> 00:39:26.969
More like a fairy godfather.

00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:29.638
A fairy godfather who dolls up
a dusty Cinderella

00:39:29.722 --> 00:39:32.933
to set her up with Prince Charming.

00:39:33.517 --> 00:39:34.643
"Fairy godfather"?

00:39:35.227 --> 00:39:36.645
But you know,

00:39:37.229 --> 00:39:39.273
I discovered fairies do really exist.

00:39:40.065 --> 00:39:41.609
Right here!

00:39:44.403 --> 00:39:46.530
You're such a romantic, Ji-hyeok.

00:39:47.823 --> 00:39:49.492
But how did you hurt your hand?

00:39:50.367 --> 00:39:51.535
Oh, this?

00:39:52.953 --> 00:39:55.498
My Da-rim kept pouncing on me yesterday.

00:39:57.124 --> 00:39:58.751
She just grabbed me from the back,

00:39:58.834 --> 00:40:01.128
and we ended up
rolling around on the ground…

00:40:05.299 --> 00:40:06.926
That's how I ended up like this.

00:40:08.636 --> 00:40:10.721
Look at you. You're still so aggressive.

00:40:10.804 --> 00:40:12.139
Gosh.

00:40:12.723 --> 00:40:15.684
Even when she was younger,
she used to be crazy about boys.

00:40:15.768 --> 00:40:18.521
Hey, you should eat. This is delicious.

00:40:24.818 --> 00:40:26.111
If you're free tonight,

00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:28.781
I'd love to invite you to a party.

00:40:30.241 --> 00:40:33.160
I happen to have two extra invites.

00:40:33.244 --> 00:40:34.286
"Party"?

00:40:35.454 --> 00:40:36.455
Yeah.

00:40:37.289 --> 00:40:38.791
We agreed to go earlier.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:43.128
That sounds great.

00:40:43.212 --> 00:40:44.421
Good thing I packed a dress.

00:40:44.505 --> 00:40:45.631
We should go.

00:40:46.298 --> 00:40:47.132
Sure. Why not?

00:40:47.216 --> 00:40:48.425
-Yes!
-Thank you for the invite.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:54.515
-Eat up.
-Okay.

00:41:01.897 --> 00:41:03.232
Are you in separate rooms?

00:41:03.315 --> 00:41:05.192
Oh, right. What now?

00:41:05.901 --> 00:41:06.819
Babe.

00:41:07.778 --> 00:41:08.779
The fifth floor

00:41:09.822 --> 00:41:10.990
is my apartment floor.

00:41:11.949 --> 00:41:12.825
Don't be so obvious.

00:41:12.908 --> 00:41:14.702
Oh, right.

00:41:15.536 --> 00:41:16.996
What floor are you guys on?

00:41:17.079 --> 00:41:18.581
Seventh as well.

00:41:18.664 --> 00:41:20.165
Who knew we were on the same floor?

00:41:20.874 --> 00:41:23.127
Damn it.
Why did it have to be the same floor?

00:41:35.055 --> 00:41:36.098
Go inside.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.975
Please go inside first.

00:41:40.811 --> 00:41:41.979
Go.

00:41:42.062 --> 00:41:43.564
Please go inside first.

00:41:47.359 --> 00:41:48.736
This is our room. Please excuse us.

00:41:52.489 --> 00:41:54.283
We'll see you at the party later.

00:41:54.908 --> 00:41:56.118
Sure.

00:41:56.201 --> 00:41:57.119
See you later, Da-rim.

00:41:57.202 --> 00:41:58.203
See you.

00:41:59.038 --> 00:42:00.247
Let's go.

00:42:11.008 --> 00:42:12.176
What do you think you're doing?

00:42:12.259 --> 00:42:13.302
Are you nuts?

00:42:13.385 --> 00:42:14.428
You started it.

00:42:16.263 --> 00:42:17.931
"Oh, he's my boyfriend."

00:42:19.808 --> 00:42:22.519
I'm sorry about that. It was an emergency.

00:42:23.979 --> 00:42:24.980
Emergency?

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.651
Kim Jeong-gwon is your ex, isn't he?

00:42:28.734 --> 00:42:29.610
How did you know that?

00:42:32.988 --> 00:42:34.323
He is.

00:42:34.406 --> 00:42:36.325
And it was a nasty breakup.

00:42:36.408 --> 00:42:38.327
So forget about this party.

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:40.871
I refuse to go,
so take care of the mess you made.

00:42:51.507 --> 00:42:52.841
What are you doing?

00:42:53.509 --> 00:42:54.385
Step back.

00:43:03.811 --> 00:43:05.187
I got injured because of you.

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:07.022
And it hurt a lot.

00:43:08.357 --> 00:43:11.527
How did a crybaby like you
ever consider suicide--

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.570
To start, I never had
any suicidal intentions.

00:43:14.321 --> 00:43:16.782
You were drunk
and decided to knock me over on your own.

00:43:16.865 --> 00:43:17.741
If it weren't for me…

00:43:19.868 --> 00:43:21.870
your head would've ended up like this.
Got that?

00:43:22.496 --> 00:43:23.872
That can't be true.

00:43:24.456 --> 00:43:27.126
I definitely saw you ready to jump.

00:43:27.209 --> 00:43:30.295
Would a suicidal man jump through
these hoops to scout Kim Jeong-gwon?

00:43:30.963 --> 00:43:33.924
You're trying to scout him?

00:43:35.634 --> 00:43:37.469
I need him for my business.

00:43:40.347 --> 00:43:42.266
That's why I followed him to Jeju.

00:43:44.101 --> 00:43:45.352
KIM JEONG-GWON'S CONNECTIONS

00:43:45.436 --> 00:43:47.771
Tonight's party is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity for me.

00:43:47.855 --> 00:43:48.814
So,

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.734
just be my girlfriend for the day.

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:55.362
Don't forget you used me earlier too.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:03.036
The money you asked for earlier…

00:44:04.121 --> 00:44:05.330
I'll triple it.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:07.708
Excuse me?

00:44:10.335 --> 00:44:11.462
Forget it. I'm not doing it.

00:44:11.545 --> 00:44:12.755
Ten times.

00:44:12.838 --> 00:44:13.756
Ten times?

00:44:17.176 --> 00:44:20.679
She didn't even buy me a fridge
or a measly rice cooker for my wedding.

00:44:23.974 --> 00:44:25.476
In full cash, right?

00:44:25.559 --> 00:44:27.019
Half up front. Deal?

00:44:28.479 --> 00:44:29.313
Deal.

00:44:30.105 --> 00:44:30.939
Okay.

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:10.521
DESERT ROSE
7,500,000 WON

00:45:11.438 --> 00:45:13.732
This dress is part of
the recent SS collection,

00:45:13.815 --> 00:45:16.151
and it features a ball gown silhouette.

00:45:17.736 --> 00:45:19.071
What in the world…

00:45:20.322 --> 00:45:22.366
-Let's keep this one.
-Yes, sir.

00:45:28.205 --> 00:45:30.499
Let's get out of here.
This place isn't it.

00:45:30.582 --> 00:45:32.084
Why? Not your style?

00:45:32.167 --> 00:45:33.168
Well…

00:45:34.253 --> 00:45:35.254
Let's just go.

00:45:35.337 --> 00:45:37.005
Thank you for your time.

00:45:37.089 --> 00:45:38.423
Thank you. We'll be back later.

00:45:38.507 --> 00:45:40.842
-Why? It's a nice brand.
-Come on, go.

00:45:40.926 --> 00:45:42.553
-Hold on. Wait.
-Quiet. Just go.

00:45:42.636 --> 00:45:43.845
Thank you.

00:45:44.471 --> 00:45:45.556
What's wrong?

00:45:46.598 --> 00:45:47.558
Huh?

00:45:48.267 --> 00:45:50.018
That place was way too expensive.

00:45:50.102 --> 00:45:52.437
Why spend so much
on a dress for just one night?

00:45:52.521 --> 00:45:53.939
It's so wasteful.

00:45:54.022 --> 00:45:55.315
No, it's an investment.

00:45:56.108 --> 00:45:57.985
Should my girlfriend
show up to such a party…

00:45:59.778 --> 00:46:00.654
What?

00:46:02.614 --> 00:46:04.366
In such dingy clothes?

00:46:06.493 --> 00:46:07.703
What did you just say?

00:46:08.287 --> 00:46:09.663
"Dingy"?

00:46:09.746 --> 00:46:13.750
A limp piece of over-blanched spinach.

00:46:14.251 --> 00:46:15.294
Did you call me dingy?

00:46:16.628 --> 00:46:18.422
You need to watch what you say.

00:46:18.505 --> 00:46:20.132
How could you say that to someone?

00:46:20.215 --> 00:46:22.301
That's nothing to be this angry about.

00:46:22.384 --> 00:46:23.927
It certainly is!

00:46:24.011 --> 00:46:25.012
Apologize.

00:46:25.679 --> 00:46:26.888
Or I refuse to work with you.

00:46:33.687 --> 00:46:34.813
My goodness!

00:46:38.483 --> 00:46:39.776
Oh no!

00:46:40.444 --> 00:46:41.320
Are you okay?

00:46:41.403 --> 00:46:43.238
It's dangerous.
You should wait over there.

00:46:43.905 --> 00:46:45.407
Sorry. It'll just be a second.

00:46:46.116 --> 00:46:48.201
Sorry. It won't take long.

00:46:48.285 --> 00:46:49.453
Just a second.

00:46:49.536 --> 00:46:50.787
Come on!

00:46:51.538 --> 00:46:52.581
Hurry!

00:46:55.334 --> 00:46:56.543
Sorry.

00:46:57.919 --> 00:46:59.713
Listen, Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:46:59.796 --> 00:47:01.965
Even in an employer-employee relationship,

00:47:02.049 --> 00:47:05.719
you must observe
basic human decency and etiquette.

00:47:05.802 --> 00:47:07.679
My thoughts exactly.

00:47:07.763 --> 00:47:08.930
That's exactly what I want.

00:47:09.014 --> 00:47:11.808
Appropriate attire for the occasion
would be basic etiquette.

00:47:11.892 --> 00:47:13.727
Then you should've worded it as such.

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:16.355
Instead, you insulted me,
calling me dingy and whatnot.

00:47:16.438 --> 00:47:18.523
Why resort to demeaning comments?

00:47:18.607 --> 00:47:19.524
Grab that.

00:47:19.608 --> 00:47:22.861
I'm just saying, we should showcase you
in the light of success and refinement.

00:47:22.944 --> 00:47:24.821
-Grab that as well.
-Okay.

00:47:26.657 --> 00:47:29.117
That would enhance
the credibility of my proposal, no?

00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:30.035
Take these.

00:47:30.118 --> 00:47:32.204
-Is that it?
-That's all of them.

00:47:32.287 --> 00:47:33.497
Stay here.

00:47:35.374 --> 00:47:36.333
What just happened?

00:47:36.416 --> 00:47:37.376
Are you okay?

00:47:37.459 --> 00:47:39.127
You must've been so surprised.

00:47:39.795 --> 00:47:41.338
Mischievous tangerines.

00:47:41.421 --> 00:47:42.964
-Yes, they are.
-Thank you so much.

00:47:43.048 --> 00:47:44.591
-No worries.
-Thank you.

00:47:45.133 --> 00:47:46.134
-Take these.
-Thank you.

00:47:46.218 --> 00:47:47.260
Thank you so much.

00:47:47.344 --> 00:47:48.887
-No worries. Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:50.555
Thank you.

00:47:50.639 --> 00:47:52.432
-Be careful. Bye.
-Bye.

00:47:52.516 --> 00:47:53.517
High five!

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:12.077
So, are you going to apologize or not?

00:48:13.161 --> 00:48:13.995
What?

00:48:15.956 --> 00:48:16.790
Right.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:19.751
I'll apologize.

00:48:23.171 --> 00:48:24.631
I don't want the person I love

00:48:25.424 --> 00:48:28.301
to feel even slightly pitiful
in front of her ex.

00:48:30.762 --> 00:48:31.596
Tonight,

00:48:33.306 --> 00:48:35.142
I want you to be the most beautiful.

00:48:37.436 --> 00:48:38.854
It seems that my greed

00:48:39.688 --> 00:48:41.148
led me to make such a rude comment.

00:48:42.816 --> 00:48:43.942
I'm sorry.

00:48:47.446 --> 00:48:48.989
Then, let's go.

00:48:49.573 --> 00:48:51.158
We can invest or whatever.

00:49:09.718 --> 00:49:11.178
Thank you, sir.

00:49:13.054 --> 00:49:15.807
Are we not even going to try it on first?

00:49:15.891 --> 00:49:18.518
It'll suit you. I have a discerning eye.

00:49:18.602 --> 00:49:20.687
But we should still see if it fits.

00:49:20.771 --> 00:49:22.189
It'll fit.

00:49:26.735 --> 00:49:29.446
Thanks to rolling around yesterday,
I figured out your size.

00:49:42.375 --> 00:49:44.127
Mr. Gong! We need to--

00:49:44.211 --> 00:49:45.420
Please look forward.

00:49:46.755 --> 00:49:48.256
How about this? It's the latest trend.

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.634
-I think this will suit her better.
-We need to talk.

00:49:50.717 --> 00:49:52.260
What are you two talking about?

00:49:52.344 --> 00:49:53.470
Curls…

00:49:54.679 --> 00:49:56.264
Let's go with these bangs.

00:49:56.348 --> 00:49:59.059
Mr. Gong, so what am I doing here?

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:03.104
Okay.

00:50:05.774 --> 00:50:07.192
Where are you going?

00:50:07.275 --> 00:50:08.777
At least tell me what's going on.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.237
Wait. What?

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.906
-We'll get started now.
-Start what?

00:50:12.989 --> 00:50:14.449
Hold on. Wait.

00:50:15.033 --> 00:50:16.409
Hang on.

00:50:16.493 --> 00:50:17.953
Wait, miss.

00:50:18.036 --> 00:50:19.704
No, you can't do that.

00:51:18.638 --> 00:51:21.558
I look awkward, don't I?

00:51:23.476 --> 00:51:24.686
A real-life fairy masterpiece.

00:51:25.604 --> 00:51:28.565
A fairy? I mean… You think so?

00:51:28.648 --> 00:51:30.108
Not you. Me.

00:51:30.692 --> 00:51:32.110
-What?
-I'm the fairy godfather.

00:51:32.193 --> 00:51:33.320
What?

00:51:34.863 --> 00:51:37.949
A result like this would give
Cinderella a run for her money, no?

00:51:39.242 --> 00:51:40.994
-Bibbidi-Bobbidi…
-Boo?

00:51:41.828 --> 00:51:42.746
Okay.

00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:44.122
Jeez.

00:51:47.083 --> 00:51:48.960
Kim Jeong-gwon will be filled with regret.

00:51:49.586 --> 00:51:51.630
Would that help your cause?

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:56.551
Envy or whatever may come,
if it makes him take an interest in me…

00:51:59.095 --> 00:51:59.930
it'll be helpful.

00:52:01.681 --> 00:52:02.974
Give me your hand.

00:53:03.868 --> 00:53:07.163
"Gong Ji-hyeok, born in 1994.
30 years old."

00:53:07.247 --> 00:53:09.958
"CEO of JH Consulting."

00:53:10.041 --> 00:53:13.712
"Met at a friend's wedding
on September 14, 2024."

00:53:13.795 --> 00:53:16.089
"Love at first sight.
Dating for six months."

00:53:18.341 --> 00:53:20.343
"Date nights are usually spent
watching movies at home."

00:53:20.427 --> 00:53:21.636
"The most recent film was…"

00:53:57.005 --> 00:53:57.964
Are you ready?

00:53:58.882 --> 00:54:00.425
Hold on.

00:54:06.723 --> 00:54:08.099
I think I am.

00:54:36.169 --> 00:54:38.171
We've been dating for six months.

00:54:38.254 --> 00:54:40.590
Fell in love at first sight
at a friend's wedding.

00:54:40.673 --> 00:54:43.134
Date nights are usually spent
watching movies at home.

00:54:43.218 --> 00:54:44.260
The most recent film was…

00:54:45.053 --> 00:54:46.179
-Notting Hill.
-Notting Hill.

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:49.808
-And planning to get married next spring.
-Right.

00:54:59.901 --> 00:55:01.528
-Who was that?
-No clue.

00:55:08.284 --> 00:55:09.494
Da-rim, over here.

00:55:16.042 --> 00:55:19.337
Da-rim, you look so pretty.

00:55:21.256 --> 00:55:22.298
Look at that ring.

00:55:22.382 --> 00:55:23.716
Did he propose?

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:26.094
Oh, this?

00:55:27.178 --> 00:55:29.305
We're thinking next spring.

00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:33.560
I wanted to get married sooner,

00:55:33.643 --> 00:55:34.769
but my Da-rim

00:55:35.812 --> 00:55:37.355
wanted a spring wedding.

00:55:37.438 --> 00:55:39.232
Congratulations.

00:55:39.315 --> 00:55:41.234
Jeong-gwon, isn't my friend so pretty?

00:55:41.818 --> 00:55:44.362
Yeah. You look beautiful.

00:55:44.445 --> 00:55:45.780
"Beautiful"? Oh, please.

00:55:45.864 --> 00:55:48.575
I'd say I'm a piece of
over-blanched spinach at best.

00:55:48.658 --> 00:55:51.369
"Over-blanched spinach"?
What kind of lunatic said that to you?

00:55:51.452 --> 00:55:52.537
I know, right?

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.497
But someone did.

00:55:55.165 --> 00:55:55.999
A real lunatic.

00:55:57.041 --> 00:55:58.751
He failed to see intrinsic value.

00:55:59.335 --> 00:56:02.213
Thanks to people like him,
value investors like me

00:56:03.298 --> 00:56:04.215
get to reap the profits.

00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:06.634
Da-rim was a diamond in the rough.

00:56:06.718 --> 00:56:08.761
It's just that she doesn't care
about getting dressed up.

00:56:10.972 --> 00:56:12.599
But just a little attention…

00:56:15.435 --> 00:56:17.145
allows her to shine like this.

00:56:23.401 --> 00:56:24.986
Are you enjoying the party?

00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:26.321
It's all right.

00:56:27.155 --> 00:56:29.240
It seems more business-oriented.

00:56:29.324 --> 00:56:32.160
That's why the guest list is so exclusive.

00:56:32.243 --> 00:56:33.369
So, what about you?

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.331
Are you happy with your current company?

00:56:36.998 --> 00:56:39.709
I've been consulting
with this IT company recently,

00:56:40.293 --> 00:56:42.503
and their planning
and sales capabilities are top-notch,

00:56:42.587 --> 00:56:44.881
but their development capabilities
fall a bit short.

00:56:44.964 --> 00:56:47.008
-Is that so?
-Yes.

00:56:47.091 --> 00:56:49.177
We're going to grab a bite to eat.

00:56:54.015 --> 00:56:56.643
Babe, about that company,

00:56:57.602 --> 00:56:59.354
what was its enterprise value again?

00:57:03.858 --> 00:57:05.193
It's not much now.

00:57:06.611 --> 00:57:08.279
Around two or three hundred billion won?

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.033
If I could get a developer
like Jeong-gwon on board,

00:57:12.116 --> 00:57:13.701
I could turn it into a unicorn
in six months.

00:57:13.785 --> 00:57:15.495
-Such a shame, huh?
-Yeah.

00:57:16.996 --> 00:57:19.207
Unicorn? As in one trillion won?

00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:22.168
A company's EV could rise that much
just because of one developer?

00:57:24.254 --> 00:57:25.171
Excuse me.

00:57:26.089 --> 00:57:26.923
Thank you.

00:57:29.968 --> 00:57:31.427
Nitric acid and sulfuric acid

00:57:32.428 --> 00:57:34.305
are dangerous substances in themselves,

00:57:34.389 --> 00:57:35.890
but when they're combined…

00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:40.103
they become a potent explosive.

00:57:40.645 --> 00:57:42.146
Nitroglycerin.

00:57:42.689 --> 00:57:43.648
Also known as…

00:57:44.857 --> 00:57:46.150
dynamite.

00:57:47.944 --> 00:57:49.362
A chemical reaction.

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:55.493
There's an art to combining people
and companies as well.

00:57:56.119 --> 00:57:57.287
And when it comes to

00:57:58.037 --> 00:57:59.622
discovering such combinations,

00:58:00.957 --> 00:58:02.041
I'm a pro.

00:58:03.084 --> 00:58:04.294
What do you think?

00:58:04.377 --> 00:58:05.712
Dynamite.

00:58:05.795 --> 00:58:07.255
Would you be interested?

00:58:26.524 --> 00:58:28.776
No.

00:58:32.572 --> 00:58:35.116
You're doing fine. Yeah.

00:58:35.199 --> 00:58:36.242
Don't get scared.

00:58:37.035 --> 00:58:38.036
You got this!

00:58:46.544 --> 00:58:47.754
Are you serious right now?

00:58:50.798 --> 00:58:51.674
What do you mean?

00:58:53.926 --> 00:58:55.428
There's been a surge

00:58:56.054 --> 00:59:00.016
of punks approaching me lately, using
my schooling, hometown, and relatives.

00:59:01.142 --> 00:59:04.228
But this is the first time
one has used an ex-girlfriend.

00:59:04.312 --> 00:59:06.189
I must admit it's innovative.

00:59:07.899 --> 00:59:11.569
I guess a taste of success
has left you blinded by your inflated ego.

00:59:11.653 --> 00:59:13.988
You believe the world
is at your feet, don't you?

00:59:14.072 --> 00:59:16.658
You really need to pull yourself together.

00:59:16.741 --> 00:59:20.244
Ji-hyeok and I
are in a committed relationship.

00:59:21.287 --> 00:59:23.081
As if I don't know you.

00:59:23.164 --> 00:59:26.584
There's no love in your eyes
when you look at him.

00:59:27.835 --> 00:59:29.879
You didn't look at me like that.

00:59:35.051 --> 00:59:38.137
Gosh, what a relief.

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:41.224
I guess it's because I'm being loved.

00:59:41.974 --> 00:59:43.935
I'm not pathetically clinging

00:59:44.018 --> 00:59:46.104
and begging for love,
like I did back then.

00:59:46.187 --> 00:59:49.565
I guess even my eyes have also regained
a sense of self-esteem.

00:59:49.649 --> 00:59:51.401
Use your common sense and hear me out.

00:59:51.484 --> 00:59:54.654
Let's say you two are really dating
and are here on a trip.

00:59:54.737 --> 00:59:57.281
Are you saying you two
just happened to run into me

00:59:57.365 --> 00:59:59.951
with a job proposal, of all times?

01:00:01.494 --> 01:00:02.995
You expect me to believe that?

01:00:04.288 --> 01:00:05.581
How much did he offer you?

01:00:06.249 --> 01:00:08.292
I'll pay you instead,
so just drop the act.

01:00:09.752 --> 01:00:11.212
Whether you accept his offer or not,

01:00:11.295 --> 01:00:13.506
that's your choice to make.

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:16.050
But don't speak ill of him.

01:00:16.592 --> 01:00:18.136
He's the man I love.

01:00:20.138 --> 01:00:21.389
Have you lost your damn mind?

01:00:33.651 --> 01:00:35.445
Tell me, Ji-hyeok.

01:00:35.528 --> 01:00:37.655
What made you fall for Da-rim?

01:00:38.281 --> 01:00:40.116
Well,

01:00:40.199 --> 01:00:43.202
I'm not sure if I should answer
that question right now.

01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:46.873
Once I start talking about her charms,

01:00:47.999 --> 01:00:49.292
we'd be here all night.

01:00:49.375 --> 01:00:50.209
Would you be okay with that?

01:00:54.964 --> 01:00:58.092
What about you?
What made you fall in love with me?

01:00:59.469 --> 01:01:03.389
Well, I like that you take
good care of your business.

01:01:03.473 --> 01:01:06.517
It shows you have passion
and a sense of responsibility.

01:01:07.477 --> 01:01:11.230
Gosh, you're silly. Who isn't like that?

01:01:11.314 --> 01:01:13.357
There are plenty of people like that.

01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:17.445
People who waste time,
refusing to study or work properly.

01:01:17.528 --> 01:01:18.863
A waste of space.

01:01:18.946 --> 01:01:20.198
There's a surprising number of them.

01:01:20.281 --> 01:01:21.657
Right?

01:01:22.492 --> 01:01:23.534
I'm not sure.

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:26.537
There's no way of knowing for sure

01:01:27.663 --> 01:01:30.666
if it's a lack of opportunity or effort
that's the issue for those people.

01:01:31.793 --> 01:01:35.588
I'm not about judging people
just based on their achievements.

01:01:35.671 --> 01:01:38.341
I find it a bit too superficial
and snobby.

01:01:38.424 --> 01:01:41.385
You said you're planning
to get married next spring, right?

01:01:42.094 --> 01:01:45.598
-That's right.
-Then, you must've met her parents.

01:01:46.224 --> 01:01:47.642
Of course, I met both of them.

01:01:48.559 --> 01:01:49.936
I see.

01:01:50.019 --> 01:01:52.814
You met both of them.

01:01:55.691 --> 01:01:57.985
I was only able to meet her father
through a picture.

01:01:58.986 --> 01:02:01.948
It would've been nice
if we had met while he was still alive.

01:02:04.367 --> 01:02:07.036
I'd like to believe

01:02:08.037 --> 01:02:11.040
that he's looking down on us
and cheering us on.

01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:16.045
Yeah, I lost my mind.

01:02:16.128 --> 01:02:17.255
That's not all.

01:02:17.338 --> 01:02:21.259
I also have no money,
no boyfriend, and no dad! So what?

01:02:29.475 --> 01:02:33.354
Then, what about her siblings?

01:02:33.437 --> 01:02:36.107
Babe, I'm feeling really sick
all of a sudden.

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:37.692
-What?
-I feel a bit feverish too.

01:02:37.775 --> 01:02:39.193
Let's go grab some medicine.

01:02:39.277 --> 01:02:42.029
Please excuse us for a moment.
My stomach hurts so much.

01:02:42.113 --> 01:02:44.448
-Okay, let's go.
-My goodness.

01:02:44.532 --> 01:02:46.242
-Excuse us.
-What…

01:02:52.206 --> 01:02:53.291
What are we going to do?

01:02:58.754 --> 01:03:00.715
I think he's figured us out.

01:03:01.299 --> 01:03:03.301
He's just going to keep digging.
What should we do?

01:03:03.384 --> 01:03:06.262
I'm shaking in my boots here.
I don't think I can continue.

01:03:06.345 --> 01:03:08.764
From what I see, he's green with envy.

01:03:09.765 --> 01:03:12.602
Well, it was also what I was going for.

01:03:12.685 --> 01:03:14.478
You just don't know.

01:03:14.562 --> 01:03:16.314
He can be quite perceptive.

01:03:16.397 --> 01:03:18.482
He was outright interrogating me earlier,

01:03:18.566 --> 01:03:20.359
asking about my cut for scouting him.

01:03:20.443 --> 01:03:22.403
-Really?
-Yes.

01:03:26.824 --> 01:03:27.825
Then, let's do this.

01:03:28.409 --> 01:03:31.329
Let's stop here for today
and try to buy some time.

01:03:31.412 --> 01:03:33.039
Please make your way to the Sky Garden…

01:03:33.122 --> 01:03:37.043
And we'll set something up
after we're fully briefed on each other.

01:03:37.126 --> 01:03:40.004
That will also give you a chance
to tell me more about him.

01:03:41.422 --> 01:03:44.508
And you should set up
a dinner for us in Seoul with Su-jin.

01:03:44.592 --> 01:03:46.594
The firework display will begin shortly.

01:03:46.677 --> 01:03:48.429
-Ji-hyeok.
-What?

01:03:48.512 --> 01:03:51.641
-What?
-Please make your way…

01:03:51.724 --> 01:03:52.600
Okay.

01:03:53.267 --> 01:03:54.727
I'm not asking you to do it for free.

01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:56.687
I'll be sure to compensate--

01:04:42.483 --> 01:04:43.776
That was close.

01:04:45.778 --> 01:04:46.612
I'm sorry.

01:04:46.696 --> 01:04:49.657
Jeong-gwon was walking toward us.

01:04:50.866 --> 01:04:53.285
I kept sending you signals,

01:04:53.369 --> 01:04:55.705
but you weren't picking up on any of them.

01:04:57.248 --> 01:05:00.751
It's better than getting caught, right?

01:05:02.503 --> 01:05:03.337
Are you mad?

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.302
I'm going to head out first.

01:05:10.928 --> 01:05:12.096
I must be out of my mind.

01:05:20.771 --> 01:05:21.772
Should we…

01:05:23.566 --> 01:05:24.775
do that again?

01:05:26.444 --> 01:05:27.319
Sorry?

01:05:27.403 --> 01:05:29.238
Let's do that again.

01:06:46.023 --> 01:06:46.982
That night,

01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:49.944
we were nitric acid and sulfuric acid.

01:06:51.195 --> 01:06:52.196
And our kiss…

01:06:55.491 --> 01:06:56.700
was dynamite.

01:07:12.383 --> 01:07:17.304
DYNAMITE KISS

01:07:37.408 --> 01:07:40.327
So, maybe we should remain
a couple for one more day.

01:07:40.411 --> 01:07:41.620
Let's go on a date.

01:07:41.704 --> 01:07:44.665
I can't believe he asked me out.
This is insane!

01:07:44.748 --> 01:07:45.624
Hey, Seon-u. What's up?

01:07:45.708 --> 01:07:48.002
You need to come back right now.
Your mom has collapsed.

01:07:48.085 --> 01:07:50.129
I didn't even have a chance
to say goodbye.

01:07:50.212 --> 01:07:52.131
He must think I'm a weirdo.

01:07:52.214 --> 01:07:53.883
What's so special about her anyway?

01:07:53.966 --> 01:07:55.426
She blew my mind.

01:07:55.509 --> 01:07:56.635
Then you have to find her, no matter what!

01:07:56.719 --> 01:07:58.762
-Welcome to the company.
-A TF team?

01:07:58.846 --> 01:08:01.307
We're planning to put together
a team of moms.

01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:02.892
I know this is wrong.

01:08:02.975 --> 01:08:05.644
I honestly don't think
I have any other choice left.

01:08:06.228 --> 01:08:09.231
Hello. My name is Go Da-rim.

01:08:09.315 --> 01:08:14.111
