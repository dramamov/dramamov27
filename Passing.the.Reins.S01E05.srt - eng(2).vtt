00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:09.147
ROYAL HOPE

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:10.748
Royal Human's Horse Racing Division

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:14.652
purchased Royal Hope, a new horse
born in Hidaka, for 100 million yen.

00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:18.456
However, once the training
to be a racehorse began,

00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:20.158
he proved to be uncontrollable.

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:22.227
Even his debut is in jeopardy.

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:25.063
Hironaka's only hope

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.765
was Saki Ryujiro, a jockey in Iwate.

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:29.067
Hope trusted him.

00:00:29.134 --> 00:00:31.236
Number 12, Royal Hope, is slow to start.

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:34.239
Despite being slow in his debut,
he overwhelmed Valshare,

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:35.840
owned by Yoshihiro Shiina,

00:00:35.907 --> 00:00:38.510
and shocked the national
horse racing world, but…

00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:44.682
THE ROYAL HUMAN PRESIDENT
HAS AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:53.424
An illegitimate child? What is this about?

00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:56.427
Everyone is agitated.

00:00:56.995 --> 00:00:58.663
Can you explain?

00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:01.799
My private life is none of your business.

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:02.834
It is.

00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:06.771
I don't know how to answer
the stakeholders.

00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:09.874
Just tell me what you can.

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:12.777
All men are the same…

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:15.580
We're heading out. We'll be back at four.

00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:16.514
Take care.

00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:19.617
President, the fact
that you're not denying it…

00:01:19.684 --> 00:01:21.686
May I take this rumor as true?

00:01:21.753 --> 00:01:23.721
You only need to think about horses.

00:01:25.056 --> 00:01:26.391
"Never betray me."

00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:28.760
You told me that, President.

00:01:29.694 --> 00:01:31.596
I have never forgotten those words.

00:01:32.197 --> 00:01:34.799
I believe I've done my best
to live up to them.

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:36.334
But…

00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:39.370
If you don't even trust me
enough to talk to me.

00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:42.373
What am I even here for?

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:48.046
Your dream is my dream too.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.384
Get the car. We're going to Maebashi.

00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:58.556
The woman's name is Mikiko Nakajo.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.625
She used to be a hostess in Ginza.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.528
It's strange, you know.

00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:06.097
When someone else is around,
it doesn't happen,

00:02:06.164 --> 00:02:10.034
but whenever we try
to meet alone, it rains.

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.238
Though today you're here.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:17.342
We hadn't been in touch for a long time.

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:20.345
But I was out drinking in Ginza
with an old friend,

00:02:21.045 --> 00:02:23.281
and we got to talking about her.

00:02:27.218 --> 00:02:28.953
She has about a year left.

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:37.228
Hey.

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:44.502
He works with me on the horses.

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.305
I'm Eiji Kurisu, his secretary.

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:51.676
He kept asking where I've been going,
so I just brought him along.

00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:52.777
Please excuse me.

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:55.813
He knows the situation.

00:02:56.347 --> 00:02:57.515
You can trust him.

00:03:00.852 --> 00:03:02.053
Oh, right.

00:03:02.654 --> 00:03:05.723
Congratulations on your debut race.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.525
Royal…

00:03:07.592 --> 00:03:09.127
-It's Hope.
-Right.

00:03:09.694 --> 00:03:11.195
Royal Hope.

00:03:11.262 --> 00:03:12.430
Thank you.

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:15.366
I offered to bet on them for you.

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:18.469
I didn't want to trouble you.

00:03:20.738 --> 00:03:21.606
I'll take them.

00:03:22.407 --> 00:03:24.142
-No, I'll handle it.
-It's fine.

00:03:24.776 --> 00:03:26.711
He's restless around me.

00:03:26.778 --> 00:03:30.248
He always leaves the room so quickly.

00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:36.554
Why come here
in the first place, I wonder.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.462
He got in a weekly magazine?

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.134
I guess the President
is just that popular.

00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:51.636
I'm sorry.

00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:57.709
Oh, um, if you don't mind me asking…

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:01.346
About my child?

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.019
His name is Nakajo Koichi.

00:04:09.354 --> 00:04:10.421
He's in university.

00:04:10.488 --> 00:04:12.590
I haven't told him about his father.

00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:15.393
And yet, the President

00:04:16.427 --> 00:04:20.164
suddenly showed up here
without even calling me first.

00:04:20.898 --> 00:04:23.067
What do you think he said first?

00:04:25.303 --> 00:04:29.273
"I prepared a private room.
Give me your bank details."

00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:32.510
I'm so sick of it.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.984
Sir.

00:04:44.255 --> 00:04:45.623
My Ginza bar friends,

00:04:46.457 --> 00:04:48.993
I used to take them to lots of races.

00:04:51.028 --> 00:04:55.066
Everyone was excited at first,
but then one by one, they stopped coming.

00:04:56.334 --> 00:04:59.103
In the end, only Mikiko remained.

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:05.977
I mean, she had a strange reaction to it.

00:05:06.778 --> 00:05:10.782
When talking about horse racing,
people often mention betting, right?

00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:14.986
But when she first sat down, she muttered…

00:05:16.187 --> 00:05:19.891
The green turf is so beautiful.

00:05:19.957 --> 00:05:21.692
That was interesting.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.461
So I even took her to Arima.

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:29.934
Kanto around New Year
is usually clear and sunny, but…

00:05:31.068 --> 00:05:32.737
It was raining that day too.

00:05:34.138 --> 00:05:36.707
Couldn't see the course due to the rain.

00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:40.511
The race was a mess.
"Sorry, today is terrible," I told her.

00:05:40.578 --> 00:05:41.813
No way!

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.148
I felt sorry for her, but…

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:45.716
I won!

00:05:45.783 --> 00:05:47.418
I can see that. Seriously?

00:05:48.753 --> 00:05:50.188
You would think it was a fluke.

00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:53.191
But before the race started,

00:05:53.257 --> 00:05:55.726
she was looking at the horses
and taking notes.

00:05:57.128 --> 00:06:00.231
"In this weather, it takes power to run.

00:06:00.798 --> 00:06:03.901
The horse with strong footing
will probably win."

00:06:03.968 --> 00:06:05.369
She knew nothing of horses.

00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:08.539
She has a good eye for horses.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.541
An eye for horses, huh?

00:06:13.945 --> 00:06:15.546
She's a strange woman.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.982
Nearly 20 years later,

00:06:18.883 --> 00:06:20.551
I heard she was sick.

00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:24.422
I looked up the hospital
and went to visit.

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:26.524
Then she said,

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:30.962
"My son is coming by today.

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:34.432
Koichi is coming, so please leave."

00:06:37.235 --> 00:06:39.737
I didn't know anything.

00:06:42.406 --> 00:06:44.175
Seriously, I'm so pathetic.

00:06:45.243 --> 00:06:48.613
I'll handle Koichi by myself.

00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:52.049
No need to help me.

00:06:58.823 --> 00:06:59.891
The key.

00:07:02.894 --> 00:07:04.262
I failed to see it.

00:07:05.396 --> 00:07:07.832
-See what?
-Everything, I suppose.

00:07:09.467 --> 00:07:11.602
The fact you had a secret child,

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.972
the things you were doing in secret,

00:07:15.573 --> 00:07:18.709
and that you're trying
to handle this alone.

00:07:20.745 --> 00:07:22.313
That's just how I am.

00:07:23.047 --> 00:07:24.415
If you don't like it, quit.

00:07:24.482 --> 00:07:26.417
-If I quit, you would be hurt.
-The key!

00:07:26.484 --> 00:07:28.853
How about letting it out a little bit?

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.289
Have a good cry, then you'll feel better!

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:32.723
I…

00:07:33.658 --> 00:07:36.394
That good-luck watch you gave me,

00:07:36.928 --> 00:07:39.697
and all the bet payout money
you allowed me to keep,

00:07:39.764 --> 00:07:42.400
I've held onto them,
so I can always give them back.

00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:44.735
If you are ever in trouble,

00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:48.005
I would gladly give
everything I have to help you.

00:07:49.373 --> 00:07:55.246
You have a mission, to take Hope to Arima.

00:07:56.047 --> 00:07:58.649
I will help take care
of Ms. Mikiko for you.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.453
Leave it all to me.

00:08:03.754 --> 00:08:05.756
What I gave you,

00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:09.594
I won't ever ask for back.
I'm not that pathetic.

00:08:11.395 --> 00:08:12.630
And…

00:08:14.932 --> 00:08:16.334
I've put my hopes on you.

00:08:17.101 --> 00:08:18.903
Don't ever betray me.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.838
If you betray me,

00:08:23.441 --> 00:08:25.743
I'll have no choice but to kill you.

00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:29.180
Will you still do it?

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.725
Even if something
were to happen to you tomorrow,

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:44.195
I would still help you handle it.

00:08:46.297 --> 00:08:48.599
"The problem was the gate"…

00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:52.670
G1. The highest-ranked races
in horse racing.

00:08:53.738 --> 00:08:56.941
The Classic Triple Crown consists of
the Spring and Fall Tenno Sho Races,

00:08:57.008 --> 00:09:00.678
and one that concludes the year,
a winter tradition,

00:09:00.745 --> 00:09:02.380
the Arima Kinen.

00:09:02.446 --> 00:09:07.785
Every year,
around 8,000 thoroughbreds are born.

00:09:07.852 --> 00:09:10.855
But the number of horses
allowed to compete in a G1 race

00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:12.890
is 18, at most.

00:09:12.957 --> 00:09:13.791
Royal Hope…

00:09:13.858 --> 00:09:17.728
Winning a G1 means carving
your name into the long history

00:09:18.362 --> 00:09:19.997
of the sport.

00:09:20.064 --> 00:09:20.998
Come on, Hope.

00:09:21.065 --> 00:09:23.668
Let's get hyped up, come on!

00:09:23.734 --> 00:09:27.204
VALSHARE

00:09:31.108 --> 00:09:33.044
KOZO'S WIFE

00:09:45.523 --> 00:09:48.025
So, what happened
with the President and his wife?

00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:51.429
Will they get a divorce?

00:09:52.329 --> 00:09:53.631
No way.

00:09:54.932 --> 00:09:57.435
A late-life divorce isn't cost-efficient.

00:09:58.502 --> 00:10:00.104
They won't break up.

00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:03.741
Calculations and compromises.

00:10:04.275 --> 00:10:06.177
These are always necessary.

00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:09.113
Even among family.

00:10:25.996 --> 00:10:29.433
13TH NAKAYAMA STAKES LAUREL AWARD

00:10:35.272 --> 00:10:38.008
So there really are such things
as secret children.

00:10:39.877 --> 00:10:41.011
It's scary.

00:10:41.078 --> 00:10:44.849
The magazine is the problem…
making money off of someone's life.

00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:47.418
Listen. Even if the President comes--

00:10:47.485 --> 00:10:48.619
Hey, are you working?

00:10:50.755 --> 00:10:52.156
Oh, hello, sir.

00:10:52.223 --> 00:10:53.157
Hello, sir.

00:10:53.224 --> 00:10:54.792
I came to check on Hope.

00:10:54.859 --> 00:10:56.026
Let me take you.

00:10:56.093 --> 00:10:57.461
-This way.
-Yes, please.

00:10:57.528 --> 00:10:59.363
-A gift for you.
-Thank you.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.731
Hey, how's it going?

00:11:00.798 --> 00:11:01.665
Hello, sir.

00:11:01.732 --> 00:11:03.501
Are things okay at the President's home?

00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:05.002
For now, nothing has changed.

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:06.270
I see.

00:11:06.337 --> 00:11:08.739
But thanks to this,
I'm more motivated now.

00:11:08.806 --> 00:11:10.908
I want to make him win no matter what.

00:11:10.975 --> 00:11:13.310
Let's win and hush the hecklers.

00:11:13.377 --> 00:11:14.411
Yes!

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.748
They call him the Slow-Start King.

00:11:17.815 --> 00:11:19.717
He lacks motivation.

00:11:19.784 --> 00:11:21.619
I need to find a way to get him going.

00:11:22.186 --> 00:11:23.954
Maybe he dislikes blondes.

00:11:24.021 --> 00:11:25.156
Shut up.

00:11:25.689 --> 00:11:26.757
Well, thank you.

00:11:27.792 --> 00:11:29.326
Good morning.

00:11:31.796 --> 00:11:32.897
Is the President all right?

00:11:33.564 --> 00:11:35.032
Sorry.

00:11:35.533 --> 00:11:36.801
He's getting by.

00:11:38.002 --> 00:11:39.470
This won't bring him down.

00:11:39.537 --> 00:11:41.939
Mr. Hironaka said he's more motivated now.

00:11:42.006 --> 00:11:43.641
Oh, that's good.

00:11:44.275 --> 00:11:45.709
I'm motivated too.

00:11:45.776 --> 00:11:47.845
If we don't win, Hope will be ridiculed.

00:11:48.913 --> 00:11:50.681
You're absolutely right.

00:11:54.418 --> 00:11:56.720
I want my horse to win.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.358
That's the only way

00:12:02.293 --> 00:12:05.963
to make a racehorse happy.

00:12:06.864 --> 00:12:07.698
Yes.

00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:10.568
First, the Fuyo Stakes.

00:12:11.502 --> 00:12:13.404
Our next target is a G3.

00:12:13.971 --> 00:12:15.372
The Tokyo Sports Hai.

00:12:16.006 --> 00:12:18.442
If we win here,
we'll have a chance next year.

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:21.812
The 2014 Fuyo Stakes race!
This year, it's being held in Niigata.

00:12:21.879 --> 00:12:22.880
What happened?

00:12:22.947 --> 00:12:25.983
Please tell me
you didn't cause a scandal too.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.852
I'm doing this for Hope.

00:12:27.918 --> 00:12:29.720
To motivate him at the gates.

00:12:29.787 --> 00:12:30.621
I see.

00:12:31.222 --> 00:12:34.458
But with your hair like this,
you look like a fine young man.

00:12:34.525 --> 00:12:36.327
I've always been one!

00:12:36.393 --> 00:12:37.328
Now!

00:12:37.928 --> 00:12:40.764
I got these new dapper jockey silks too.

00:12:40.831 --> 00:12:42.233
Let's start fresh.

00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:44.401
Slow out of the gate again!
Hope's slow start!

00:12:44.468 --> 00:12:46.770
He wins even with a late start!
The crowd cheers!

00:12:46.837 --> 00:12:48.305
Royal Hope is fierce!

00:12:48.372 --> 00:12:51.275
The skies of Niigata welcome
Ryujiro Saki with the black helmet!

00:12:51.342 --> 00:12:55.980
This fall, Royal Hope also took
first place in the G3, Tokyo Sports Hai,

00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:58.449
steadily gaining him
the trust of horse racing fans.

00:12:58.515 --> 00:12:59.884
Interesting.

00:13:00.517 --> 00:13:03.888
With this momentum, the Royal Family
aims for next year's G1 races.

00:13:03.954 --> 00:13:05.823
Even with a bad start…

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.927
The Satsuki Sho, the Japan Derby,
and the Kikuka Sho.

00:13:09.994 --> 00:13:13.063
As beyond those three
lies the Arima Kinen.

00:13:15.099 --> 00:13:16.400
It's me, Kurisu.

00:13:17.101 --> 00:13:18.269
Oh, hi.

00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:22.273
I found it.

00:13:22.339 --> 00:13:23.807
Thank you.

00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:24.942
It's nothing.

00:13:30.314 --> 00:13:33.417
The horse seems to be doing well.

00:13:34.184 --> 00:13:35.619
Thankfully.

00:13:35.686 --> 00:13:37.254
A long time ago,

00:13:38.622 --> 00:13:42.126
the President took me
all the way to Hokkaido

00:13:43.093 --> 00:13:46.196
and forced me to choose a horse.

00:13:46.263 --> 00:13:47.097
Oh, really?

00:13:47.164 --> 00:13:48.299
Just one horse.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:54.672
I told him, "It's so expensive,
I can't take responsibility for it."

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.441
What was the horse's name?

00:13:59.243 --> 00:14:00.978
Royal Happiness.

00:14:02.947 --> 00:14:04.982
He never let us see her.

00:14:05.049 --> 00:14:08.085
He never lets us see the good parts!

00:14:08.152 --> 00:14:10.154
You're weird, Dad.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.389
You're the ones that never came
when I asked you to!

00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:14.058
What?

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.564
Happiness is still living well
at a ranch in Hokkaido.

00:14:21.165 --> 00:14:22.399
Is that so?

00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:25.336
She's a respectable mother now.

00:14:29.707 --> 00:14:31.442
My Koichi,

00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:35.980
what club do you think
he joined at university?

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.548
Well…

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.251
The Horse Racing Research Club.

00:14:42.619 --> 00:14:43.454
What?

00:14:46.724 --> 00:14:47.858
Koichi!

00:14:47.925 --> 00:14:52.830
I still haven't told him about his father.

00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:57.501
But one day, I saw him
earnestly working on something.

00:14:57.568 --> 00:14:58.569
How was your day?

00:14:58.635 --> 00:15:02.639
And he was entering
horse data into his computer.

00:15:04.842 --> 00:15:06.377
Children…

00:15:07.511 --> 00:15:11.515
They never fail to surprise us.

00:15:11.582 --> 00:15:12.416
Yes.

00:15:14.284 --> 00:15:17.054
Seeing him grow up
and become a fine young man

00:15:17.588 --> 00:15:19.289
has brought me great joy.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.991
Take care.

00:15:33.871 --> 00:15:35.639
-Why the sudden visit?
-Nothing.

00:15:35.706 --> 00:15:37.841
-Just wanted to see her.
-Oh.

00:15:40.577 --> 00:15:41.645
Shohei.

00:15:46.817 --> 00:15:49.420
-I actually want to show her to someone.
-Oh, okay.

00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:53.223
Okay, taking a picture.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.225
-Look your best, okay?
-Happiness!

00:15:55.959 --> 00:15:56.927
I see.

00:15:56.994 --> 00:15:58.829
So Happiness had such a history.

00:15:58.896 --> 00:15:59.863
Yes.

00:16:00.497 --> 00:16:01.932
We have to cherish it.

00:16:02.966 --> 00:16:03.934
Yes.

00:16:04.835 --> 00:16:05.803
But…

00:16:06.937 --> 00:16:08.672
I'm a little hesitant now.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.576
Maybe I'm being a nuisance to Mikiko.

00:16:12.643 --> 00:16:13.844
No.

00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:16.713
If she really didn't want it,
she could refuse.

00:16:18.348 --> 00:16:19.349
Yes.

00:16:19.416 --> 00:16:22.319
But your President is terrible.
He's garbage.

00:16:22.986 --> 00:16:23.921
Garbage?

00:16:23.987 --> 00:16:24.822
He is!

00:16:24.888 --> 00:16:28.358
If I were his wife, I would drag him
behind a horse and kill him.

00:16:29.393 --> 00:16:31.895
Now, about that Mikiko lady?

00:16:31.962 --> 00:16:36.200
If you were to say Ms. Mikiko
had an unhappy life, I wouldn't agree.

00:16:37.134 --> 00:16:41.605
When it comes to the past,
there are no mistakes or wrong choices.

00:16:42.506 --> 00:16:45.342
The path she walked
is the only correct answer.

00:16:46.643 --> 00:16:48.312
At least, that's what I believe.

00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:52.382
-Okay.
-So you shouldn't hesitate either.

00:16:53.717 --> 00:16:54.551
Yes.

00:16:55.085 --> 00:16:56.487
Understood.

00:16:57.454 --> 00:17:00.424
Her son is still a student, isn't he?

00:17:01.592 --> 00:17:03.260
It must be tough.

00:17:03.327 --> 00:17:04.394
Yes.

00:17:05.028 --> 00:17:09.399
To see the baby you once held
grow up to be taller than you…

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.669
And to keep watching over them…

00:17:13.203 --> 00:17:15.139
That is a mother's joy.

00:17:24.214 --> 00:17:25.983
-Sorry, I made you help out.
-It's fine.

00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:28.318
Horse Racing Club? Nice hobby.

00:17:28.385 --> 00:17:30.454
Be sure to guide Mr. Kurisu, okay?

00:17:30.521 --> 00:17:32.022
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:17:32.656 --> 00:17:35.259
All right, let's go!

00:17:35.325 --> 00:17:37.094
-I'm closing the door.
-Huh?

00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:44.034
See you later!

00:17:54.611 --> 00:17:57.181
What kind of person is Ryujiro Saki?

00:17:57.881 --> 00:17:59.149
What? Mr. Saki?

00:17:59.716 --> 00:18:01.118
What kind of person…

00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:02.819
I wonder.

00:18:03.487 --> 00:18:04.388
Is he a genius?

00:18:07.457 --> 00:18:11.361
To me, all winning jockeys
look like geniuses.

00:18:11.929 --> 00:18:14.231
But I think Mr. Saki is especially unique.

00:18:14.298 --> 00:18:16.233
He's good at befriending horses.

00:18:16.867 --> 00:18:19.303
He got along with Hope instantly.

00:18:21.071 --> 00:18:24.441
Maybe it's because he has lived
with horses since he was little.

00:18:24.942 --> 00:18:26.977
Like you, Shohei.

00:18:31.648 --> 00:18:34.484
Can you get his autograph?

00:18:35.252 --> 00:18:36.720
Autograph?

00:18:36.787 --> 00:18:38.722
Of course, I'll ask him!

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.258
Please get it for me.

00:18:41.325 --> 00:18:44.361
Oh, I'm so happy!

00:18:44.428 --> 00:18:46.663
He's our main jockey, after all.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:51.368
Knowing that you are his fan
is really heartening.

00:18:51.969 --> 00:18:52.803
No.

00:18:53.337 --> 00:18:54.471
I'm not a fan.

00:18:55.038 --> 00:18:56.006
What?

00:18:57.841 --> 00:18:59.276
I want to surpass him.

00:19:03.647 --> 00:19:05.515
Please don't tell my mother.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.120
I am applying to the Horseracing School.

00:19:12.322 --> 00:19:14.291
I want to be Hope's jockey.

00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:18.128
That means I should be
better than Mr. Saki, right?

00:19:19.162 --> 00:19:23.467
So, I want to put it on my desk
to keep me focused.

00:19:31.742 --> 00:19:32.776
I'll wait here, okay?

00:19:45.922 --> 00:19:48.358
Seeing him grow up
and become a fine young man…

00:19:49.426 --> 00:19:51.595
And to keep watching over them…

00:19:51.662 --> 00:19:53.163
That is a mother's joy.

00:20:04.074 --> 00:20:07.744
Mothers really are amazing.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.791
Here you go.

00:21:21.184 --> 00:21:22.419
I am sorry…

00:21:24.554 --> 00:21:26.590
for all the trouble I caused.

00:21:29.993 --> 00:21:31.027
It's okay.

00:21:32.229 --> 00:21:33.630
Things are quiet now.

00:21:46.576 --> 00:21:48.812
I gave birth to him on my own.

00:21:50.814 --> 00:21:52.916
-I didn't think we would meet again--
-Listen.

00:21:54.918 --> 00:21:57.020
I hate horses.

00:21:59.222 --> 00:22:05.061
Maybe that's why every time I go see
Sanno's horses race, he always loses.

00:22:06.096 --> 00:22:07.697
When that happens,

00:22:07.764 --> 00:22:11.601
I eventually feel like
it's my fault they lost.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.172
And I hate them even more.

00:22:18.508 --> 00:22:19.876
It's foolish, isn't it?

00:22:22.779 --> 00:22:26.950
The horses don't care about me at all.

00:22:27.017 --> 00:22:28.552
It's all in my head.

00:22:33.757 --> 00:22:36.660
Did you ever go to the races with him?

00:22:38.862 --> 00:22:39.930
I did.

00:22:40.797 --> 00:22:41.631
Is that so?

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.768
Did he win then?

00:22:46.703 --> 00:22:47.771
No.

00:22:49.739 --> 00:22:51.842
His horses were weak.

00:22:59.349 --> 00:23:00.717
How rude.

00:23:16.333 --> 00:23:17.868
She was interesting.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.947
Back at the Yayoi Sho in March,
Hope finished second.

00:23:31.014 --> 00:23:33.750
It secured him priority entry
at the Satsuki Sho, the first race

00:23:33.817 --> 00:23:35.252
of the Classic Triple Crown.

00:23:35.318 --> 00:23:37.621
Let's see how the Slow-Start King fares!

00:23:38.321 --> 00:23:40.023
First race of the Classic Triple Crown!

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.026
Hope will finally run in a G1 race.

00:23:44.461 --> 00:23:45.729
Valshare is coming up!

00:23:45.795 --> 00:23:48.965
Valshare bursts ahead
and crosses the finish line!

00:23:49.032 --> 00:23:50.467
Yes!

00:23:50.534 --> 00:23:52.636
However, he finished 16th.

00:23:52.702 --> 00:23:55.338
This crushing defeat
betrayed the expectations

00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:56.973
put on him as the favorite.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.208
Next is Gaspard Marilyn…

00:23:58.275 --> 00:24:00.544
We still have a long way to go.

00:24:02.479 --> 00:24:03.480
President?

00:24:04.114 --> 00:24:04.948
President!

00:24:05.515 --> 00:24:07.017
Hey!

00:24:07.951 --> 00:24:08.785
President.

00:24:08.852 --> 00:24:09.753
Any plans tonight?

00:24:11.888 --> 00:24:13.523
-A party?
-Not today.

00:24:14.024 --> 00:24:15.258
What do you need?

00:24:15.959 --> 00:24:18.995
Why don't we have a meal together?

00:24:20.096 --> 00:24:21.031
What?

00:24:22.032 --> 00:24:23.867
I've been wanting to talk to you.

00:24:25.835 --> 00:24:28.238
No, sorry sir, but he isn't free today.

00:24:28.305 --> 00:24:29.472
It's fine.

00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:32.442
I'll be happy to.

00:24:37.514 --> 00:24:39.749
I'm surprised, though.

00:24:39.816 --> 00:24:42.485
Who knew you were a lightweight
like this guy?

00:24:42.552 --> 00:24:43.687
Sorry.

00:24:44.788 --> 00:24:46.856
I'll pour the next one.

00:24:46.923 --> 00:24:50.093
It's fine. No need for formalities.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.995
-However…
-Excuse me.

00:24:52.062 --> 00:24:54.497
If a fight breaks out,
cover me with your body.

00:25:01.771 --> 00:25:02.906
Still…

00:25:03.506 --> 00:25:06.042
Valshare was great today.

00:25:08.578 --> 00:25:10.847
I believe they call that "flawless."

00:25:10.914 --> 00:25:11.948
We were just lucky.

00:25:12.015 --> 00:25:14.217
You call that win good luck?

00:25:14.818 --> 00:25:17.220
You plan to take
the remaining Classics, right?

00:25:17.821 --> 00:25:19.222
It won't be that easy.

00:25:19.956 --> 00:25:23.426
I mean, Valshare is
the strongest horse you've got.

00:25:24.027 --> 00:25:28.031
Although, My Hope beat him once.

00:25:29.432 --> 00:25:31.468
What? What is it?

00:25:31.534 --> 00:25:33.036
-Don't, sir.
-Why?

00:25:33.103 --> 00:25:35.872
-Excuse me.
-Indeed, Hope is a good horse.

00:25:36.606 --> 00:25:38.942
A kind that I could never find.

00:25:39.009 --> 00:25:40.010
Yes.

00:25:40.977 --> 00:25:45.448
Even if he was put up for auction,
you would never even look at him.

00:25:47.317 --> 00:25:50.220
You must have studied
his pedigree quite a bit.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.857
A decent horse
with an element of surprise.

00:25:53.923 --> 00:25:58.862
Such a horse
can even change future trends.

00:25:59.562 --> 00:26:00.563
But?

00:26:02.766 --> 00:26:04.134
But what?

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.802
You want to say more, right?

00:26:05.869 --> 00:26:08.772
-Like, "But our horse still won't lose."
-President!

00:26:09.539 --> 00:26:11.007
I never said such a thing.

00:26:11.808 --> 00:26:15.412
No, your face says it all.

00:26:16.813 --> 00:26:20.750
When I talk about Valshare,
I can't keep a calm face.

00:26:21.551 --> 00:26:23.420
I can't help but despise him.

00:26:23.486 --> 00:26:25.655
He's always getting in the way.

00:26:26.423 --> 00:26:28.491
I wish that horse would just disappear.

00:26:34.831 --> 00:26:35.932
I see.

00:26:37.801 --> 00:26:40.336
Everyone, let's eat
before the food gets cold--

00:26:40.403 --> 00:26:42.038
Then I will say it.

00:26:43.873 --> 00:26:47.243
Indeed, Royal Hope is a good horse.

00:26:48.545 --> 00:26:50.046
-But--
-Here it comes.

00:26:50.113 --> 00:26:51.648
-But what?
-But…

00:26:52.282 --> 00:26:54.584
Our horse will never lose to him again.

00:26:55.585 --> 00:26:58.288
Speed, stamina, senses, and early pace.

00:26:58.855 --> 00:27:02.492
In every aspect,
there's no reason for Valshare to lose.

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:04.227
Speed, stamina.

00:27:04.294 --> 00:27:06.696
You're talking about quite a small scale.

00:27:07.597 --> 00:27:10.967
A horse is a living creature.
A race is a living thing too.

00:27:11.034 --> 00:27:12.669
Speed, stamina…

00:27:12.736 --> 00:27:15.338
A truly strong horse
exists beyond such logic!

00:27:15.405 --> 00:27:16.973
That is far too simplistic.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.675
Numbers are reality.

00:27:18.742 --> 00:27:21.578
If you base your tactics
on such blind faith,

00:27:22.545 --> 00:27:26.449
then your horse of some
no-name pedigree cannot win.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.919
Right, now he calls Hope a no-name.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.224
Do you think I don't hate Royal Hope?

00:27:35.024 --> 00:27:38.895
Valshare lost to your horse
on his big stage, his debut race.

00:27:40.797 --> 00:27:44.067
I will never forget the cheers
from the stands that day.

00:27:44.667 --> 00:27:50.273
That excitement,
as if they were hoping for us to lose.

00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:57.480
At that moment, I swore I would
never lose to Royal Hope again.

00:27:57.547 --> 00:27:59.382
Not Royal Hope.

00:28:01.417 --> 00:28:02.786
That's what I decided.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.591
You're truly a fox.

00:28:09.359 --> 00:28:10.360
This is the real you.

00:28:12.295 --> 00:28:13.863
Take from this what you want.

00:28:20.537 --> 00:28:23.573
Eat up! You guys barely ate at all.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.074
No, but…

00:28:25.775 --> 00:28:26.943
I can't…

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:30.947
KOMATSU-YA

00:28:31.014 --> 00:28:32.682
Thank you for tonight.

00:28:33.516 --> 00:28:35.552
-See you at the racecourse.
-Yes.

00:28:39.722 --> 00:28:40.790
Go ahead.

00:28:45.762 --> 00:28:47.163
I'll go flag a taxi.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.298
Hey.

00:28:49.065 --> 00:28:50.967
Can I ask you one thing?

00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:53.236
Yes. What is it?

00:28:54.404 --> 00:28:57.774
Why has Sanno never won a G1?

00:28:59.175 --> 00:29:01.110
Where are we going wrong?

00:29:02.312 --> 00:29:05.782
In horse racing,
there's something called "momentum."

00:29:06.816 --> 00:29:07.917
Don't worry.

00:29:08.618 --> 00:29:11.788
I think Mr. Sanno will win soon.

00:29:12.355 --> 00:29:13.623
This is not flattery.

00:29:21.431 --> 00:29:23.733
Just please stay out of our way.

00:29:32.542 --> 00:29:33.943
Long-term use is okay.

00:29:35.778 --> 00:29:38.414
That hurt! Hope!

00:29:39.015 --> 00:29:40.250
He's biting again.

00:29:40.316 --> 00:29:42.585
Should we try
taking the blinders off a while?

00:29:43.286 --> 00:29:44.854
I'm by the sea.

00:29:45.588 --> 00:29:46.456
Can you see it?

00:29:47.056 --> 00:29:49.025
Where?

00:29:49.659 --> 00:29:50.593
Hey!

00:29:51.494 --> 00:29:53.463
Oh, there you are! Kanako!

00:29:54.297 --> 00:29:56.599
I just got a call. It's decided.

00:29:56.666 --> 00:29:58.601
He's running in the Japan Derby!

00:29:58.668 --> 00:30:02.605
Really? Wow! We did it!

00:30:02.672 --> 00:30:04.807
If we win, we'll be number one in Japan!

00:30:04.874 --> 00:30:06.109
Number one!

00:30:06.175 --> 00:30:07.510
Number one!

00:30:08.811 --> 00:30:09.846
Amazing!

00:30:10.713 --> 00:30:13.349
Are you inviting Ms. Nakajo to the derby?

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.118
No…

00:30:15.718 --> 00:30:17.587
That might be difficult.

00:30:18.621 --> 00:30:20.523
She said she would cheer
from the hospital.

00:30:24.694 --> 00:30:25.528
I want to win.

00:30:26.496 --> 00:30:27.563
Yeah.

00:30:29.432 --> 00:30:31.935
It's strange.

00:30:33.369 --> 00:30:36.739
We never talked
about horses before, right?

00:30:37.273 --> 00:30:38.107
Yes.

00:30:38.641 --> 00:30:41.644
And now, we're crazy about horses.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.214
Life is unpredictable.

00:30:46.849 --> 00:30:50.987
I never thought we would even talk again.

00:30:52.855 --> 00:30:53.690
True.

00:30:57.093 --> 00:30:59.028
We've known each other for so long.

00:31:04.701 --> 00:31:06.069
Hey, if…

00:31:07.704 --> 00:31:10.707
If at the derby, Hope wins…

00:31:13.076 --> 00:31:14.544
If he wins…

00:31:20.049 --> 00:31:21.451
-Could we…
-Then what?

00:31:21.517 --> 00:31:23.920
Will you treat me to something?

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:29.459
Well, I will do that,
but that's not the point.

00:31:29.525 --> 00:31:32.962
Oh, that's right.
Shohei said he wanted a new bicycle.

00:31:34.163 --> 00:31:35.999
Oh, a bicycle?

00:31:36.065 --> 00:31:38.634
Well, a bike is fine.

00:31:39.702 --> 00:31:41.204
Hey, you want to look around?

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:42.205
Sure.

00:31:45.675 --> 00:31:46.943
Seriously…

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:49.879
This is the final wall before Arima.

00:31:49.946 --> 00:31:55.385
Soon after, they learned that
Valshare would also be at the derby.

00:31:56.486 --> 00:31:58.821
A toast to victory at the derby! Cheers!

00:31:58.888 --> 00:32:00.356
-Cheers.
-Let me take your jacket.

00:32:00.423 --> 00:32:01.858
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

00:32:01.924 --> 00:32:03.493
-Okay, cheers.
-Cheers.

00:32:04.127 --> 00:32:05.328
Thank you.

00:32:06.696 --> 00:32:09.332
Wait! I haven't got a drink yet!

00:32:09.399 --> 00:32:10.500
Oh, sorry.

00:32:10.566 --> 00:32:12.402
We can't wait when it comes to alcohol.

00:32:12.468 --> 00:32:14.103
Mr. Kurisu, you don't drink, right?

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.506
I try to gulp it down
just for times like this.

00:32:16.572 --> 00:32:18.441
-Good evening.
-Welcome.

00:32:19.042 --> 00:32:20.743
Then let's do one more, with me.

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:22.645
Oh, sorry. I'm done.

00:32:22.712 --> 00:32:24.680
-What?
-He's a jockey, so…

00:32:25.381 --> 00:32:27.383
-Cancel the Tempura Kiss and…
-Tea is fine.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:29.619
-Toast with tea.
-You two are so in sync.

00:32:30.253 --> 00:32:31.320
You should date.

00:32:32.188 --> 00:32:34.690
-Stop that.
-I wish the President was here too.

00:32:34.757 --> 00:32:36.926
No! Then he'll kick me out!

00:32:37.593 --> 00:32:40.063
The President seemed tired, so not today.

00:32:42.665 --> 00:32:46.102
Between work and horses, it's tough.
He does well for his age.

00:32:46.169 --> 00:32:48.337
Right? And his private life too.

00:32:48.938 --> 00:32:51.007
-Oh!
-Hey!

00:32:51.641 --> 00:32:54.077
-Can't I?
-No.

00:32:54.744 --> 00:32:56.846
You're his daughter, you can say it.

00:32:58.014 --> 00:33:01.350
No way, do all of you
have secret kids too?

00:33:01.417 --> 00:33:03.920
-No!
-No way.

00:33:03.986 --> 00:33:05.054
Today is fun.

00:33:07.957 --> 00:33:09.058
A while back,

00:33:10.359 --> 00:33:13.663
I had a fight with a big deal trainer.

00:33:14.897 --> 00:33:17.600
I was hung out to dry,

00:33:18.267 --> 00:33:22.638
but the President intervened,
then angrily scolded me.

00:33:23.406 --> 00:33:25.675
"You must try to smile,
even if it's fake."

00:33:28.478 --> 00:33:30.646
After I did that, work became fun.

00:33:31.848 --> 00:33:34.584
-That's how he charms people.
-It's not like that.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.053
Hey, are you listening?
He just told a good story.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.087
That's right.

00:33:38.154 --> 00:33:42.125
I also won't forgive anyone
who speaks ill of the President.

00:33:43.025 --> 00:33:46.662
Some people even say that a horse
bought by Royal has no future.

00:33:47.196 --> 00:33:51.100
No, but, he has owned horses
for more than ten years!

00:33:51.167 --> 00:33:52.869
That alone is admirable.

00:33:52.935 --> 00:33:55.338
They keep criticizing the losses.

00:33:55.404 --> 00:33:59.542
I wouldn't be racing Nationals
if it weren't for the President.

00:34:00.576 --> 00:34:01.410
All right!

00:34:01.477 --> 00:34:03.880
Let's make the President a derby winner.

00:34:03.946 --> 00:34:05.381
All right!

00:34:05.448 --> 00:34:07.016
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:34:07.083 --> 00:34:08.150
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:34:11.087 --> 00:34:12.388
Are you okay?

00:34:13.022 --> 00:34:14.590
I'm used to it.

00:34:15.658 --> 00:34:17.226
It's late already.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.495
You should go home and study.

00:34:19.562 --> 00:34:20.730
It's fine. Oh, sorry.

00:34:20.796 --> 00:34:24.100
-Don't you have homework?
-I don't. I'm not in high school anymore.

00:34:24.667 --> 00:34:26.068
Maybe reports to write?

00:34:26.135 --> 00:34:27.603
I'm on top of everything.

00:34:28.704 --> 00:34:30.106
I see.

00:34:33.543 --> 00:34:34.510
I'll come again.

00:34:35.177 --> 00:34:36.546
Don't push yourself.

00:34:36.612 --> 00:34:37.813
I'm not.

00:34:44.654 --> 00:34:46.656
EIJI KURISU

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.129
Oh, I have to see that.

00:34:53.196 --> 00:34:54.463
Okay, got it.

00:34:55.031 --> 00:34:57.533
So? Are you watching?

00:34:59.035 --> 00:35:00.469
I am.

00:35:01.737 --> 00:35:03.306
Do you like our Hope?

00:35:05.007 --> 00:35:06.409
I don't know…

00:35:06.475 --> 00:35:09.111
Stop!

00:35:11.047 --> 00:35:12.815
The weather is nice. Thank you.

00:35:12.882 --> 00:35:15.351
Which horse do you like?
I'll buy you a betting ticket.

00:35:15.952 --> 00:35:17.486
No need to be polite.

00:35:18.187 --> 00:35:19.722
Tell me what you think.

00:35:20.389 --> 00:35:21.657
I want your opinion.

00:35:29.532 --> 00:35:30.499
I see.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.903
Tokyo Racecourse, Race Ten,
the Tokyo Yushun.

00:35:34.437 --> 00:35:38.608
The 82nd Japan Derby G1,
Turf 2,400 meters.

00:35:38.674 --> 00:35:40.743
Oh, the Royal Family.

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:44.447
Introducing the 17 horses
who have made it this year…

00:35:44.513 --> 00:35:48.017
-Number One, Royal Hope, 428kg…
-Turn left at that sign.

00:35:48.084 --> 00:35:50.786
How long has it…
How many years has it been?

00:35:50.853 --> 00:35:53.022
No kidding!

00:35:54.023 --> 00:35:56.525
Are you feeling uneasy?

00:35:57.093 --> 00:36:00.396
…minus 4kg, Mitsuki Matsuda.

00:36:00.463 --> 00:36:02.732
Number Eight Coffee Rest…

00:36:02.798 --> 00:36:05.868
-Look, they even have drinks.
-I'll get a beer too.

00:36:05.935 --> 00:36:07.436
Your lawyer sent this.

00:36:07.503 --> 00:36:11.140
It's about dividing
our assets in the future.

00:36:14.243 --> 00:36:19.081
Don't ever think you'll be able
to leave money to your secret child.

00:36:32.828 --> 00:36:34.530
Hey, over here!

00:36:39.669 --> 00:36:44.106
The Maritime Self-Defense Force Tokyo Band
here to signal the start of the race.

00:36:44.173 --> 00:36:47.543
And the applause of the fans
has returned to Derby Day this year.

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:48.544
You okay?

00:36:48.611 --> 00:36:49.845
I'm fine!

00:36:49.912 --> 00:36:52.148
-The 82nd Japan Derby G1…
-It seems fun.

00:36:52.214 --> 00:36:53.616
2,400 meters on turf.

00:36:53.683 --> 00:36:55.084
What do you think, Koichi?

00:36:55.785 --> 00:36:57.620
Valshare is the clear favorite.

00:36:58.521 --> 00:36:59.355
But…

00:36:59.922 --> 00:37:00.990
But?

00:37:02.191 --> 00:37:04.126
I'm cheering for

00:37:04.994 --> 00:37:06.462
Royal Hope.

00:37:07.563 --> 00:37:08.664
Oh really?

00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:10.166
We have a 17-horse Japan Derby.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.503
Number One, Royal Hope,
known for sharp boosts of speed.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:18.207
-He's being guided to the gate.
-He has grown a lot.

00:37:18.941 --> 00:37:22.545
Satsuki Sho winner Valshare
is entering at gate Number Ten.

00:37:23.245 --> 00:37:24.613
And on the derby stage,

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.116
aiming for the first filly victory
in eight years…

00:37:27.183 --> 00:37:28.017
Hope bit you?

00:37:28.084 --> 00:37:30.086
-He did.
-As per usual then.

00:37:30.152 --> 00:37:31.620
They are headed to the gate.

00:37:31.687 --> 00:37:34.824
The once-in-a-lifetime showpiece
for the three-year-olds.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.093
No one will ever forget this.

00:37:37.159 --> 00:37:39.428
It's a once-in-a-lifetime moment.

00:37:40.296 --> 00:37:41.230
The final horse is…

00:37:41.297 --> 00:37:44.033
-Finally.
-Number 17, Bestet Line.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:48.838
Guided by the attendant,
he is now slowly entering the gate!

00:38:00.082 --> 00:38:01.016
Go!

00:38:02.752 --> 00:38:03.686
Come on!

00:38:04.253 --> 00:38:05.721
Hope!

00:38:09.258 --> 00:38:12.928
-They're off! The 82nd Japan Derby!
-Yes!

00:38:12.995 --> 00:38:14.597
There's Hope!

00:38:15.464 --> 00:38:18.334
-All horses got a good start.
-Come on, Hope!

00:38:18.401 --> 00:38:20.102
Heading towards the first corner.

00:38:20.169 --> 00:38:21.270
Go!

00:38:21.337 --> 00:38:23.372
Battling for the lead, from the outside,

00:38:23.439 --> 00:38:26.575
Number 17, Bestet Line
has taken the lead as expected.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.845
Following is Number 14, Daikoku Hunter.

00:38:29.912 --> 00:38:33.315
Number One, Royal Hope is third,
with a white helmet.

00:38:33.382 --> 00:38:36.185
Royal Hope takes the inside track
in third position.

00:38:36.252 --> 00:38:38.954
They are now moving
from the first to the second corner.

00:38:39.021 --> 00:38:41.757
Number Two, Vactifame,
then Number Seven, Gladius,

00:38:41.824 --> 00:38:43.058
and Number Six, Bible.

00:38:43.125 --> 00:38:45.294
They head down
the backstretch in a long line,

00:38:45.361 --> 00:38:46.962
maintaining
a two-to three-length distance.

00:38:47.029 --> 00:38:50.366
On the inside, in the white helmet,
is Number One, Royal Hope.

00:38:50.433 --> 00:38:53.702
Here is Royal Hope,
followed by Number Ten, Valshare.

00:38:53.769 --> 00:38:56.439
Fan favorite Valshare is in the middle,
moving to the outside…

00:38:56.505 --> 00:38:57.840
Valshare!

00:38:57.907 --> 00:39:00.009
-Inside is Number Six, Bible…
-Do your best!

00:39:00.075 --> 00:39:01.677
-Valshare!
-Hope!

00:39:01.744 --> 00:39:03.345
-Valshare!
-I'm so grateful!

00:39:03.412 --> 00:39:04.513
Hope!

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.416
A length back,
three to four horses are clustered up!

00:39:07.483 --> 00:39:10.853
The last horse, trailing alone,
is Number Four, Leg Gentle.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.456
The horses are now heading
towards the third corner.

00:39:13.522 --> 00:39:15.357
-And Number One, Royal Hope…
-Go!

00:39:15.424 --> 00:39:17.059
-They are on the move!
-Go, Hope!

00:39:17.827 --> 00:39:18.861
Go!

00:39:20.896 --> 00:39:24.366
-They pass the Zelkova tree! Number One…
-This is it.

00:39:24.433 --> 00:39:27.236
-Royal Hope is moving up on the outside.
-Now, it begins.

00:39:27.303 --> 00:39:29.338
Royal Hope smoothly advances!

00:39:29.405 --> 00:39:31.340
The leader is Number 17, Bestet Line.

00:39:31.407 --> 00:39:34.477
Last curve of the fourth corner,
passing the 600-meter marker.

00:39:34.543 --> 00:39:35.211
Come on!

00:39:35.277 --> 00:39:38.180
The leaders have spread out
across the track!

00:39:38.247 --> 00:39:42.284
-The horses are in the long homestretch…
-It's anyone's game now.

00:39:42.351 --> 00:39:44.386
The 17 champions of this year!

00:39:44.453 --> 00:39:46.655
Almost side by side!

00:39:46.722 --> 00:39:48.924
Passing the 400-meter marker!

00:39:48.991 --> 00:39:50.960
Now, from the pack, the white helmet.

00:39:51.026 --> 00:39:52.795
-Royal Hope has emerged!
-Yes!

00:39:52.862 --> 00:39:56.699
-All right. Go!
-From the middle of the pack, Hope soars!

00:39:56.765 --> 00:39:58.868
-Hope!
-The star of Hidaka, Royal Hope!

00:39:58.934 --> 00:40:01.804
Ryujiro Saki, he won't let go
of the reins now!

00:40:03.606 --> 00:40:04.773
Come on!

00:40:05.274 --> 00:40:06.976
-Go!
-Go, come on!

00:40:07.042 --> 00:40:08.777
Here Kitamura makes his move!

00:40:08.844 --> 00:40:09.845
Number Ten, Valshare!

00:40:09.912 --> 00:40:11.347
-Please.
-Valshare!

00:40:11.413 --> 00:40:13.382
The Satsuki Sho winner coming through!

00:40:13.449 --> 00:40:16.151
The yellow helmet, Number Ten,
Valshare, and Royal Hope!

00:40:16.218 --> 00:40:18.187
-It's Kitamura!
-Pass him!

00:40:18.254 --> 00:40:19.955
-Hang on!
-Do your best!

00:40:20.022 --> 00:40:21.357
-Hope!
-Kitamura has…

00:40:21.423 --> 00:40:22.992
-Go, Hope!
-Kitamura is advancing…

00:40:23.058 --> 00:40:23.792
Come on!

00:40:23.859 --> 00:40:27.096
The once-in-a-lifetime race
for the three-year-olds!

00:40:27.162 --> 00:40:29.031
Passing the 200-meter mark!

00:40:29.098 --> 00:40:30.332
-Royal Hope!
-Go!

00:40:30.399 --> 00:40:31.433
-Or Valshare?
-Go!

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.002
-Run!
-Who will win this year…

00:40:33.068 --> 00:40:34.637
-Keep going!
-Hope!

00:40:34.703 --> 00:40:37.373
They're side by side!
Side by side! Royal Hope…

00:40:37.439 --> 00:40:40.075
Valshare! They finish side by side!

00:40:40.576 --> 00:40:44.146
The Japan Derby!
This truly is Japan's number one race!

00:40:44.213 --> 00:40:46.882
Everyone is ecstatic!

00:40:46.949 --> 00:40:49.451
There is thunderous applause!

00:40:49.518 --> 00:40:53.422
Number One, Royal Hope took the lead
in the center of the track!

00:40:53.489 --> 00:40:56.759
Number Ten, Valshare,
came up from between horses.

00:40:56.825 --> 00:40:59.828
Tokyo Racecourse, Race Ten.

00:40:59.895 --> 00:41:02.598
Please wait as we review the footage.

00:41:02.665 --> 00:41:04.033
That was good.

00:41:05.467 --> 00:41:08.103
That was a good race.

00:41:11.473 --> 00:41:13.976
Tokyo Racecourse, Race Ten.

00:41:17.046 --> 00:41:19.315
First place, Number Ten.

00:41:19.381 --> 00:41:21.450
The confirmed result mark has now lit up.

00:41:21.517 --> 00:41:23.319
First place is Number Ten, Valshare!

00:41:23.385 --> 00:41:25.287
He lived up to his status as favorite.

00:41:25.354 --> 00:41:28.624
He has brilliantly won the Satsuki Sho
and Japan Derby double crown!

00:41:28.691 --> 00:41:31.126
-Royal Hope finished second!
-I'm glad.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:34.830
I don't want good memories of this place.

00:41:36.298 --> 00:41:38.534
This is enough.

00:41:52.815 --> 00:41:54.183
Koichi.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.119
I must tell you something.

00:41:59.855 --> 00:42:03.892
Royal Hope, and that Number Ten horse.

00:42:03.959 --> 00:42:05.527
A quinella bet, please.

00:42:05.594 --> 00:42:06.962
A quinella bet, huh?

00:42:08.163 --> 00:42:10.466
You even guessed that he would lose.

00:42:12.067 --> 00:42:13.936
You're one heck of a woman.

00:42:14.003 --> 00:42:17.740
MIKIKO NAKAJO

00:42:17.806 --> 00:42:23.512
MIKIKO NAKAJO FUNERAL VENUE

00:42:29.685 --> 00:42:30.853
Koichi.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:35.524
Yes.

00:42:40.896 --> 00:42:41.897
He's here.

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:51.974
Mr. Kurisu, I have a request.

00:42:55.044 --> 00:43:00.616
Please let Koichi and him meet each other.

00:43:03.018 --> 00:43:04.353
I'm sorry.

00:43:05.187 --> 00:43:07.423
I know this is a selfish request.

00:43:07.956 --> 00:43:12.227
I would like to offer my condolences,
and apologies.

00:43:14.163 --> 00:43:15.130
I am…

00:43:16.565 --> 00:43:18.701
from a company called Royal Human.

00:43:18.767 --> 00:43:21.203
I work as secretary
for the Horse Racing Division.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:22.404
I'm Eiji Kurisu.

00:43:24.039 --> 00:43:25.274
Thank you.

00:43:26.809 --> 00:43:30.679
When she was alive,
your mother entrusted me with a request.

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:32.781
I'm here to fulfill it.

00:43:33.348 --> 00:43:34.450
A request?

00:43:35.751 --> 00:43:36.952
For you, Koichi,

00:43:38.554 --> 00:43:40.155
to meet our company President,

00:43:41.356 --> 00:43:44.393
Kozo Sanno, who is over there.

00:43:49.665 --> 00:43:51.667
We don't intend to cause trouble.

00:43:52.434 --> 00:43:56.772
After a brief greeting,
we will leave right away.

00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:03.779
Up until a year ago,
I didn't know anything.

00:44:04.646 --> 00:44:05.814
I'm sorry.

00:44:06.682 --> 00:44:07.516
It's fine.

00:44:07.583 --> 00:44:08.917
About your future,

00:44:10.486 --> 00:44:12.221
he'll take care of everything.

00:44:12.855 --> 00:44:16.892
If you have any problems,
please let him know.

00:44:30.405 --> 00:44:32.274
Please accept this.

00:45:01.804 --> 00:45:03.038
I don't need this.

00:45:07.543 --> 00:45:10.312
Please don't come and see me again.

00:45:14.216 --> 00:45:17.953
I know you came all this way, but…

00:45:21.857 --> 00:45:23.892
We will never meet again.

00:45:23.959 --> 00:45:25.561
Please leave.

00:45:39.007 --> 00:45:41.076
We'll win the Arima.
Then Hope will retire.

00:45:41.143 --> 00:45:42.211
I'll quit too.

00:45:42.277 --> 00:45:43.946
Hope is retiring, isn't he?

00:45:44.012 --> 00:45:46.782
The man who brought us this far is you.

00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:49.051
That's the responsibility
of a man who talked about dreams!

00:45:49.117 --> 00:45:50.352
