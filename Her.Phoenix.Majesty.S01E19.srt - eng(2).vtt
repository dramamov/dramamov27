Shaoye

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.359
It's almost dawn.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:27.719
Why aren't you resting yet?

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.519
Staying up late will harm your health.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.240
I'm fine.

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:34.799
You know, these past two days,

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:37.600
Gongzhu has done a lot of hard work
for the villagers.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.000
But their prejudice against her
hasn't faded at all.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.000
If I don't do something,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.920
it'll never change.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.840
As long as her injustice remains,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.520
I can't find peace.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.880
I can't sleep well.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.280
But you've already done so much for her.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.920
She still barely acknowledges you.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:57.840
Let's not make things harder for ourselves.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:59.920
Let me teach you something.

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.039
A man should always finish what he starts.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.480
She may be a bit stubborn,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.680
but I think she's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.200
genuine and passionate.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:10.280
I believe

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.439
she will be Jincheng's wise ruler one day.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.920
Let's just do a good deed.

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:20.640
Shaoye

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.560
Please, have a drink.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.120
Gongzhu

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:28.599
Gongzhu

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:29.879
You're willing to see our Shaoye now?

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:30.719
Stop talking, just lead the way.

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:31.239
Alright.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.840
This way.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:39.719
Ruolin,

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.840
I wrote an opening, listen to it.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.799
Gongzhu got up early to carry firewood.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.079
She met Aunt Zhao on the way.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.680
You didn't make me look like a shrew, did you?

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.680
Gongzhu, why are you here?

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.719
How long do you plan to keep this from me?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.400
What am I hiding? I don't get it.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.599
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.719
And thank you for restoring my reputation.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:07.959
I only understand now

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.240
that to be a wise ruler,

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.680
one must love the people as their own children.

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.280
Sadly, I realized it too late.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.599
Now everyone is saying

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.199
Rong Heng rebelled

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:20.199
because I ordered it.

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.719
I went to Rong Heng's house a few days ago.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.840
But Princess Er had already surrounded it.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.199
So you've been investigating Rong Heng all along.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.319
I was deceived by Princess Er before.

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:37.919
I wrote poems slandering you.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.560
And

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.000
I even brought those letters to the palace.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:44.439
I believe

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.800
Princess Er is definitely involved in Rong Heng's rebellion.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.159
But if we find Rong Heng,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.360
we'll know her true motive.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.319
I see.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.319
Don't worry too much.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.280
Evil can't defeat good.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.879
I believe the truth will come out.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.919
I've left the palace many times,

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.520
but this is the first time I can't bear
to leave a house.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.960
After all,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.840
I cleaned it up myself.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.719
Let's go.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.639
I don't want to stay here anymore.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.599
Shaoye's house is so nice.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.800
Once we move there,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.080
I can even grow vegetables in the yard.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.039
You...

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.919
Let's go.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.080
Go.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.319
It's been ages since we drank together like this.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.080
How is it?

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.879
Tastes good.

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.079
I used to think

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.160
I wanted every man in the world

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:21.800
to admire me.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.800
Even to abduct them to the palace.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.360
Tie them all to myself.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.480
But I never imagined

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.759
I'd end up like this.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:34.560
It backfired.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.680
Luckily,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.639
you've always been by my side.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.920
Squat.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.240
Cross.

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:58.680
Throw.

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:00.279
Try again.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.040
Bend your knees a bit.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.240
Use your fingers with force.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.279
Left hand in a fist at your chest.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.160
Is it fun?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.199
Is it fun?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.360
Everyone has to do it this way.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.600
Gongzhu

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:26.800
I stewed chicken today.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.000
Come to my house for dinner tonight.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.360
What's so good about chicken?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.360
We stew fish at my house.

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:31.759
Come to my house.

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:32.800
Our food is nutritious.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.560
Come to our house.

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:35.439
The fish is fresh, come to my house.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.680
I'll handle things here.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.839
Go ahead, eat more.

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.839
Gongzhu

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.839
I'm here.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.839
You are...

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:48.439
Where is Gongzhu?

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.279
Guard Yang

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.800
Gongzhu

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:54.040
Gongzhu

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.079
You know each other?

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:56.759
Gongzhu

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:57.800
Are you saying

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.160
Rong Heng is locked in the southern camp's dungeon?

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.439
Absolutely true.

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:05.199
Don't worry.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.079
Guard Yang is one of us.

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:08.720
Guard Yang

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.279
Where did you get your information?

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.079
I was reassigned to the outskirts.

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.040
I met some sisters at the southern camp dungeon.

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:15.680
After drinking with them, I learned

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.959
they once guarded a mysterious assassin.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.279
That person was General Rong.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.560
Then why didn't you save her?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.480
Forgive me, Gongzhu.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.639
The day after General Rong was imprisoned,

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.040
all the guards were replaced by Princess Er's people.

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:29.439
I truly couldn't do anything.

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:36.759
Sit down.

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.759
Yes.

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.040
You see,

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:41.800
Guard Yang came from afar.

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:42.879
He must be hungry too.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.079
Let's eat first.

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:45.040
Then we'll have strength to save her.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:47.040
Eat.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.199
You've worked hard.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.439
Let's eat.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:50.360
Thank you, Gongzhu.

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.279
I take my leave.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.199
Gongzhu

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.160
Can we make the food less salty next time?

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:15.680
Back when I was in the palace,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.560
the dishes I made

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.240
were always finished completely.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:19.879
Looking back now,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.160
it must have been those officials

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.399
trying to please me as Gongzhu.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.480
They were deliberately flattering me.

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:26.319
Thinking about it now,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.240
they were either currying favor,

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:30.160
or forced back to the palace by me.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.240
Luckily,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.079
you've finally woken up.

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:35.160
You understand the people's hardships.

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:36.360
I think, given time,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.399
the people of Jincheng

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:38.879
I've thought of a way to save Rong Heng.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.759
I hid some jailer uniforms outside the palace.

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:44.680
We can disguise ourselves as jailers

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:46.040
and go to the prison to rescue Rong Heng.

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:47.519
Gongzhu,

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.439
how do you have jailer uniforms?

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.399
Yeah,

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:55.160
back then,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.800
after I rounded up all the handsome men,

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.600
I got playful for a moment

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:01.800
and wanted to visit the prison

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.879
to see the good-looking prisoners.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.040
Gongzhu,

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:06.199
your methods are truly unique.

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:07.759
You...

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:10.160
Shaoye,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.600
wait until the guards leave,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.680
then sneak in behind me.

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:31.079
I really wonder

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:32.799
why you'd come here to choose a consort.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.240
I told you, I was young and reckless.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.200
Who hasn't,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.759
done a few crazy things when young?

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:38.799
That's just twisted.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.279
There's a banquet in the palace today.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.240
The masters are in good spirits.

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:50.360
This is our reward.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.159
It's my turn now.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.200
Ladies,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.440
we're still playing.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.440
Look, the palace today

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.360
gave us fine wine and food.

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:09.480
Hurry,

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:10.559
come, drink!

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:11.759
Drink!

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:12.960
Smells really good.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.840
This dish is nice.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.080
Here, fill it up.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.200
Rong Heng.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.679
Rong Heng, are you there?

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:21.480
Gongzhu.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.000
Gongzhu.

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:24.320
Rong Heng.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.600
Rong Heng, Gongzhu.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.519
Rong Heng.

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:29.440
You've suffered.

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:31.960
It's all Rong Heng's fault.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.440
I made you fall from Gongzhu

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:36.200
to a commoner.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.480
I don't blame you.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:38.879
I know

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.440
you must have your own reasons.

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:41.879
Loser drinks!

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:42.720
I'll drink.

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:45.879
Bottoms up!

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:51.720
Another round!

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.519
Your turn now.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.440
Bottoms up!

00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:58.080
Keep it coming!

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.960
This wine smells great.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.279
Tell me the truth.

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:02.559
Who forced you to do this?

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:06.240
You should leave.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.120
If someone finds out...

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:07.960
Rong Heng.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.679
Was it Su Wan'er?
