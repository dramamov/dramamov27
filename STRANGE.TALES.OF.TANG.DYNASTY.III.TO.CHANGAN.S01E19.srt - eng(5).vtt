00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.290
he's not being honest.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.050
That's easy.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.240
Leave him to me.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.670
No need to trouble you, ma'am.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.800
I'll tell the truth.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.000
I'll tell the truth.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:42.830
[With Mind and Heart Fully Devoted]

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:43.480
Yes.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.240
I do know Hongyao,

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.120
but I didn't kill that woman.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.840
Although I hired someone

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.910
to investigate her new lover,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.530
I had no ill intentions.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.360
Besides,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.250
how could I bear to have her killed?

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.040
Who did you hire to investigate Hongyao?

00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.620
Cat.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.150
An expert in spying on

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.270
and tracking the secrets
of wealthy households.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.080
Cat?

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.910
Do you know his real name?

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.590
Of course not.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.320
When hiring people like him,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.510
I understand the rules.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.390
You can't ask for their real names.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.150
Rules?

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.950
Who made all these rules?

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.440
Some rules can get people killed.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.240
All right.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.790
While Xijun is here,

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.720
have her sketch both Cat

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.440
and

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.390
the one who hired Hu Shentong.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.080
You are the Chief of Secret Agents.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.910
How do you think

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.170
we should investigate these two people?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.550
These two people...

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.830
Wait a moment.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.860
Wuming, Lu Lingfeng,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.270
what Qian Zheng and Hu Shentong described

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.800
may seem vastly different,

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.050
but it's actually quite similar.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.520
That can't be right.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:11.670
These two people look

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.440
completely different,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.960
with different bearings too.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.080
And I think they're

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.750
more than 10 years apart in age.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.300
Under different states of mind,

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.030
the same person

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.550
can present themselves differently.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.790
But the most essential part of a portrait

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.320
is to capture the structure
around the eyes and brows.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.120
Although I can't be completely certain,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.910
I have a hunch

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.240
that Qian Zheng and Hu Shentong

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.790
saw the same person.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.150
I suspect

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.230
the full beard is a disguise.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.240
Xijun,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.150
can you remove the disguise?

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.030
That's exactly what I was thinking.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.120
I'll try to draw another one.

[Impartial] [Remonstrance]

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.260
Excellent.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.600
Then, we'll trouble you, Xijun.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.860
How long will you need?

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.300
Half an hour will do.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.650
But I need to be

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.100
alone to draw quietly.

Wuming, Lu Lingfeng.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.340
Xijun,

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.040
you've met Secretary Meng?

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.000
A secretary?

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.120
Which secretary are you talking about?

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.640
The Sushan Shop is doing very well now.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.540
Xijun has been extremely busy,

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.240
so of course, she hasn't met Meng Buyi.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.240
Meng Buyi?

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.680
That's quite an interesting name.

Official Lu, Mr. Su, Miss Xijun.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.500
I'm useless.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.890
I lost Meng Buyi

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.890
in the Ghost Market.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.880

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.000
It's very accurate.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.390
Why don't we use this portrait

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.320
to apprehend him?

and secretly arrest Meng Buyi.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.750
Meng Buyi,

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.390
you haven't come to my herb garden
for tea in a long time.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.590
What's kept you away?

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.650
Zhang San, the man who sold lamb soup,

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.110
was found dead in my house.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.460
Do you think...

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.460
he had some connection

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.790
with Hongyao?

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.440
Well... Hongyao wouldn't be

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.370
having an affair with Zhang San...

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.120
He... He was just a scoundrel.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.390
If Hongyao were looking for a lover,

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.720
shouldn't she at least be more selective?

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.060
It's not right for you
to suspect Hongyao like this.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.640
You're right.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.950
I shouldn't have said that
in front of you.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.960
After all, you two were once

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.510
a perfect match,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.000
destined for each other.

Listen to how jealous you sound.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.960
Back then, why didn't you...

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.360
You...

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.750
Why what?

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.240
When you received your appointment
back then,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.370
you left overnight.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.200
Why didn't you take Hongyao with you?

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:02.550
I...

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:06.920
was young back then,

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.150
worried that being distracted by romance

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.750
would affect my official career.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.210
Now I do have some regrets.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.960
She must have been

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.040
very heartbroken back then.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.220
You regret it?

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.320
No wonder after you took office
in the capital,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.150
Hongyao seemed like

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.390
a completely different person.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.320
You two didn't

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.440
get back together behind my back, right?

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.040
Meng Buyi.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.530
I don't think you came here for tea.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.390
You suspect me, so you came here

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.590
to try to trick me into talking,
didn't you?

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.550
Not really.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.980
It's just that Hongyao
suddenly disappeared.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.280
I just wanted to know

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.000
if you're hiding her somewhere.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.790
How could I possibly hide

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.920
another man's wife?

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.990
Besides, you and I are classmates.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.840
What kind of person

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.640
do you take me, Yan Junxian, for?

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.120
Alright, alright.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.080
It's good that you're not.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.540
It's good that you're not.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.600
It's my fault.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.750
You're not just at fault—

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.080
you're sick in the head!

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:58.960
Yes, yes.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.610
I'm sick.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.480
I...

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.440
I just have trouble sleeping.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.720
After taking your herbs,

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.780
I feel much better.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.750
Meng Buyi, oh, Meng Buyi.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.390
No wonder Hongyao felt aggrieved

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.850
about having to marry you.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.410
What... What did she say?

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.120
She blames you for deceiving her.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.970
Your position as a secretary

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.550
isn't a real official post at all.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.210
Why didn't you explain this clearly
to Hongyao?

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.840
Then how did she find out?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.550
Secrets can't stay hidden forever.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.630
You're just stubborn.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.550
After passing the imperial examination

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.630
and waiting for the Ministry
of Personnel's selection test,

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.840
who doesn't give gifts
to the chief examiner?

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.240
You just had to act morally superior.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.720
As a result, the chief examiner said

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.840
that your "speech" component
in the four evaluation criteria

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.030
didn't meet the requirements
for clear articulation,

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.360
so they gave you
a mere secretary position.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:41.960
Yes.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.970
But there's still a chance.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.240
After His Majesty ascended the throne,

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.520
he reorganized the Ministry of Personnel.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.850
You're being too naive.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.720
Your options now are either

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.780
to attach yourself

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.390
to a high-ranking official—

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.030
ideally directly to the Princess,

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.290
who can recommend you—

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:58.870
or

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.030
to take the corresponding examination.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.720
But this time,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.870
you must give gifts to the chief examiner

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.070
to be promoted to an official position.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:06.850
Otherwise,

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.600
you can remain a lowly clerk forever,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.550
and never expect Hongyao

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:10.410
to respect you.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.320
Hongyao really isn't here with you?

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.440
She's not!

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.950
Keep running!

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.980
W-Why should I run?

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.080
In the Ghost Market,

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.970
didn't you run pretty fast?

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.630
That's because they were trying
to kill me.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.910
But after I saved you,

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.460
you ran even faster.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.720
You're not a criminal.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.550
Y-You're from
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.150
Seize him.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.060
Why are you treating me like this?

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.250
Official Lu.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.440
Meng Buyi is here.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.600
He's the one who hired me!

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.580
Well, well!

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.200
Tell me,

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.430
why did you hire this

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.200
whatever-his-name-is

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.260
to assassinate me?

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.090
Because I want you dead!

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.920
You seduced my wife, Hongyao.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.510
-Shouldn't I kill you?
-Wait, wait!

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.030
How did you know

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:41.230
about me and Hongyao?

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:41.920
Qian Zheng,

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.440
didn't you hire a household spy

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.880
to investigate Hongyao?

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:47.750
Yeah.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.790
Someone called Cat, right?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.510
Yeah.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.400
Take a closer look

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.970
at his face.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.670
Step back!

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.240
Come here!

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.600
You are Cat?

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.440
It's me.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.790
Do you have proof?

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.640
Tell me,

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.110
w-w-where...

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.590
does she live?

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:20.770
It was you!

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.790
You disguised yourself

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.070
as that household spy!

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:24.960
What rotten luck for me—

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.270
I actually hired you to...
to snoop on Hongyao!

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.790
Now you know you're unlucky?

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.710
What about when you seduced my wife,

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:30.570
Hongyao?

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.480
You deserve your misfortune!
You deserve to die!

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.550
What about your wife?

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.640
Now I'm also a victim of Hongyao's...

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.550
Hongyao's infidelity.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.070
I'm a victim too.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.270
Shut your mouth!

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.310
You slap me!

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.790
You don't reflect on yourself,

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:46.790
yet you slap me?

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.940
You married Hongyao,

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.350
but have you ever cared about her?

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.160
You've never even taken her

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.560
around Chang'an.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.180
Meng Buyi, that man,

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.510
doesn't even give Hongyao money to spend!

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.420
She is so beautiful.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.110
Shouldn't she have

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.790
the finest jewelry and clothes

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.380
to match her beauty?

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.030
Yet you slap me!

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.040
Hu Shentong,

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.440
don't you claim to be

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.920
the top assassin of the Ghost Market?

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.000
You took my deposit.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.200
Why is he still alive?

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.170
Let me be more specific.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.640
I, Hu Shentong,

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.490
am Chang'an Ghost Market's

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.770
top assassin at bargain prices!

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.990
Nothing good comes cheap!

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.070
You hired me,

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.200
and that's just your bad luck!

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.160
Bad luck indeed!

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.640
Enough. Take them both away.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:28.880
Wait!

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.440
-He just slapped me, and that's it?
-Move!

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:30.830
Move!

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.720
Why am I so unlucky?

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.550
Meng Buyi, oh, Meng Buyi.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.480
You're a secretary
in the Ministry of Revenue,

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.310
responsible for handling
household registrations, land allocation,

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.880
and taxation matters.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.790
You also need to assist
your senior officials

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.950
in making relevant decisions.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.060
Though not a formal official,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.750
you must be quite busy.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.310
I admire that you can still find time

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.640
to write strange tales.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.960
And you even work as a household spy.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.920
Can you manage all that?

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.270
Busy indeed,

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.640
but I manage.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.750
Just need to sleep less.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:15.820
Meng Buyi.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.720
You, as a clerk of
the Ministry of Revenue,

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.000
hired an assassin to kill someone—

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.330
do you admit your guilt?

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:23.240
Official Lu,

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.320
though I hired an assassin,

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.920
the murder was unsuccessful.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.590
Surely, I deserve a lighter sentence.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.990
Besides, my wife is still

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.650
nowhere to be found, dead or alive.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:32.980
And you brought me here.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.270
Why... Why are you interrogating me?

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:36.680
Secretary Meng,

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.250
just now in court,

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.790
you brawled with a witness.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.650
I could have you beaten with rods
right now for that.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.870
Meng Buyi,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.070
since you might

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.830
hire an assassin to kill Qian Zheng,

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.550
you could also have hired other assassins

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.480
to kill Hongyao.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:50.590
You might have

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.000
even killed

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.730
your own wife

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.270
and hidden her body,

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.800
claiming she disappeared!

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.030
Is that true or not?

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.230
Confess truthfully!

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.540
Lu Lingfeng, Su Wuming,

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.160
you two once

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.400
solved the mysterious Cantian Tower case,

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.510
which was a remarkable achievement,

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.160
and captured the Demon Lord
at Chengfo Temple,

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.960
making you renowned throughout Chang'an.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.470
Is this... all you can do?

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.350
Letting a mere boy

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.350
ramble on without evidence

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.480
in this court?

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.100
This is ridiculous.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.120
You...

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.080
Captain Xue,

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.150
you're speaking out of turn.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.670
Secretary Meng, may I ask

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.450
what you were doing last night?

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.690
On night duty at the ministry office.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:37.790
But a house-squatter

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.830
saw you return home,

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.440
climbing over the wall.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.840
I did no such thing.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:47.240
Shall we summon the witness
to confront you here and now?

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.770
Bring them in.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.360
Is your witness

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.480
this white-haired

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.870
little thief?

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.730
Was the hair on my bed

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:03.820
also his?

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.400
And what's this "house-squatter" nonsense?

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.720
I think he's just a thief!

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.380
You actually believe a thief?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.970
I'm not a thief.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.240
I really saw you jump over the wall.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.500
I was that close to you.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.340
You left through the door.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.550
You were carrying a stack of papers.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.160
Shut up!

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.200
I was on night duty
at the Ministry of Revenue yesterday.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.060
I never left the ministry office.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.500
The senior clerk can testify for me.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:28.390
I, Meng Buyi,

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.070
may be just a minor clerk at the ministry,

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.110
but at least I'm
an upright gentleman, right?

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.310
You don't believe me,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.680
but you believe

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.270
this white-haired little thief?

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.590
He's completely slandering me!

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.990
You...

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.730
Official Lu,

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:39.510
can your Yongzhou Prefecture Office

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.110
do anything useful for once?

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.590
My wife has been

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.200
missing for quite some time now.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.720
If you're not going to look for her,

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.160
fine—

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.840
I'll go find her myself!

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:50.960
Stop right there!

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.690
Captain Xue!

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.420
I'm telling the truth.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.120
I really saw him last night.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:05.360
Xue Huan.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.380
Keep following him.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.340
Don't lose him.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.310
Yes.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.480
Jiang,

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.110
in your previous testimony,

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.550
you said that after Secretary Meng left,

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.720
Hongyao came out

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.400
with another person, right?

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:18.790
Yes.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.890
Do you remember
what that person looked like?

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:22.830
I do.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.030

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.130
I even saw Mr. Yan

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.680
washing mint leaves for Ming Shi himself.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.740
If I had his master,

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.510
I'd be happy to be a servant too.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.440
Who wouldn't?

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:26.740
Hongyao?

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.680
Hongyao!

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:32.770
Hongyao!

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:50.920
Master,

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.540
did you

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:53.810
take Hongyao away?

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.680
You really can't let go of that woman.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.480
Have you forgotten—seven years ago,

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.720
it was I who stopped you from
being with her

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.330
all the time

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.240
and forced you to study hard,

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.830
and that's how you passed
the imperial examination?

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:07.870
Otherwise,

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.400
you'd still be in the mountains
of Lingnan,

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.070
worth nothing.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.820
Even if I had married Hongyao,

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.630
it wouldn't have affected my...

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.820
your political career.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.590
Shut up.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.990
Forget about that woman.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.210
Now you need to

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:29.090
focus on growing gastrodia for me.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.350
It's the Emperor's

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.240
favorite tonic these days.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.000
And you...

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.470
you're already lucky enough.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.480
As an eighth-rank official,

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.110
you're allowed to wear the crimson robe

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.350
and are treated as a fifth-rank official,

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:40.640
even above your superior,
the Chief Imperial Physician

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.070
of the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.920
All of this is

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.070
the result of my careful planning.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.190
Instead of being grateful...

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.070
you come to question me?

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.480
Master,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:55.930
I'm begging you.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.750
Hongyao won't hinder my career.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.280
I will do my utmost to become

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.070
the Chief Minister
of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.200
That won't suffice.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.270
I want you to climb

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.550
step by step—

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.270
until you reach the Chancellor position
for me.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.480
By then,

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.070
I—

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.270
a mere herbal merchant with no right

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.800
to take the imperial exams—

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.070
will become

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:22.000
the shadow ruler of Chang'an.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.100
Okay, okay.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.040
You can be the shadow ruler,

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.860
but tell me where Hongyao is.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.480
It must be that Meng Buyi came,

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.640
and you feared being exposed,

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.030
so you made her
move elsewhere, didn't you?

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:39.690
This is none of your business.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:41.270
Forget about Hongyao

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.410
and focus on your official duties.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.010
Don't let my painstaking efforts
go to waste.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.660
Ming Shi, you've gone too far!

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.790
I, Yan Junxian, have my limits too!

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.510
[Ming Shi, House Servant]

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.780
[Ming Shi, Herbal Merchant]

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.830
You dare to lose your temper with me?

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.810
And you call yourself "Yan Junxian"?

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.880
Have you forgotten

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.070
your real name?

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.030
Moorhen!

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:11.890
What are you doing?

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:14.590
Mr. Yan,

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.830
this man dared to disrespect you.

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:16.880
We'll teach him a lesson for you.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.210
Beat him! Beat him hard!

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:27.050
Enough. Stop beating him.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:29.680
Don't think that being a house servant

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.830
gives you the right to disrespect Mr. Yan.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.720
As a servant, if you forget
your place again,

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.580
we'll teach you a lesson anytime!

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.680
You may go now.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.580
Go back to work.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:38.830
Mr. Yan.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:40.890
-Go!
-Let's go.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:48.070
Master.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.640
I couldn't stop them just now.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.900
-Otherwise, they would've...
-Shut up.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.000
Please calm down, Master.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:55.680
Lately,

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.590
I keep thinking about our days in Lingnan.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:58.920
Before you told me to study

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.160
[Yan Junxian, Deputy Chief
Imperial Physician]

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.300
and prepare for the imperial examinations,

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.200
[And Herb Garden Supervisor]

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:01.710
although I was just your servant,

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:02.880
[Original Name: Moorhen;
Ming Shi's House Servant]

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.750
back then,

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:05.840
life was truly carefree...

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.030
You think I enjoy dealing with

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.690
those arrogant northerners?

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:12.070
I can't even get fresh lychees here.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.370
Why don't we go back?

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.969
Like Zhang Han of the Western Jin,

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.710
who longed for home delicacies

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.239
when the autumn winds rose.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.880
Well, look at you,

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.550
even knowing a literary reference.

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:26.110
Next, you'll say

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.480
you want me to let you marry Hongyao,

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.360
then have children

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.090
and enjoy family bliss, right?

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:32.070
Dream on!

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.760
Mr. Yan!

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.710
Officials from
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office have come.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.570
The Yongzhou Prefecture Office?

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.600
Why did they come to my herb garden?

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.710
Secretary Meng, aren't you supposed to be
on night duty?

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.550
It's still so early.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.880
Why are you here already?

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.080
I had nowhere else to go, so I came early.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.219
Where's the senior clerk?

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.000
In the afternoon,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.070
officials from
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office came.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:57.550
Officials from
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office came?

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:58.320
For what?

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.590
They invited the senior clerk for drinks.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:01.960
They were actually quite polite.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.670
I even overheard them

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.960
saying something like,

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.620
"Sushan goes well with wine."

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.830
The one above.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.940
Finally, we bought it.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.860
I'll try it when I get back.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.530
Okay, okay.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.280
Have some tea.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.310
No need for tea.

I'm here

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.650
to show you a painting.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.140
A painting?

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.480
Who painted this portrait of me?

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.320
I did.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.010
But miss, we've never met before.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.670
I haven't seen you in person,

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:54.870
but someone else has.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.500
I painted this based on

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.920
that person's description.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.320
Who?

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.220
As for that person's name,

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.170
I'm not at liberty to reveal it.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.390
However, Official Lu certainly knows.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.760
This matter involves a murder case.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.960
I must ask you to cooperate

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.360
and answer my questions truthfully,

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.820

or have any concerns,

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:21.800
you can come with me to
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.000
But before that,

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.070
I'll need your men to cooperate with mine

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.000
to thoroughly search the herb garden

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.230

What's your suggestion?

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.360
You're asking me?

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.760
You're a skilled artist,

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.510
and you've been observing

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.070
both Yan Junxian and Meng Buyi.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:27.710
You must have noticed quite a bit

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:28.920
from their expressions.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:29.230
So,

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.960
I'm asking for your advice.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.360
It's just my intuition.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.320
I think they both seem guilty
of something.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.760
Since they're old acquaintances

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.230
and involved with the same woman...

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.430
why not try questioning them together?

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.590
We're thinking alike.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.690
You don't really need my advice.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.630
You saw I was exhausted at the shop

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:51.550
and found an excuse

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.010
to give me a day off, right?

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.370
That's not true.

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:56.710
Without your artistic skills,

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:57.510
how could I have tracked down

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:58.440

crucial to me—

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.160
not just in assisting me
with solving mysterious cases.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:14.560
I admit it.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:15.800
Last night...

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.340
I went home.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.480
But we have

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.230
already sent people
to the Ministry of Revenue.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:24.830
The senior clerk can testify

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.710
that you were on night duty all night

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:27.800
and never left.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.800
He kept pestering me last night,

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.150
telling me some story about snake spirits.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:32.470
It was complete nonsense

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:33.400
and extremely boring.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.030
I didn't want to listen,

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.710
so I opened a jar of wine for him.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:37.150
That senior clerk couldn't
hold his liquor.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.030
He passed out after just two bowls

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.090
and slept for most of the night.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.630
I took that opportunity

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:43.360
to go home.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.280
Because I needed a lot of paper

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.280
to continue writing the strange tales,

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.590
and using the ministry's paper

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:50.050
wouldn't be appropriate.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.610
Ever since Yan Junxian

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.920
returned to the capital for his post,

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.760
Hongyao and I haven't been getting along.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.360
So,

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.040
I've always suspected him.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.400
After I entered the courtyard,

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.710
I saw candles lit in the room.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.820
So I went up and pounded hard on the door.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.680
I just wanted to give them a scare.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.320
Hongyao,

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:33.430
open the door!

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.400
Who is it?

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.280
Me!

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:36.600
Open up quickly!

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:38.160
Coming, coming!

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:41.880
Weren't you supposed to be
on night duty tonight?

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.250
Why are you back so soon?

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:48.760
Why are you looking around?

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.890
Did you come back to catch me cheating?

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.590
Let...

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.280
Let me ask you!

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.250
I should be the one asking you!

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.590
You told me you held a position
at the Ministry of Revenue,

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:00.630
but a secretary is just

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.840
a minor clerk.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.960
There are 50 or 60 of you
in the ministry alone!

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.880
Not only is the position lowly,

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.320
it doesn't even qualify
as a proper official rank!

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.070
How much longer do you plan to
keep lying to me?

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.130
Who's lying to you?

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.510
Though the secretary position is minor...

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:15.230
it carries significant responsibilities!

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:16.510
It's still a ninth-rank position!

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.280
Come on,

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:18.280
how can an unranked position

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.210
compare to a proper official rank?

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:20.670
I...

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.880
You've been in the secretary position
for seven years.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.000
If you ever thought of me,

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.710
you wouldn't spend every day

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.590
writing those strange tales

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.920
instead of trying to advance yourself!

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.630
Divorce me!

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.410
What did you say?

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.440
Divorce me!

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.760
Divorce you

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.660
just so you can get back with Yan Junxian?

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.610
Not a chance!

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.450
Though I didn't confront them directly,

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:52.760
you, Yan Junxian,

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.480
were hiding in my house at that time.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.750
Tell me, where exactly were you hiding?

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:58.280
I...

00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.260
Well...

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.620
Meng Buyi,

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.070
you claim your wife has been unfaithful.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.270
Do you have evidence?

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.640
Yes, I do.

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.400
When I entered the room,

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:08.440
I saw a pair of

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.370
brown boots

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:10.590
hidden under the bed!

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:12.030
I saw them as clear as day!

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:13.630
These very boots!

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.320
Official Lu, I...

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.800
Meng Buyi,

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:19.910
do you have anything else to say?

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.320
I... I...

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.030
Nothing for now.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.860
Deputy Chief Physician Yan,
it's your turn.

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:32.470
Since someone drew my portrait...

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:33.070
Hold on!

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.920
Official Lu,

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:37.880
what do you mean by this?

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.360
You address him respectfully as
"Deputy Chief Physician Yan,"

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.960
but call me directly by name?

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.480
What are you two playing at?

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.480
Officials covering for each other?

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:49.480
I am

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:51.960
the current Yongzhou Judicial Official.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:54.630
Although I can't wear
the light crimson official robes,

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:56.590
I have no need to curry favor with him.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.190
After all,

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:58.960
I was

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.760
the former General
of the Right Imperial Guards

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.440
and former Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review Court...

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:02.840
But...

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.480
But you make a valid point.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.230
I spoke inappropriately earlier.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.440
From now on,

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.130
I shall address both of you directly
by name.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:12.440
Yan Junxian,

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.360
Meng Buyi suspects

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.560
you were in his home last night.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.420
What do you say?

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.180
Think carefully before you speak,

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.710
because everything you say

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.020
will be recorded in the court ledger.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.510
Since someone drew my portrait,

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:28.800
someone must have seen me

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.110
entering and leaving the Meng Residence.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:30.670
Besides,

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.760
I didn't do anything

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.700
shameful.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.150
Why shouldn't I admit it?

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:36.720
Curse you, Yan Junxian.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.150
You met my wife secretly

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.590
while I was on night duty!

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.280
So what if I went to your house?

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.450
So what if I met with Hongyao?

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:43.910
She was mine to begin with!

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:45.190
How dare you act so disrespectfully

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.920
in court!
