LOVE & CROWN

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:31.025
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:33.785
EPISODE 1

00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:36.025
Grand Tutor Ling,

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:38.785
when will you let me rule in my own right?

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.105
The day Cangcang weds you

00:01:41.185 --> 00:01:43.945
will be the day you take real power.

00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:00.345
You asked me here

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:02.305
because of your master?

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:04.065
You knew, yet you still dared to come?

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:07.105
I killed him

00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:08.345
for a reason.

00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:09.584
A reason?

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:14.585
Yes.

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:17.305
One I cannot tell you.

00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:19.665
Then I won't ask.

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:22.425
I only want the outcome.

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:39.385
XIAO HUAN, EMPEROR OF GREAT QI

00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:42.225
LING CANGCANG, GRAND TUTOR'S DAUGHTER

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:47.905
What are you waiting for?

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:51.505
Didn't you say you wanted to kill me?

00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:53.705
I will give you the chance.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:57.465
Do it.

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:32.945
Ling Cangcang,

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:35.985
you're too soft after all.

00:04:00.705 --> 00:04:02.945
Better prepare for our wedding.

00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:07.505
You killed my master.

00:04:08.545 --> 00:04:09.745
How could I ever marry you?

00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:35.105
You will,

00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:37.905
because you have no choice.

00:04:39.185 --> 00:04:40.265
In two months,

00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:45.465
I will make you my empress.

00:04:58.225 --> 00:04:59.185
Hongqing,

00:05:00.545 --> 00:05:02.305
escort the future
empress back to the Ling Manor.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:03.265
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:05:20.785 --> 00:05:23.265
LING MANOR

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:35.305
LING XUEFENG, GRAND TUTOR OF GREAT QI

00:05:36.665 --> 00:05:37.825
Father.

00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:46.665
I will never marry him.

00:05:48.345 --> 00:05:49.225
My Lady,

00:05:49.305 --> 00:05:51.145
whatever you decide,
you should talk it out with Father.

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:57.305
Cangcang,

00:06:01.225 --> 00:06:02.705
it is

00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:06.145
an imperial decree.

00:06:07.265 --> 00:06:08.385
To defy it is a crime

00:06:08.465 --> 00:06:10.265
punishable by
the extermination of the whole clan.

00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:12.465
Father,

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.625
you helped him to the throne,

00:06:15.705 --> 00:06:17.505
and this is how he repays you?

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:18.785
Mind your tongue.

00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:23.225
Father.

00:06:26.145 --> 00:06:29.385
He is now the Emperor.

00:06:31.145 --> 00:06:32.625
"When a ruler commands death,

00:06:34.425 --> 00:06:36.105
a subject must obey."

00:06:36.185 --> 00:06:37.265
So an emperor

00:06:38.025 --> 00:06:40.625
may kill at will and trample human life?

00:06:41.225 --> 00:06:43.385
His Majesty is the ruler of Great Qi.

00:06:44.545 --> 00:06:47.105
What he does and whom he kills

00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:48.545
is not for others to judge.

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:50.745
But he killed my master!

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:07.105
Father, I'd rather die than marry him!

00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:22.065
There were reasons

00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:24.825
your Master Li Lu had to die.

00:07:32.905 --> 00:07:33.945
Luo.

00:07:34.025 --> 00:07:36.145
LUO XIANXUE, GRAND TUTOR'S ADOPTED SON

00:07:39.065 --> 00:07:39.905
Here.

00:07:40.505 --> 00:07:41.505
It's snowing hard.

00:07:41.585 --> 00:07:42.585
Don't catch cold.

00:07:46.905 --> 00:07:47.745
Let's go.

00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:10.665
Cangcang!

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:12.505
Come on.

00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:41.505
If you wish to die,

00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:44.105
I can oblige.

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:52.985
Mind your manners!

00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:56.585
Stand down!

00:08:58.825 --> 00:09:00.425
Your Majesty, I am guilty.

00:09:01.225 --> 00:09:02.065
What guilt?

00:09:03.465 --> 00:09:04.545
You are my teacher.

00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.105
You once fought alongside my father.

00:09:06.185 --> 00:09:08.065
As I said before, outside the court,

00:09:08.745 --> 00:09:10.865
you need not kneel to me.

00:09:11.745 --> 00:09:13.865
I failed to discipline my child.

00:09:13.945 --> 00:09:16.105
Please forgive me!

00:09:17.065 --> 00:09:19.705
Traitors courting death

00:09:20.785 --> 00:09:22.505
have nothing to do with you.

00:09:22.585 --> 00:09:23.705
Xiao Huan!

00:09:26.385 --> 00:09:27.945
There's no love between us.

00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:29.185
Why can't you let me go?

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.345
We are bound by fate.

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:35.265
I will never let you go.

00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:39.465
Let's go.

00:09:50.545 --> 00:09:52.705
What an intrepid warrior,
repaying kindness with betrayal.

00:09:53.305 --> 00:09:54.865
I forced him to take me.

00:09:54.945 --> 00:09:55.825
Come at me.

00:09:56.425 --> 00:09:57.465
Luo Xianxue,

00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:00.345
I warned you back in Southern Chu.

00:10:01.425 --> 00:10:02.985
Did you really think you could escape?

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:05.905
Father, forgive me.

00:10:16.025 --> 00:10:17.225
Dying by my sword

00:10:18.065 --> 00:10:19.905
-is no injustice to you.
-Xiao Huan!

00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:21.665
Let him go,

00:10:22.985 --> 00:10:23.825
or I'll take my life right here.

00:10:33.945 --> 00:10:34.985
If you dare take your own life,

00:10:35.985 --> 00:10:38.345
the entire Ling clan
will follow you to the grave.

00:10:46.265 --> 00:10:47.465
Your Majesty…

00:11:08.385 --> 00:11:09.225
Father…

00:11:09.825 --> 00:11:10.745
Your Majesty, I am guilty.

00:11:11.945 --> 00:11:12.825
I beg

00:11:13.665 --> 00:11:15.265
to resign my post.

00:11:15.825 --> 00:11:17.825
Please, Your Majesty,

00:11:17.905 --> 00:11:20.705
show mercy and spare

00:11:23.025 --> 00:11:24.825
my only daughter.

00:11:36.505 --> 00:11:37.425
Father…

00:11:48.745 --> 00:11:49.705
Xiao Huan,

00:11:50.945 --> 00:11:52.025
what do you want from me?

00:11:53.705 --> 00:11:54.705
I want you

00:11:56.225 --> 00:11:57.505
to marry me of your own free will.

00:12:00.385 --> 00:12:01.865
Then spare the Ling clan

00:12:02.625 --> 00:12:03.665
and spare Luo Xianxue!

00:12:05.665 --> 00:12:07.305
Is this how you beg?

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:23.705
I, Ling Cangcang,

00:12:24.985 --> 00:12:25.825
humbly beg Your Majesty

00:12:26.505 --> 00:12:27.785
to spare the Ling clan

00:12:29.065 --> 00:12:30.105
and spare Luo Xianxue.

00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:33.025
I will return home with my father

00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:36.905
and marry you

00:12:38.105 --> 00:12:39.345
in two months.

00:12:40.785 --> 00:12:41.665
Oh?

00:12:43.025 --> 00:12:45.265
You make it sound as if I forced you.

00:12:54.345 --> 00:12:55.465
I, Ling Cangcang,

00:12:59.305 --> 00:13:00.305
wish

00:13:01.225 --> 00:13:02.465
to marry Your Majesty.

00:13:05.265 --> 00:13:06.185
Please

00:13:07.545 --> 00:13:09.145
grant your consent.

00:13:31.105 --> 00:13:33.185
-Hongqing.
-Yes.

00:13:33.265 --> 00:13:34.905
Take Luo Xianxue back to the palace.

00:13:35.505 --> 00:13:37.145
He'll bear witness to
the future empress's vow.

00:13:37.225 --> 00:13:38.225
Understood.

00:13:48.105 --> 00:13:49.025
Grand Tutor Ling,

00:13:50.105 --> 00:13:51.825
you truly played a fine move.

00:13:55.065 --> 00:13:56.225
You let Cangcang go

00:13:57.105 --> 00:13:59.865
and then used the lives
of your clan and Luo Xianxue

00:14:00.705 --> 00:14:03.985
to make her agree to marry me.

00:14:05.225 --> 00:14:06.865
You remain the kind father in her heart,

00:14:07.465 --> 00:14:11.345
while I have become the ruthless villain.

00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:14.425
Your skill truly surpasses mine.

00:14:17.825 --> 00:14:18.905
Your Majesty,

00:14:19.905 --> 00:14:21.585
you've gotten what you wished for.

00:14:24.945 --> 00:14:26.265
Are you not satisfied?

00:14:40.345 --> 00:14:43.265
TWO MONTHS LATER

00:14:44.465 --> 00:14:46.145
CHANGHE GATE

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:52.265
By imperial decree,

00:14:52.345 --> 00:14:56.705
the daughter of Grand Tutor Ling,
Ling Cangcang, is hereby named Empress.

00:14:57.905 --> 00:15:01.185
The officials shall attend
the ceremony bearing their insignias.

00:15:06.585 --> 00:15:09.305
DU TINGXIN,
IMPERIAL PRECEPTOR OF GREAT QI

00:15:09.385 --> 00:15:11.545
Madam,
His Majesty's wedding is about to begin.

00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:12.465
Please come down and change.

00:15:16.345 --> 00:15:18.225
The refinement of
the pill is at a critical stage.

00:15:19.545 --> 00:15:20.945
I cannot afford distraction.

00:15:27.985 --> 00:15:29.465
Such worldly affairs

00:15:31.585 --> 00:15:32.705
need not concern me.

00:15:34.185 --> 00:15:35.105
Understood.

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:41.305
THE CAPITAL

00:15:43.545 --> 00:15:44.985
By decree,

00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:48.105
I come at this auspicious
hour to escort Her Majesty.

00:15:49.385 --> 00:15:51.505
I follow the rites as commanded.

00:15:57.625 --> 00:15:58.785
The auspicious hour is upon us.

00:15:58.865 --> 00:16:00.585
Please don your coronet and bridal robes.

00:17:10.224 --> 00:17:11.424
That snowy night,

00:17:12.025 --> 00:17:13.985
who was it that said
she would willingly marry me?

00:17:15.105 --> 00:17:16.265
What is it?

00:17:16.345 --> 00:17:18.184
Have you changed your mind?

00:17:19.704 --> 00:17:21.184
How could I

00:17:23.065 --> 00:17:24.944
willingly marry a murderer?

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:30.985
Don't you want

00:17:31.065 --> 00:17:32.665
to enter the palace and
see your adoptive brother?

00:17:33.745 --> 00:17:35.385
I've had Li Hongqing look after him.

00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:36.505
I wonder

00:17:37.105 --> 00:17:38.745
if he's grown used to life in the palace.

00:17:54.305 --> 00:17:56.425
Heed His Majesty!

00:17:56.505 --> 00:17:57.385
I believe

00:17:57.465 --> 00:17:59.465
the way of governance should
follow the order of Heaven and Earth,

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:02.145
and harmony within
the household is the root of all virtue.

00:18:02.225 --> 00:18:03.905
To teach and to
guide both family and state,

00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:06.545
a woman's virtue is
the foundation of royal morality.

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:09.105
Through such virtue,
the world may share one code of ethics,

00:18:09.185 --> 00:18:11.105
and all hearts may
turn toward righteousness.

00:18:11.185 --> 00:18:13.625
Thus, together we may honor our ancestors

00:18:13.705 --> 00:18:15.185
and uphold filial
piety throughout the realm.

00:18:15.265 --> 00:18:16.905
Ling,

00:18:16.985 --> 00:18:19.825
the daughter of Grand Tutor Ling Xuefeng,

00:18:19.905 --> 00:18:21.265
was born into a noble house

00:18:21.345 --> 00:18:22.985
of enduring virtue and good fortune.

00:18:23.065 --> 00:18:25.065
May the Empress and I

00:18:25.145 --> 00:18:26.625
strive in diligence and respect,

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:28.305
cultivate virtue,

00:18:28.385 --> 00:18:30.865
and carry forward
the grace of our forebears.

00:18:30.945 --> 00:18:32.225
May enlightenment and harmony spread,

00:18:32.305 --> 00:18:34.425
bringing everlasting blessings

00:18:34.505 --> 00:18:37.265
to our descendants and our people.

00:18:37.345 --> 00:18:39.025
Let this be proclaimed

00:18:39.105 --> 00:18:41.425
to all under Heaven.

00:18:44.545 --> 00:18:45.465
The ceremony is complete.

00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:47.265
Please, Your Majesty, keep your word

00:18:48.385 --> 00:18:49.705
and release Luo Xianxue.

00:18:49.785 --> 00:18:51.505
We haven't drunk the nuptial wine yet.

00:18:52.625 --> 00:18:53.585
Once we do,

00:18:55.025 --> 00:18:55.985
you'll let him go.

00:19:24.385 --> 00:19:25.265
The wine is finished.

00:19:26.065 --> 00:19:26.985
Please honor your promise, Your Majesty.

00:19:27.745 --> 00:19:28.665
From this day on,

00:19:29.185 --> 00:19:30.665
you are my empress.

00:19:34.385 --> 00:19:35.465
Go and change.

00:19:51.905 --> 00:19:52.745
Get out.

00:19:57.305 --> 00:19:58.905
You are my empress.

00:19:58.985 --> 00:19:59.945
Why should I leave?

00:20:00.545 --> 00:20:02.305
You promised me you'd set him free.

00:20:04.265 --> 00:20:06.305
-Leave us.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

00:20:10.745 --> 00:20:13.545
On this joyous day,

00:20:14.585 --> 00:20:17.145
is Luo Xianxue all you can think about?

00:20:17.865 --> 00:20:19.985
Between you and me,
is there truly any joy to speak of?

00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:23.225
Do you love him?

00:20:30.705 --> 00:20:31.865
My empress,

00:20:31.945 --> 00:20:34.025
who married me of her own accord,

00:20:34.705 --> 00:20:35.745
did so out of love for Luo Xianxue?

00:20:36.865 --> 00:20:39.585
Is that why you
tried to run away with him?

00:20:56.425 --> 00:20:57.825
Answer me.

00:21:14.705 --> 00:21:17.105
Cangcang, I truly love you.

00:21:17.825 --> 00:21:18.745
Marry me.

00:21:27.985 --> 00:21:28.825
Yes, I love him.

00:21:29.585 --> 00:21:30.785
If I could choose,

00:21:31.465 --> 00:21:33.345
I'd flee this cursed city with him.

00:21:34.505 --> 00:21:35.345
Are you satisfied now?

00:21:36.145 --> 00:21:38.105
Do you know what you just said

00:21:38.185 --> 00:21:39.385
is enough to have him
executed ten thousand times?

00:21:40.025 --> 00:21:41.905
If he dies, I won't live either.

00:21:46.945 --> 00:21:49.145
Threatening me with death?

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:50.825
That only works if I care about you.

00:21:51.745 --> 00:21:54.065
Do you really think I do?

00:22:16.905 --> 00:22:19.705
You are destined
to become Empress someday.

00:22:19.785 --> 00:22:21.905
I don't care for that title.

00:22:22.665 --> 00:22:25.665
I just want to win someone's heart
and roam the world with my sword.

00:22:28.265 --> 00:22:29.545
Find a chance to leave first.

00:22:30.145 --> 00:22:31.665
I will make sure you are unharmed.

00:22:31.745 --> 00:22:33.065
If you dare take your own life,

00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:36.225
the entire Ling clan
will follow you to the grave.

00:22:59.985 --> 00:23:00.985
Who are you?

00:23:04.425 --> 00:23:06.025
Are you Ling Cangcang

00:23:13.385 --> 00:23:15.145
or the Empress of Great Qi?

00:23:17.545 --> 00:23:19.385
Do you love the Emperor?

00:23:31.545 --> 00:23:33.105
Or do you love

00:23:36.385 --> 00:23:37.585
Bai Chifan?

00:23:45.625 --> 00:23:46.705
Bai Chifan…

00:23:52.545 --> 00:23:54.145
Why did you lie to me?

00:23:57.465 --> 00:23:59.185
He does not exist.

00:23:59.905 --> 00:24:00.865
Bai Chifan…

00:24:04.265 --> 00:24:07.705
Bai Chifan never existed.

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:14.585
Bai Chifan…

00:24:47.265 --> 00:24:49.225
You slept well last night, my empress.

00:24:49.305 --> 00:24:50.745
What do you want?

00:24:51.425 --> 00:24:52.825
Why so hostile toward me?

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:57.345
I came first thing this morning
with a gift for you.

00:24:57.985 --> 00:24:58.945
What gift?

00:24:59.025 --> 00:25:01.225
Your adoptive brother, Luo Xianxue,

00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:03.265
was returned
to the Ling Manor this morning.

00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:09.825
Really?

00:25:10.785 --> 00:25:11.625
A ruler does not jest.

00:25:17.985 --> 00:25:19.025
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:25:27.545 --> 00:25:29.745
I kept something of Luo's

00:25:29.825 --> 00:25:30.945
as a present for you.

00:25:57.985 --> 00:26:01.465
Xiaoshan, pick up the gift I brought.

00:26:01.545 --> 00:26:02.705
Keep it safe for the Empress.

00:26:03.745 --> 00:26:04.705
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:26:13.665 --> 00:26:14.825
What are you trying to do?

00:26:20.145 --> 00:26:23.865
My gift is to remind you:

00:26:24.385 --> 00:26:26.225
there are things you must not do

00:26:27.065 --> 00:26:29.705
and rules you must obey.

00:26:30.665 --> 00:26:32.665
Break them, and you will pay the price.

00:26:44.345 --> 00:26:47.345
This pear blossom hairpin
is the one I gave you, isn't it?

00:26:49.225 --> 00:26:50.305
If I recall correctly,

00:26:51.025 --> 00:26:53.305
you wore this very hairpin

00:26:53.385 --> 00:26:54.745
the day you tried to
run off with Luo Xianxue.

00:26:58.745 --> 00:26:59.905
It was picked at random.

00:27:01.665 --> 00:27:03.905
The more casual the choice,
the truer the feeling behind it.

00:27:16.825 --> 00:27:17.825
Remember,

00:27:19.345 --> 00:27:20.865
you are my empress.

00:27:22.185 --> 00:27:24.185
As long as you fulfill
your duties as Empress,

00:27:24.745 --> 00:27:27.585
nothing like today will ever happen again.

00:27:49.025 --> 00:27:49.865
ONE YEAR AGO

00:27:49.945 --> 00:27:50.905
I've heard

00:27:50.985 --> 00:27:53.145
young boys have been
going missing in Southern Chu.

00:27:53.225 --> 00:27:54.705
More than 100 have vanished so far.

00:27:54.785 --> 00:27:56.425
Has anyone reported this?

00:27:58.705 --> 00:28:00.105
Your Majesty,

00:28:00.185 --> 00:28:01.705
Southern Chu has always
been peaceful and prosperous,

00:28:01.785 --> 00:28:02.865
and it is governed by
the Prince of Yuzhang.

00:28:02.945 --> 00:28:05.345
How could that happen?
Perhaps Your Majesty was misinformed.

00:28:05.425 --> 00:28:07.545
Insolence! Though His Majesty
ascended the throne young,

00:28:07.625 --> 00:28:08.545
he is both virtuous and wise.

00:28:08.625 --> 00:28:10.625
How dare you speak so presumptuously?

00:28:10.705 --> 00:28:13.105
The Prince of Yuzhang has
always ruled Southern Chu with diligence.

00:28:13.185 --> 00:28:15.185
We must not
dishearten such a loyal official.

00:28:15.265 --> 00:28:17.105
His Majesty is still young
and hasn't governed personally…

00:28:17.185 --> 00:28:19.065
-Mr. Liu, you are mistaken.
-…It's you schemers…

00:28:19.145 --> 00:28:21.105
-The news has already reached His Majesty.
-…who wish to frame the Prince of Yuzhang…

00:28:21.185 --> 00:28:22.825
-How could it be false?
-…In that case,

00:28:22.905 --> 00:28:24.385
let the Prince of
Yuzhang investigate by himself.

00:28:24.465 --> 00:28:26.745
-Why trouble His Majesty?
-What a ridiculous notion!

00:28:26.825 --> 00:28:27.985
Enough.

00:28:32.225 --> 00:28:34.785
This matter
concerns the peace of an entire region

00:28:35.625 --> 00:28:36.985
and is of great importance.

00:28:37.065 --> 00:28:39.625
To prevent ill-intentioned
men from exploiting it,

00:28:40.305 --> 00:28:41.265
we must

00:28:42.105 --> 00:28:44.145
proceed with utmost caution.

00:28:48.785 --> 00:28:50.385
Those court officials kept chattering,

00:28:50.465 --> 00:28:51.705
saying either that Your Majesty is frail,

00:28:51.785 --> 00:28:52.745
or that you have never ruled in person.

00:28:52.825 --> 00:28:53.465
TRANQUIL CLARITY

00:28:53.545 --> 00:28:54.625
They don't take
Your Majesty seriously at all.

00:28:54.705 --> 00:28:56.225
Grand Tutor Ling promised

00:28:56.305 --> 00:28:58.505
to hand over the reins of power after you
married Miss Ling,

00:28:58.585 --> 00:29:00.825
yet now he keeps delaying,
refusing to yield.

00:29:01.425 --> 00:29:03.745
In court today,
he even defended the Prince of Yuzhang.

00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:05.705
Could he mean to break off the engagement?

00:29:11.985 --> 00:29:14.265
The Grand Tutor holds great power.
He won't give it up easily.

00:29:14.345 --> 00:29:16.745
If I keep backing down,
I'll remain under his control.

00:29:16.825 --> 00:29:18.785
There are spies everywhere in the palace.

00:29:18.865 --> 00:29:21.545
Perhaps it's time to find someone
who can break the stalemate.

00:29:28.385 --> 00:29:30.345
Hongqing, where is Ling Cangcang?

00:29:35.185 --> 00:29:36.225
Southern Chu?

00:29:38.345 --> 00:29:40.145
SOUTHERN CHU

00:29:40.225 --> 00:29:40.865
RECRUITING TALENTS

00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:42.545
-Shall we give it a try?
-Let's go.

00:29:42.625 --> 00:29:43.345
Everyone,

00:29:43.425 --> 00:29:44.025
FENGLAI PAVILION

00:29:44.105 --> 00:29:46.225
Fenglai Pavilion
offers a heavy reward today

00:29:46.305 --> 00:29:47.145
to seek a new hall master.

00:29:47.225 --> 00:29:49.825
Whoever can defeat Hall Master Luo

00:29:49.905 --> 00:29:52.385
will be hired immediately.
The pay is ten liang a month.

00:29:52.465 --> 00:29:54.745
-Ten liang?
-Ten liang for real?

00:29:55.825 --> 00:29:59.225
Why would Grand Tutor Ling
allow his only daughter

00:29:59.305 --> 00:30:00.865
to linger in a place like this?

00:30:01.465 --> 00:30:03.425
Isn't he afraid a stray blade

00:30:04.025 --> 00:30:05.945
-might harm his precious girl?
-You go!

00:30:06.025 --> 00:30:08.865
I heard Ling Cangcang defied her father
and ran away from home.

00:30:08.945 --> 00:30:10.225
According to Shi Yan,

00:30:10.305 --> 00:30:11.945
the man over there, Luo Xianxue,

00:30:12.745 --> 00:30:14.385
is known as Southern Chu's Top Swordsman.

00:30:16.945 --> 00:30:18.345
Yes!

00:30:25.185 --> 00:30:27.745
As for that woman, her name is Zhong Lin.

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:28.825
She's a skilled fighter as well.

00:30:36.145 --> 00:30:37.425
With those two around,

00:30:37.505 --> 00:30:39.665
I doubt Ling Cangcang is in any danger.

00:30:49.185 --> 00:30:52.265
-Wonderful!
-Amazing!

00:30:55.545 --> 00:30:56.985
It seems she and her father

00:30:57.665 --> 00:30:58.985
aren't quite the same.

00:31:02.065 --> 00:31:05.265
An hour has passed.
Does anyone else dare to challenge?

00:31:05.945 --> 00:31:07.545
No one's stepped up for a while.

00:31:07.625 --> 00:31:09.185
What's going on?

00:31:09.265 --> 00:31:10.345
No challengers at all?

00:31:13.305 --> 00:31:14.825
If no one comes forward,

00:31:14.905 --> 00:31:16.065
-then we'll…
-Wait!

00:31:17.105 --> 00:31:18.145
-Go!
-He's going up!

00:31:18.225 --> 00:31:19.585
-Let him on!
-Hurry!

00:31:19.665 --> 00:31:21.105
Over here! Someone's going up!

00:31:21.185 --> 00:31:27.025
-Go!
-Go!

00:31:27.105 --> 00:31:28.305
-Hurry!
-Go!

00:31:28.385 --> 00:31:29.825
-Go!
-Go!

00:31:29.905 --> 00:31:36.785
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:31:54.945 --> 00:31:56.305
Wait!

00:32:02.065 --> 00:32:02.905
EXEMPLARY VIRTUE

00:32:02.985 --> 00:32:04.625
He looked like the Prince of Yuzhang.

00:32:04.705 --> 00:32:06.185
He wouldn't draw
suspicion disguised as the Prince.

00:32:06.705 --> 00:32:08.625
Why not let him compete?

00:32:08.705 --> 00:32:09.985
He didn't come with good intentions.

00:32:10.585 --> 00:32:11.425
We mustn't use him.

00:32:12.065 --> 00:32:13.185
What is this, Miss Ling?

00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:14.785
Are you going back on your word?

00:32:15.465 --> 00:32:16.465
I knew it.

00:32:16.545 --> 00:32:17.905
He was calm and composed,

00:32:17.985 --> 00:32:19.425
certainly no ordinary fighter.

00:32:19.945 --> 00:32:21.465
His stance was steady,

00:32:21.545 --> 00:32:23.145
yet his hands bore no calluses.

00:32:23.225 --> 00:32:24.625
He was clearly trained by a master

00:32:24.705 --> 00:32:25.825
but lacked real combat experience.

00:32:26.785 --> 00:32:28.665
And that upright bearing,

00:32:28.745 --> 00:32:29.705
that air of nobility…

00:32:29.785 --> 00:32:31.905
He must be

00:32:34.025 --> 00:32:36.625
a spy sent by my father.

00:32:38.985 --> 00:32:40.425
Who are you calling a spy?

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:42.465
How did you get in here?

00:32:43.145 --> 00:32:44.905
The match was suddenly canceled.

00:32:45.705 --> 00:32:47.505
Even the guards are
busy explaining things.

00:32:50.145 --> 00:32:52.105
Uninvited guest, what brings you here?

00:32:52.185 --> 00:32:54.585
I sincerely wish to join Fenglai Pavilion.

00:32:58.025 --> 00:32:59.385
There's an expression that suits you well:

00:33:02.225 --> 00:33:03.985
-fine on the outside
-but rotten within.

00:33:06.705 --> 00:33:07.865
My sword hasn't even left its sheath.

00:33:07.945 --> 00:33:09.265
Why such harsh words, Miss Ling?

00:33:14.745 --> 00:33:16.145
I've always been one

00:33:16.225 --> 00:33:18.545
to see the whole
picture from a single clue.

00:33:18.625 --> 00:33:21.105
-Have you perhaps misunderstood me?
-My apologies.

00:33:21.185 --> 00:33:23.065
Guards, see him out.

00:33:25.185 --> 00:33:27.265
I've long admired Fenglai Pavilion.

00:33:27.345 --> 00:33:28.945
I truly wish to join.

00:33:30.785 --> 00:33:32.825
Fenglai Pavilion's
fame spreads far and wide.

00:33:32.905 --> 00:33:35.225
Many wish to join in earnest,

00:33:36.105 --> 00:33:37.145
but I can't possibly
accept everyone, can I?

00:33:38.745 --> 00:33:40.305
Luo, see him out.

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:42.025
You made the rules,

00:33:42.105 --> 00:33:43.065
yet now you break your own word.

00:33:43.665 --> 00:33:46.745
I doubt this place will amount to much.

00:33:52.105 --> 00:33:54.585
The Emperor went to
Southern Chu under the pretext

00:33:55.185 --> 00:33:56.305
of convalescence?

00:33:57.465 --> 00:33:59.465
I underestimated him.

00:34:00.265 --> 00:34:03.545
Could it be
that he went after Ling Cangcang?

00:34:04.665 --> 00:34:05.545
What else could it be?

00:34:07.585 --> 00:34:10.784
Xiao Huan has truly grown bold.

00:34:10.865 --> 00:34:12.225
He wants to rule on his own.

00:34:14.105 --> 00:34:15.625
Send word to Qing.

00:34:15.705 --> 00:34:18.505
Tell him to win Ling Cangcang's heart

00:34:18.585 --> 00:34:19.425
while she's in Southern Chu.

00:34:22.065 --> 00:34:24.985
The Ninth Prince is brilliant
in both strategy and battle…

00:34:27.264 --> 00:34:29.744
Your Highness, these are the most
popular designs at present.

00:34:30.264 --> 00:34:32.025
…But he never bows to anyone.

00:34:32.105 --> 00:34:35.744
Asking him to fawn
over a spoiled, willful girl

00:34:35.824 --> 00:34:38.185
might be difficult.

00:34:38.744 --> 00:34:40.225
In my humble opinion,

00:34:40.865 --> 00:34:41.985
it would be better

00:34:42.065 --> 00:34:45.065
to make sure the Emperor
never returns from this trip.

00:34:46.185 --> 00:34:47.264
Of course I choose the peacock.

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:49.025
I'm getting this tattoo

00:34:49.105 --> 00:34:50.705
only so the young
ladies will stay away from me.

00:34:50.784 --> 00:34:52.744
That way, I'll have an excuse
when Mother presses me to marry.

00:34:53.385 --> 00:34:54.744
You fool,

00:34:54.824 --> 00:34:57.065
do you want me to tattoo
a dragon and tiger in combat

00:34:57.825 --> 00:35:01.865
so the whole world thinks
I'm challenging the Emperor?

00:35:02.865 --> 00:35:04.225
My apologies. I wouldn't dare.

00:35:04.865 --> 00:35:06.625
Forget it. As for Ling Cangcang,

00:35:06.705 --> 00:35:08.185
as long as she stays out of my sight,

00:35:08.265 --> 00:35:10.105
I'll pretend I never saw her.

00:35:10.185 --> 00:35:11.225
SPLENDID TAILOR SHOP

00:35:11.305 --> 00:35:12.825
SPLENDID FINERY

00:35:12.905 --> 00:35:13.825
Welcome.

00:35:15.665 --> 00:35:17.625
This won't do. It's too plain.

00:35:17.705 --> 00:35:18.665
Do you have something more elegant?

00:35:18.745 --> 00:35:19.785
You could have it custom-made,

00:35:19.865 --> 00:35:22.185
but it would take about a month.

00:35:24.345 --> 00:35:26.505
Miss Ling,
we still haven't found a hall master.

00:35:26.585 --> 00:35:27.585
How can we carry out the plan?

00:35:27.665 --> 00:35:29.425
I already have someone in mind.

00:35:29.505 --> 00:35:30.465
For now, the priority

00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:32.225
is to get our hands on
the Prince of Yuzhang's clothes.

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:36.785
Do you have anything ready-made?
We need it urgently.

00:35:36.865 --> 00:35:39.025
To tell the truth, Miss Ling, a while ago,

00:35:39.105 --> 00:35:40.545
a servant from
the Prince of Yuzhang's Manor

00:35:40.625 --> 00:35:42.585
ordered a casual outfit for the Prince,

00:35:42.665 --> 00:35:45.065
but for some reason,
they never came to collect it.

00:35:45.145 --> 00:35:47.585
In that case, let us take that one.

00:35:47.665 --> 00:35:48.905
Well, I can't…

00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:52.345
I suppose I can do that.

00:35:53.145 --> 00:35:54.745
All right, I'll do as you say.

00:35:55.985 --> 00:35:57.145
Much obliged.

00:35:59.465 --> 00:36:01.105
I've never worn anything like this.

00:36:01.185 --> 00:36:03.985
Perhaps
someone else should try it on instead.

00:36:06.905 --> 00:36:09.385
Luo,
you're not just here to try on clothes.

00:36:09.465 --> 00:36:10.745
I'm

00:36:11.665 --> 00:36:13.425
counting on you for the task.

00:36:15.425 --> 00:36:18.505
Sir, that outfit was made for the Prince!

00:36:19.665 --> 00:36:20.505
The outfit

00:36:21.505 --> 00:36:22.345
for the Prince?

00:36:26.345 --> 00:36:27.745
Wait! Please wait!

00:36:27.825 --> 00:36:29.425
That outfit was
custom-made for the Prince.

00:36:29.505 --> 00:36:30.905
How could you just put it on and leave?

00:36:32.985 --> 00:36:34.585
I like it.

00:36:34.665 --> 00:36:35.985
It suits me quite well.

00:36:37.505 --> 00:36:38.905
I'll pay handsomely for it.

00:36:45.025 --> 00:36:46.385
Well, in that case…

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:49.585
What are you after, really?
Why are you following us?

00:36:54.385 --> 00:36:55.625
You again?

00:36:57.105 --> 00:36:59.825
Sorry, but we bought that outfit.

00:37:00.545 --> 00:37:01.665
You'll have to take it off.

00:37:04.585 --> 00:37:05.505
Wait!

00:37:42.305 --> 00:37:43.705
Don't ruin the outfit!

00:37:43.785 --> 00:37:45.745
That's Shu brocade!

00:37:45.825 --> 00:37:47.705
Miss Ling, please stop them!

00:37:51.425 --> 00:37:53.185
You want this outfit that badly?

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:55.385
Listen,

00:37:55.465 --> 00:37:58.105
if you let me join Fenglai Pavilion,
I'll give it to you.

00:38:05.465 --> 00:38:07.385
Luo, forget it.

00:38:08.305 --> 00:38:09.985
There's more than one
tailor shop in Southern Chu.

00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:12.465
Let's go.

00:38:16.185 --> 00:38:17.785
Do you really hate
the idea of me joining that much?

00:38:18.865 --> 00:38:21.665
Then tell me,
why are you so eager to join?

00:38:22.665 --> 00:38:24.345
I was born defiant.
I never accept defeat easily.

00:38:24.425 --> 00:38:26.305
What a coincidence. Neither do I.

00:38:42.865 --> 00:38:44.545
What exactly is Ling Cangcang after?

00:38:44.625 --> 00:38:46.025
Have you found anything?

00:38:46.105 --> 00:38:47.625
She's always with Luo Xianxue,

00:38:48.465 --> 00:38:51.025
but Zhong Lin's been
going outside the city often.

00:38:51.105 --> 00:38:51.945
Where exactly?

00:38:52.785 --> 00:38:54.785
-Near the Southern Chu mine.
-The mine?

00:38:55.585 --> 00:38:58.225
So she's after more than just clothes.

00:38:58.825 --> 00:38:59.865
Shi Yan,

00:38:59.945 --> 00:39:01.945
I want to know everything about that mine.

00:39:02.985 --> 00:39:03.825
Understood.

00:39:05.345 --> 00:39:06.265
Ling Cangcang,

00:39:06.905 --> 00:39:08.705
why did you cast aside the Empress's seat?

00:39:09.345 --> 00:39:10.825
What is it that you truly want?

00:39:27.985 --> 00:39:28.865
Master.

00:39:31.425 --> 00:39:32.345
Pear blossom honey?

00:39:32.425 --> 00:39:34.465
I knew it.

00:39:34.545 --> 00:39:36.905
No one understands me better than you.

00:39:39.825 --> 00:39:41.905
Master, let me pour you some tea.

00:39:43.385 --> 00:39:44.345
Here.

00:39:44.425 --> 00:39:46.785
You haven't visited me at
the Sword Cottage for a long time.

00:39:46.865 --> 00:39:48.785
What have you been up to?

00:39:49.825 --> 00:39:51.585
Nothing escapes you, Master.

00:39:51.665 --> 00:39:53.745
A mine has recently yielded iron ore,

00:39:54.465 --> 00:39:56.785
an extremely rare
metal for forging swords.

00:39:57.625 --> 00:39:58.865
Whoever obtains it

00:39:59.505 --> 00:40:00.625
will make their name
across the martial world.

00:40:00.705 --> 00:40:02.825
You still dream of
roaming the martial world?

00:40:02.905 --> 00:40:04.065
Don't forget, you are destined

00:40:04.745 --> 00:40:06.385
to become Empress someday.

00:40:08.425 --> 00:40:10.425
I don't care for that title.

00:40:11.225 --> 00:40:13.745
I just want to win someone's heart
and roam the world

00:40:14.665 --> 00:40:15.585
with my sword.

00:40:17.585 --> 00:40:18.425
Cangcang,

00:40:19.025 --> 00:40:21.705
there are few things in this world
that turn out as one wishes.

00:40:22.385 --> 00:40:24.825
May your joy at
least last a little longer.

00:40:26.145 --> 00:40:29.585
EXEMPLARY VIRTUE

00:40:29.665 --> 00:40:31.225
Cangcang, we've got the clothes.

00:40:39.905 --> 00:40:40.945
Turn around.

00:40:43.865 --> 00:40:47.385
Miss Ling, something feels off.

00:40:50.465 --> 00:40:52.545
It's missing a bit of
the Prince of Yuzhang's…

00:40:52.625 --> 00:40:53.665
Nobility!

00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:55.945
Exactly.

00:41:14.385 --> 00:41:15.425
Hands behind your back.

00:41:17.385 --> 00:41:18.225
Stand straighter.

00:41:19.625 --> 00:41:20.625
A little more.

00:41:21.905 --> 00:41:23.545
Yes, remember this posture.

00:41:24.305 --> 00:41:25.745
Now you look eighty percent like him.

00:41:28.825 --> 00:41:31.545
The Prince needs a tattoo artist.

00:41:31.625 --> 00:41:33.385
We can…

00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:42.825
Your Highness, they've arrived.

00:41:44.145 --> 00:41:45.545
Liubao says your skills are unmatched.

00:41:45.625 --> 00:41:47.665
You must tattoo

00:41:47.745 --> 00:41:50.305
the most magnificent
peacock in Great Qi for me.

00:41:50.385 --> 00:41:51.505
Yes, Your Highness.

00:41:52.105 --> 00:41:52.945
Begin.

00:42:01.625 --> 00:42:03.265
It might sting a little.

00:42:03.345 --> 00:42:05.905
Pain is nothing. Hurry up.

00:42:09.025 --> 00:42:10.225
Didn't you say you weren't afraid of pain?

00:42:11.985 --> 00:42:13.745
Shall I have my
assistant fetch a paperweight?

00:42:13.825 --> 00:42:16.025
You can squeeze it if it hurts.

00:42:16.105 --> 00:42:17.905
-Go. Hurry.
-Yes, Your Highness.

00:42:24.225 --> 00:42:25.705
A golden embroidered box?

00:42:25.785 --> 00:42:26.625
That must be it.

00:42:28.825 --> 00:42:30.425
Your Highness, here's the paperweight.

00:42:31.185 --> 00:42:32.185
Hold it firmly.

00:43:14.905 --> 00:43:17.545
After I dotted the eye,
the phoenix immediately came to life.

00:43:17.625 --> 00:43:20.145
Bear with it a little longer.
I'm almost finished.

00:43:20.225 --> 00:43:22.905
I asked for a peacock!

00:43:24.985 --> 00:43:26.665
When a peacock rests
upon the Azure Dragon's back,

00:43:26.745 --> 00:43:28.105
it takes on the grace of a phoenix.

00:43:28.185 --> 00:43:30.105
Your Highness's
nobility is truly overwhelming.

00:43:34.105 --> 00:43:36.105
I was momentarily distracted by awe.

00:43:36.185 --> 00:43:37.825
I'll put my utmost care into this.

00:43:37.905 --> 00:43:38.745
Let's continue.

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:49.745
Your Highness, the peacock is complete.

00:43:51.145 --> 00:43:52.185
Complete?

00:43:53.345 --> 00:43:55.465
-Already?
-Yes.

00:43:56.065 --> 00:43:58.065
It looks stunning on your back,

00:43:58.665 --> 00:43:59.825
almost alive.

00:44:06.665 --> 00:44:07.945
Truly.

00:44:09.105 --> 00:44:11.545
You two, bring me a bronze mirror.

00:44:11.625 --> 00:44:12.505
I want to see for myself.

00:44:13.625 --> 00:44:14.505
Sure. I'll fetch one.

00:44:15.625 --> 00:44:16.465
Hurry.

00:44:21.785 --> 00:44:22.905
The mold's ready.

00:44:22.985 --> 00:44:23.905
Can you really reproduce it?

00:44:23.985 --> 00:44:25.865
Trust me. I'm Zhong Lin.

00:44:25.945 --> 00:44:27.385
It'll be identical,
down to the finest detail.

00:44:27.465 --> 00:44:28.825
Miss!

00:44:28.905 --> 00:44:31.105
A mister bought these flowers for you.

00:44:32.545 --> 00:44:33.585
Who?

00:44:34.865 --> 00:44:35.985
Him again?
