=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.900
=Episode 14=

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.750
You don't need to change into slippers.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:21.160
I'm mopping the floor.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.800
Okay.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.279
Look at you.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.759
You should tell Zhang Hao
to do the chores.

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.119
He has done enough.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.360
Fine.

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:32.039
Zhixia.

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:35.839
I suppose you heard about the dowry

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:37.060
Bichen's family was demanding.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.839
They demanded 200,000 yuan.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.600
Of course, it isn't just a dowry.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.720
They'll keep the money

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:44.600
for the couple

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.240
in the future.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.240
Mainly, their family

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.000
wants to test

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.640
our sincerity.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.360
You see,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.839
your dad and I already tried our best.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.720
We still lack 100,000 yuan.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.119
I was thinking if you could

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.679
help your younger brother out.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.439
Look at the entrance of your unit.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.920
On it, there's a saying called

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.719
"A harmonious family brings prosperity".

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.480
Anyway, your brother's marriage

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.640
is our priority now.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.950
Looking for my sister is your priority.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.010
Now, my brother's marriage
is your priority as well.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.679
There are so many priorities
in the family.

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:29.580
Whenever that happens,
you demand money from me.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.439
The thing is, I'm not wealthy.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.439
And, my siblings aren't that poor.

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.920
Zhixia,

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.480
to think that you actually
watched the TV.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.999
According to the news,

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.040
society has eradicated poverty.

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:03.999
You see,

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.640
regarding your brother's marriage,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.360
you should help us out
for the time being.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.559
Once he holds his wedding

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.080
and we receive all of the gift money,

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.800
I'll tell him to return the money
to you immediately.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.679
Is that okay?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.719
I thought Xu Zhidong
was tough and stubborn.

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:20.559
"Xu Zhixia!

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.399
from now on, stay out of my affairs!"

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.719
I'll grant him his wish.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.080
Hey, you...

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.679
Zhixia...

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.150
It's fine if he wants to
borrow money from me.

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.279
Tell Xu Zhidong to approach me himself.

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:33.040
He can beg me personally.

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:35.719
You're his eldest sister, you know?

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.839
You should help him out
during crucial moments.

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:39.950
I'm still pregnant, you know?

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.320
I want to move to another unit.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.040
I want to depend on my connection
to make Zhang Hao an HOD.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.999
I'm going through
crucial moments every day.

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:47.520
Who's going to help me out, then?

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.839
Hey, Xu Zhixia, you...

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.950
I only realized this by now.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.599
How could you be this heartless?

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.200
That's right.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.520
I am heartless.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.080
And, you favor sons over daughters.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.999
I...

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.399
You broke my heart.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.719
I cherish all of my children equally.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.240
You guys are siblings.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.960
You guys should be
supporting each other...

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.359
Mom, you can't just throw me
into the abyss

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.799
just to help your son.

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:20.560
No.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.110
I mean, throw me
and my sister into the abyss.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.880
I wouldn't dare
to acknowledge you either

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.399
if I were Shen Mingzhu.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.120
Fine.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.510
The jade accessories we sell are
all exquisite and flawless.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.919
Every bangle here is unique.

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.279
See if you like any of the designs.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.630
We don't really know how to choose them.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.960
Are all of them this expensive?

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.080
So...

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.399
Why don't we try on the 29,800 one?

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.680
Sure. Madam, please wait.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.279
Mom.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.960
The 100,000 one looks great.

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:55.080
This one?

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.060
- That's right.
- Boy.

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:57.960
You have excellent taste.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.520
This is definitely a great deal.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.599
It's a rare piece.

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:01.799
You see?

00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:02.880
Did you even see the price?

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:04.799
Madam, here. Try this.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.560
It's fine.

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:07.520
Do you like it?

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.200
Actually, I think this looks great.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.880
Yeah, right?

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.399
It's pretty nice.

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:13.950
What if we compare this to the one
Jianqi's mother is wearing?

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.430
Mom, hers costs
70,000 yuan more than yours.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.159
You...

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.620
If you want to buy one,
you should buy a good one.

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.919
Don't you agree?

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.719
But I think...

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:22.560
Miss, what about this?

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.760
Take out the ones over 60,000,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.680
70,000, 90,000,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.239
just take all of them out.

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:28.000
We'll try them on.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.960
Alright, mister.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.760
Let's give it a try.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.200
Just try all of them on.

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:32.479
Yeah, Madam.

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:34.239
We're having a promotion today.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.120
There's a discount.

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:37.239
A discount?

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:37.799
That's right.

00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:39.159
How much after the discount?

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.640
It's 88,000 yuan after the discount.

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.200
You see?
They're even giving us a discount.

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:44.479
Hey.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.640
Give me a moment.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.560
That's not it.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.200
What?

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.880
That thing costs 88,000 yuan.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.440
And, I can't wear it when I work.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.760
Miss.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.320
Can I take a picture of it?

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.520
I can't wear it when I work.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.200
And, what if I break it by accident?

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.680
You're doing this again.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.880
We're not wealthy.
There's no need to compare with them.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.680
We rarely come here, you know?

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.640
Why are you worrying so much?

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.450
Madam, Mister is trying to buy one for you

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.680
as a token of his appreciation.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.960
You shouldn't stop him.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.039
I appreciate his intention.

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:10.159
Give me the money if you have that much.

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:11.120
I know where to spend it.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.260
I have all the money in the world.

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.430
But you're keeping all of it.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.080
As if.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.560
Besides, it's not that much.

00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:17.000
We can earn it back anyway.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.950
Mister, excellent words.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.719
Just try it on.

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:22.880
What's wrong with you today?

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.359
You must be having a fever.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.680
He's spouting nonsense.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.239
You see, we're busy later.

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:29.560
Let's go. She has other customers.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.750
We're leaving already?
We rarely come here though.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.440
Let's hurry.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.520
Will you actually buy it?

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.039
Why not?

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.799
It's 88,000 yuan, you know?

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:38.839
I'll buy it for your mother
even if it's 800,000 yuan.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.399
So, Madam,

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:43.359
are you buying the bangle?

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:45.440
We'll come back tomorrow.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.640
- That's not it.
- We'll discuss it first.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.399
Madam, the bangle is on your hand.

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:51.719
You're leaving the shop with it.

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:54.260
- You see...
- What was that?

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.440
- Sorry about that.
- It's fine.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.159
It's fine.

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:57.919
- Sorry about that.
- Just hand it to me.

00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:59.080
I didn't do it on purpose.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.880
You can consider it.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.799
Yeah, I'll consider it.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.039
We'll head back and discuss it first.

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:02.880
We'll come again tomorrow.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.359
Dad, let's go.

00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:03.919
We'll come again.

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.200
The discount will be over by next week.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.000
Please consider it.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.599
- We'll come again tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:08.520
Hey, you...

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.520
I think I understand now.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.170
Understand what?

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.359
It's tiring to buy something for you.
- That's not it.

00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:17.200
In reality, buying accessories that can
be passed down to our descendants

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:18.120
isn't worth it at all.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:20.680
You'll run the risk of losing it.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.120
And, you might break it by accident.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.799
In my opinion,

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:26.120
there's nothing like the wisdom
passed down by our predecessors.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.359
Mom, what wisdom?

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.799
"A harmonious family brings prosperity".

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.919
What kind of wisdom is that?

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:32.520
And,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.640
"Study well and
strive to improve yourself".

00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:36.960
Got it.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.960
And,

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.399
"Never take back
the bangles we haven't bought."

00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:45.640
Mr. Feng, Mrs. Feng,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.839
dinner is ready.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.919
The vegetables today

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.320
were all organic vegetables

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.919
I bought from the farm.

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:56.520
You should have more.
It'll reduce blood pressure.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.350
- Alright.
- Meiqi.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.399
Time to eat.

00:07:58.399 --> 00:07:58.919
Coming.

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:01.479
I wonder what you're busy with recently.

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:02.919
You always came back late.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:05.640
It's rare that you're having dinner
with the family.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.880
You should eat more.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.640
One doesn't make money
by staying home, you know?

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.760
Go and get the door.

00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:13.760
Madam.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.399
It's fine. I'll get it.

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:18.399
Mingzhu.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.039
Mingzhu.

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.239
Come and eat.

00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:21.719
Okay.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.000
You're still on your phone.
Meiqi, stop that.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.599
I have a question for you.

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:33.999
How's your job search going?

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:35.519
I'm searching for one.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.239
You're brushing me off.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.359
Listen,

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:41.519
I want you to go to work

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:43.400
so that you can train yourself

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.359
in society.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.440
Don't you know how old you are?

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.160
A girl's prime years
only last that long.

00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:52.639
You should hurry.

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:54.479
Got it.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.759
Look at how hardworking Mingzhu is.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.950
She's still working
even though she's pregnant.

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:00.479
You see, my job

00:09:00.479 --> 00:09:01.519
isn't that technical.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:02.719
Meiqi should find a job

00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:04.040
that matches her major.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.519
Capable people can always find jobs

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.320
that match their majors.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:09.999
Dad,

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:12.800
I have something to discuss with you.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.560
Feng,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.359
you should finish this first.

00:09:16.359 --> 00:09:17.800
Okay. Go ahead.

00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:21.800
Now, every department has to meet

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.440
a sales target.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.239
Can you arrange more
of the receptions at Nanxi Hotel?

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.759
I've already topped up
my prepaid card there.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.280
Yes, I know that.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.040
You see,

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.680
can you top up

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.560
another few ten thousand yuan
if it's convenient for you?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200
Mr. Zhao said

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.479
our department is
at the bottom again this month.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.479
So, she works by bringing
her own money into the set, huh?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.359
Dad, I was just saying.

00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:50.960
It doesn't matter if you top up or not.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.970
Alright. I'll consider it.

00:09:52.119 --> 00:09:53.440
Great job.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.800
You're actually paying to work.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.359
Here, give it to me.

00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:58.879
Let's eat.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.599
Dad.

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:01.400
I'll find a job too.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.360
- You should top up my card for me too.
- Sure.

00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:04.920
I'll top it up for you immediately

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.119
as long as you find a job.

00:10:06.119 --> 00:10:08.519
I'll get a job immediately
as long as you top it up for me.

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:09.639
What nonsense are you saying?

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:10.920
Let's eat.

00:10:11.999 --> 00:10:13.120
You didn't hear it yourself.

00:10:13.359 --> 00:10:15.800
Mother-in-law and Meiqi
were ridiculing me.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.239
I couldn't stand it.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:19.200
Doing sales isn't about
doing forced deals.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.119
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:22.330
Just let your mother-in-law
ridicule you all she wants.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.950
Just take it as if
she's talking to herself.

00:10:24.239 --> 00:10:26.119
My mentality isn't as strong as yours.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.800
You're going to be a mother soon.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.160
You might not possess
certain skills in the past,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.680
but now, you have to pick them up.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.560
For example?

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.200
For example, how to be thick-skinned.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.639
How to be thick-skinned?

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.479
Xiu'e,

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.639
when we went

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:44.160
to pick a jade bangle today,

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.800
I picked the most expensive one

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.950
because I knew you couldn't bear
to spend the money.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.080
I was wondering what you were up to.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.719
"88,000 yuan? Just buy it."

00:10:51.719 --> 00:10:53.160
You were acting as if you were wealthy.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.239
So, you were tricking me.

00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:55.359
Who said I was tricking you?

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:56.800
Can you bear to buy it?

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.920
If you can, I'll definitely buy it for you.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.040
Such accessories are
meant for other people to see.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.550
They're expensive.
We shouldn't buy them casually.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.839
As long as we're leading a good life,

00:11:09.719 --> 00:11:11.239
and our children are doing well,

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:12.800
that's better than anything else.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.950
Hurry, customers are coming.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:19.800
Buddy,

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.000
you're actually
using this bike for your job.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.340
I'm sure it drinks oil like water.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.359
It does.

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:29.680
My son is getting married.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.759
I have no choice.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.759
I'm the same. My daughter just
got admitted into a university.

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:35.320
That's fine.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.250
I said I'd do
whatever job I could get at night.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.999
There are two of you?

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:42.239
Dacheng.

00:11:42.479 --> 00:11:43.359
We have a duo here.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.639
Go and find Dacheng.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.440
Mister, how much to Fengli?

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.040
Eight yuan.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.359
Isn't the base price six yuan?

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.999
Look at their bikes.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.280
They can only fetch one person per trip.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.400
But there are two of you.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.639
I can fetch both of you.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.839
Alright. Let's go then.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.680
Come on.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.560
Put on your helmets.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.400
Okay.

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:05.879
Okay.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.879
The trip costs six yuan, okay?

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:08.950
Where are you going?

00:12:09.119 --> 00:12:09.879
Okay?

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.950
The base price is six yuan.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.759
Sit tight.

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:12.359
Okay.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.719
Dacheng?

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:37.719
Why are you still awake
at this late hour?

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:40.560
I can't sleep without you.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.999
You didn't answer my calls either.

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:46.639
Where did you go?

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:49.479
Where else? I'm a useless fool.

00:12:49.479 --> 00:12:50.519
Dacheng.

00:12:52.119 --> 00:12:52.879
Look at your phone.

00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:00.839
Dacheng, where did you get the money?

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.719
You see,

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.879
I worked

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.759
as a motorcycle taxi driver.

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:13.839
Dacheng, you...

00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:16.560
Why did you do that?

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.759
I didn't mean to provoke you

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:21.920
with what I said in the afternoon.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.920
Dacheng.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.680
This is too tough on you.

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:28.680
I crave

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.879
poached egg in
sweet fermented rice with brown sugar.

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:39.119
You scared me.

00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:40.280
You didn't come back.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.320
I thought you weren't
coming back anymore.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.940
(You have received
100,000 yuan in your bank card.)

00:14:31.359 --> 00:14:32.080
Zhixia?

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.359
You truly are my little sweetheart.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:47.879
Zhixia,

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:50.040
I've received the money.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.080
I'll definitely tell your brother

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.440
to return the money to you later.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.320
Now,

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.280
he's going to get married.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.839
It's time for him to be independent.

00:15:28.999 --> 00:15:29.639
Mom.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.400
Tell Aunt to stop introducing
potential boyfriends to me.

00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:34.719
I enjoy being single.

00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:37.850
Did your aunt introduce
some boys to you?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.660
He was already married thrice.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.960
Married thrice?

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.320
I suppose he's almost my age.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.879
He's young.

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:48.839
What are you saying?

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.860
How could he be young
when he was already married thrice?

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:53.639
Youngsters nowadays can marry today
and get a divorce tomorrow.

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:54.759
After that, they'll do the same
the day after tomorrow.

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:55.599
And, he'll get married again.

00:15:55.599 --> 00:15:56.860
It's easy to go through
three marriages like that.

00:15:56.879 --> 00:15:57.800
Nonsense.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.320
I'll get the door.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.560
Hello.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.080
What are you doing here?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.960
I came all the way here
to thank you guys.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.230
There's nothing to thank us for.

00:16:16.479 --> 00:16:17.200
Please go home.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.450
I won't take up much of your time.

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:21.119
Madam,

00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:22.960
today's my son's birthday.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.960
When he made his wish,

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.200
he wished that the man
who saved him could...

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.200
My son was able to survive

00:16:32.879 --> 00:16:33.879
all thanks to you all.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.860
I have to come here
and thank you personally.

00:16:35.879 --> 00:16:37.879
Thank us? For what?

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:41.599
Will your thanks bring my son back?

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.879
Sorry about this.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.920
She's still heartbroken
about the incident.

00:16:48.719 --> 00:16:49.719
Please go back.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.280
Meiqi, see our guest off.

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:01.400
Please go home.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.479
Miss,

00:17:08.239 --> 00:17:09.160
I'm a father myself.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.960
Forget about experiencing the pain
of losing one's son,

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.480
even thinking about it
is enough to break my heart.

00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:18.719
Their son sacrificed himself

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.200
to save my son.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.719
I will be inhumane
if I don't do something in return.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.880
We can talk about it next time.

00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:26.440
Yeah.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.319
There's always time.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.120
It's fine that you remember what we did.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.279
But formalities are unnecessary.

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:35.239
You saw my parents as well.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.810
They finally started to
feel a little better.

00:17:39.079 --> 00:17:40.960
Please don't remind them of the tragedy.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.519
Your son is still young.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.640
Don't give him any emotional pressure.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:48.840
But everyone in your family

00:17:49.239 --> 00:17:50.319
is loving and kind.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.600
I have to do something in return.

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:53.880
No need for that.

00:17:57.279 --> 00:17:58.719
Raise your child well,

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.279
and let him live on
for my brother's sake.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.660
That's the best consolation
you can give us.

00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:06.600
Please head back.

00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:24.319
Feng.

00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:27.600
From now on, all festive occasions

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.519
have nothing to do with us.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.880
It's all my fault.

00:18:36.719 --> 00:18:40.160
I shouldn't have agreed to
Jianqi's and Mingzhu's relationship.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.680
If so, he wouldn't have moved out.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.840
And, he wouldn't need to rescue the boy.

00:18:50.479 --> 00:18:51.880
If so, he wouldn't have died.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.680
Mr. Guan,

00:18:57.799 --> 00:18:58.920
please follow Meiqi's advice.

00:18:59.479 --> 00:19:00.680
Please don't come again.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.160
If not,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.670
it'll cause both parties to be upset.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.120
You see,

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.960
I topped up 100,000 yuan in
my Nanxi Hotel prepaid card.

00:19:12.479 --> 00:19:13.440
I put you as my referral.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.440
You shouldn't have done that.
Why did you do so?

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.160
I know.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.330
Everyone in the hotel
has a sales target to hit.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.670
The money will be of use to me anyway.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.850
I can use it to treat my clients
and family to a meal anyway.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.950
I'll look for you
when I need to book a room there.

00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:27.719
Sure. No problem.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:31.999
Thank you.

00:19:32.479 --> 00:19:33.479
Please don't say that.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.600
I don't deserve

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.360
your thanks.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.079
I'll say the same thing.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.479
Just look for me if you need any help.

00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:43.440
I'll definitely help you out if I can.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.160
Okay.

00:19:59.319 --> 00:20:00.440
I think you went overboard.

00:20:01.759 --> 00:20:02.759
What do you mean?

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.550
My brother didn't expect anything
in return when he saved his son.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.279
Even my parents didn't
ask for anything in return.

00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:08.650
What gives you the right to do so?

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.799
It's not me. It's Mr. Guan...

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:11.719
You could've refused him.

00:20:11.719 --> 00:20:13.239
Why were you playing hard-to-get, then?

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.039
It's like this.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.160
Before this,

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.400
my superiors in the hotel
took great care of me.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.840
I want to help them
to improve their sales.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.920
By doing this?

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.960
By feeding on my brother's kindness?

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.039
Don't you think that's too much?

00:20:36.239 --> 00:20:37.079
Shen Mingzhu!

00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:38.319
My mother was right!

00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:39.279
My brother is a hero!

00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:40.680
You're not good enough for him!

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.239
Feng Meiqi, listen up.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.960
You don't get to decide
if I'm good enough for your brother.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.759
Your mother doesn't
get to decide that either.

00:20:53.759 --> 00:20:55.519
Only Jianqi can decide that for himself.

00:20:56.719 --> 00:20:58.160
You think I'm too much?

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.920
Perhaps I would think the same of myself

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.440
going several months back.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.880
But now,

00:21:04.479 --> 00:21:05.640
I don't have a husband.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.160
I'm pregnant as well.

00:21:07.519 --> 00:21:08.759
I have to think about

00:21:08.759 --> 00:21:11.370
how to make money, save up money,
and make more money all day long.

00:21:12.239 --> 00:21:14.360
I have to
make preparations for my child.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.039
I don't care about my dignity.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.999
I don't care how lowly I have to look.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.759
I'm a mother.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.400
For my child's sake,

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.200
I'm not afraid of falling out with you.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.360
I'm not afraid of falling out
with everyone I know!

00:21:37.239 --> 00:21:37.960
Jianqi.

00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:40.999
Your sister said
the same thing about me.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.160
And, I've held it in.

00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:45.200
I kept my promise, didn't I?

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.880
But listen up,

00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:52.200
I'm done with this.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.920
Motorcycle taxi?

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.640
It was this cheap before.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.400
Motorcycle taxi.

00:22:00.479 --> 00:22:01.920
Five yuan is too cheap for us.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.319
My bike has a third wheel.

00:22:03.319 --> 00:22:04.680
I can fetch both of you.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.239
Mister, how much to Wangjiang Hotel?

00:22:06.239 --> 00:22:06.719
Eight yuan.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.880
Okay, come.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.960
Over here.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.600
Over here.

00:22:12.319 --> 00:22:13.200
Over here.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.079
Five yuan.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.440
Here, put on your helmets.

00:22:16.759 --> 00:22:17.920
Here, put them on.

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:19.160
Okay.

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:23.680
Motorcycle taxi.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.440
Nobody moves!

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:31.880
Do you guys know that this is illegal?

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.200
Passengers, get off the bike.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:35.920
Your driving license.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.279
Stop right there!

00:22:40.479 --> 00:22:41.400
Stop right there!

00:22:44.719 --> 00:22:45.360
Watch out!

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.060
(Shen's Restaurant)

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.279
Why are you calling so late?
What's the matter?

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.460
Did you get into a fight again?

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.039
You're too old for that.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.600
What are you thinking?

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.920
No, I just slipped and fell.

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:39.479
Didn't you once say

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.880
you have a friend in the traffic police?

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.260
You weren't exaggerating, were you?

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.880
Why would I?

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.440
When I was learning to ride a motorbike,

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.360
I told you,

00:23:47.479 --> 00:23:49.239
I know plenty of traffic officers.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.440
That's great then.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.160
Take a look at this.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.079
What's that?

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.826
The police

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.400
seized my sidecar.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.160
That bike means everything to me.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.880
Can you talk to your friend

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.160
and get it released?

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.279
What do you mean?

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.120
You want me to help you

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.200
get your sidecar back?

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.440
Oh come on, seriously.

00:24:12.319 --> 00:24:12.999
Shen,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.840
you'll definitely get it back.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.120
But we have to follow procedure.

00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:18.160
Of course.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.440
Sign here,

00:24:23.759 --> 00:24:25.060
then pay the fine on your phone.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.440
You can collect your bike afterwards.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.600
All done on the phone?

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.120
Yes.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.160
Alright.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.840
By the way, Shen,

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:32.759
let me remind you of something.

00:24:33.319 --> 00:24:35.759
Xu Dacheng has been in prison before.

00:24:36.079 --> 00:24:37.200
If you're friends with him,

00:24:37.719 --> 00:24:39.039
be careful.

00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:40.360
Got it.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:47.140
(Accident Processing Center)

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.200
Mr. Shen.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.759
You actually got it done.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.719
No trouble at all.

00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:00.840
Perfect.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:02.880
I'll treat you to dinner sometime.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.759
Dinner? Don't bother.

00:25:03.759 --> 00:25:04.600
Go on home.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.719
Your wife's waiting for you.

00:25:05.719 --> 00:25:07.079
You're a good man.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.719
With my daughter staying with you,

00:25:09.719 --> 00:25:10.719
I can rest easy.

00:25:10.719 --> 00:25:11.759
Your daughter?

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.960
She's my daughter.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.840
Fine, she's your daughter.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.440
Let me show you a secret.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.920
Look at this line.

00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:33.079
Don't overthink it.

00:25:33.759 --> 00:25:34.920
It's just a secret.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.200
You know it, and I know it.

00:25:37.479 --> 00:25:38.559
Even my wife doesn't know.

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:39.360
Alright?

00:25:39.759 --> 00:25:40.479
I'm off now.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.319
Zhixia.

00:25:59.799 --> 00:26:02.840
Mr. Zhao has already gone to talk
with the head of the Catering Department.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.200
I'm not sure how much help it'll be,

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.400
but we'll do our best.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.600
Mingzhu, thank you so much.

00:26:09.079 --> 00:26:10.999
You're more thoughtful
than my own brother.

00:26:10.999 --> 00:26:11.640
Truly.

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:14.440
Sorry, you're like my sister too.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.920
I'm so happy
I can't even speak properly.

00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:18.600
It's fine.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.640
Once there's news,

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.200
I'll let you know right away.

00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:22.519
Alright, goodbye.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.559
You go on, you're busy.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.519
Not really.

00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:27.719
I was just on the phone with Zhixia.

00:26:28.279 --> 00:26:28.960
Really?

00:26:30.079 --> 00:26:31.160
What brings you here?

00:26:31.239 --> 00:26:31.799
I...

00:26:33.479 --> 00:26:34.200
I came

00:26:35.239 --> 00:26:37.360
to bring you some strawberries.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.840
They're homegrown.

00:26:39.519 --> 00:26:40.440
Completely organic.

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:41.640
Your dad...

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.120
I mean,

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.120
Xu picked them

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.600
at his sister's place.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.479
All organic, go ahead and eat.

00:26:49.479 --> 00:26:50.840
Don't worry, they're safe.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.479
No,

00:26:51.759 --> 00:26:53.239
you should keep them for yourselves.

00:26:53.239 --> 00:26:54.279
There's plenty, really.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.840
I'll take some to Zhixia later.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.960
Let me see, this one,

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.079
this one looks nice.

00:26:58.079 --> 00:26:59.039
Here, take this.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.440
No, that one's bad.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.240
- It's alright, I'll take it.
- No worries.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.559
I'll swap it for a better one.

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:05.430
Here, this one's good.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.440
I won't keep you any longer.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.799
You should get back to work.

00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:15.360
I'm not busy.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.799
I'm off work today.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.239
You've finished?

00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:20.360
Then…

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.880
Shall we walk together?

00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:25.400
Sure.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.799
Here, let me.

00:27:26.999 --> 00:27:27.680
I'll take it.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.880
- How have you been lately?
- I'm good, really good.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:30.759
Give it to me.

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:31.999
I'll carry it. No, I'll do it.

00:27:31.999 --> 00:27:33.239
You shouldn't carry that.

00:27:33.239 --> 00:27:34.079
Take care

00:27:34.079 --> 00:27:35.880
of yourself, alright?

00:27:43.999 --> 00:27:44.519
Dad.

00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:47.600
What happened? Did you fight again?

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.279
I'm too old for fighting.

00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:53.200
I just fell.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.060
That could get infected easily.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.220
- Come on, I'll take you to the hospital.
- No need.

00:27:57.239 --> 00:27:58.279
Come here, son.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.519
Let me ask you something.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.479
At the train station,

00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:04.999
there are lots of people
giving motorbike rides, right?

00:28:05.759 --> 00:28:07.360
If they get caught by the police,

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.319
how much is the fine?

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.559
Usually around three to five thousand.

00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:15.160
Three thousand?

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.440
Why do you ask?

00:28:17.479 --> 00:28:19.460
You're not planning
to do illegal rides, are you?

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:19.999
No.

00:28:20.719 --> 00:28:21.680
Just curious.

00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:23.840
There's no "curious" about fines.

00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:25.400
They have set standards.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.719
But if you know someone inside,

00:28:27.719 --> 00:28:29.279
can they reduce it a bit?

00:28:29.479 --> 00:28:30.740
This is a country ruled by law.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.230
Trying that will only cause trouble.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.519
Then they didn't find the right person.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:36.799
Zhidong.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.360
Xu Zhidong.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.120
Come quick.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.279
Your brother-in-law
bought another pile of discount eggs.

00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:43.120
Give them to me.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:43.999
Zhixia's here.

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:45.279
Come in.

00:28:45.759 --> 00:28:46.360
Dad.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:48.039
What happened to your leg? Did you fall?

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.750
- How did that happen?
- It's fine.

00:28:49.759 --> 00:28:50.519
I'm fine.

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:51.840
Zhixia, you know what?

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.759
Your dad has finally learned
to take care of the family.

00:28:55.079 --> 00:28:56.279
He's been riding that sidecar

00:28:56.279 --> 00:28:58.440
to the station to make some money.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.920
It's really tiring.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.799
One slip and he fell over.

00:29:02.519 --> 00:29:03.960
Why do you even need to earn money?

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.840
Is this for Xu Zhidong again,
for his wedding?

00:29:09.479 --> 00:29:10.079
If you two

00:29:10.079 --> 00:29:12.039
keep meddling in Xu Zhidong's marriage,

00:29:13.079 --> 00:29:14.239
return the 100,000 yuan to me.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.239
Give it back to me.

00:29:16.239 --> 00:29:17.039
No.

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:17.880
We won't.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.999
No, we won't.

00:29:18.999 --> 00:29:20.799
That sidecar
is dangerous enough as it is.

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:22.150
You're not allowed to ride it anymore.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.200
I've been riding it for years.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.200
It's fine.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.840
Exactly.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.660
If you stop your dad
from riding that sidecar,

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:28.440
it's the same as saying...

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.440
I said he can't ride, so he can't.

00:29:31.719 --> 00:29:32.519
Alright.

00:29:32.519 --> 00:29:33.719
You really worry me.

00:29:33.719 --> 00:29:34.600
Zhixia,

00:29:36.719 --> 00:29:38.360
about that paternity test,

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.759
it's been quite some time already.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.039
So,

00:29:42.239 --> 00:29:44.559
when will the results come out?

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:46.200
It's not that simple, actually.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:46.759
Mom.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.920
You see, a paternity test

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.559
can only be done

00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:52.360
if both parties agree.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:52.920
Right?

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.719
We only took a few strands of hair.

00:29:54.719 --> 00:29:55.239
That's right.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.680
That's not proper procedure.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.479
Besides, we think it's
about recognizing family,

00:29:59.479 --> 00:30:01.160
but they might not see it that way.

00:30:01.479 --> 00:30:02.160
So Mom,

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.759
we'll need more time.

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:04.999
- But...
- What my sister said

00:30:04.999 --> 00:30:06.920
is indeed a bit against the rules.

00:30:07.719 --> 00:30:08.239
Sweet.

00:30:08.759 --> 00:30:09.319
Then...

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.960
Listen to the kids.

00:30:11.079 --> 00:30:11.840
No, I...

00:30:12.079 --> 00:30:13.279
Mom, I know this matter

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:15.279
is a huge deal for our family.

00:30:15.999 --> 00:30:16.759
Don't worry.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.640
I've

00:30:18.239 --> 00:30:19.279
used every connection

00:30:19.279 --> 00:30:20.759
I possibly could.

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:23.279
I'll make sure to get this done
as soon as I can.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.840
Alright.

00:30:25.479 --> 00:30:25.960
Good.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.880
Alright, go cook.

00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:28.519
Okay.

00:30:28.519 --> 00:30:30.680
I'm going to stew some meat for us.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.799
Can I have a few bites first?

00:30:33.479 --> 00:30:34.079
I'm starving.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.519
Dad.

00:30:38.999 --> 00:30:39.600
That's fine.

00:30:40.319 --> 00:30:42.239
This time you did well,
you deserve praise.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.360
Mom's condition isn't good right now.

00:30:45.479 --> 00:30:47.200
If she finds out about the test results,

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.519
she'll lose control.

00:30:48.719 --> 00:30:50.079
So we need to keep it from her.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.920
Of course I know that.

00:30:53.479 --> 00:30:54.640
You can rest assured.

00:30:55.079 --> 00:30:57.279
This matter
will stay locked inside my stomach.

00:30:57.479 --> 00:30:58.640
I'll never tell your mother.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.519
Mom.

00:31:01.719 --> 00:31:03.479
Try this strawberry. It's organic.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.039
I don't want it.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:08.999
Meiqi, have some.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.279
I don't want it either.
It hurts my teeth.

00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:14.120
Then I'll eat it myself.

00:31:22.479 --> 00:31:23.519
Stop eating.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.920
Do you eat everything people give you?

00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:31.440
You're too trusting.

00:31:31.759 --> 00:31:33.920
Let me tell you,
for something to be called organic,

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.559
it has to be certified
by the state, you know?

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.400
Not everything grown at home

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.960
can be called organic.

00:31:56.559 --> 00:31:57.640
What did I say?

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.920
What did I just say?

00:32:01.279 --> 00:32:02.319
Always arguing with me.

00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:04.120
I told you not to eat it,
but you still did.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.479
And you just kept eating more.

00:32:05.479 --> 00:32:06.200
Go on then.

00:32:06.319 --> 00:32:07.640
Are you alright, Mingzhu?

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.600
What kind of relatives do you have?

00:32:11.759 --> 00:32:13.200
One brings baby bok choy,

00:32:13.479 --> 00:32:15.039
another sends rotten strawberries.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.360
They know you're pregnant now,
your body's delicate,

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.680
what are they trying to do?

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:20.360
Honestly.

00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:22.160
Why not send abalone or shark fin?

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.759
Mingzhu, you're bleeding!

00:32:26.239 --> 00:32:27.519
Get her to the hospital!

00:32:36.799 --> 00:32:37.319
See?

00:32:37.319 --> 00:32:38.840
All her test results look fine.

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:41.319
Doctor,

00:32:41.799 --> 00:32:43.319
but she vomited blood.

00:32:44.479 --> 00:32:44.999
Really.

00:32:44.999 --> 00:32:47.079
We saw her vomit blood
with our own eyes.

00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:47.840
That's right.

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:51.400
But honestly,

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.680
I don't feel unwell.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.079
Did you eat anything?

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.880
Not really.

00:32:57.999 --> 00:32:58.880
In the afternoon,

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.319
I had a glass of dragon fruit juice.

00:33:00.319 --> 00:33:01.279
Could that be related?

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:02.440
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.799
Now it all makes sense.

00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:06.200
It's fine.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:06.999
Mingzhu,

00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:09.079
you need to watch what you eat.

00:33:09.519 --> 00:33:10.759
The higher you go in life,

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.840
the more disciplined you should be.

00:33:13.999 --> 00:33:15.440
Meiqi, her water bottle.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.799
Here, have some water.

00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:19.510
Drink at least a hundred milliliters.

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:25.479
Are you running low
on folic acid tablets?

00:33:25.479 --> 00:33:26.519
I'll prescribe more for you.

00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:26.960
Alright.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.479
Keep drinking, that's not enough yet.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.479
Drink.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.479
Auntie, that's not really necessary.

00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:36.559
The last time I saw a pregnant woman
using a measuring cup

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:37.640
was at her fiftieth birthday.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.079
She's way too young for that.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.950
You don't understand.

00:33:41.239 --> 00:33:42.239
In our family,

00:33:42.319 --> 00:33:45.559
precision and accuracy are essential.

00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:47.799
Alright, let's go.

00:33:48.279 --> 00:33:48.759
The form.

00:33:48.759 --> 00:33:49.360
Thank you.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.479
Alright.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.360
Slowly, take your time.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.500
Say something if you need help.

00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:55.079
Dr. Li!

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.079
Out first, then in.

00:33:56.079 --> 00:33:57.319
Don't you have any manners?

00:33:57.319 --> 00:33:58.079
Come on, slowly.

00:33:58.079 --> 00:33:58.559
Are you OK?

00:33:58.559 --> 00:34:00.519
Take it easy, what's the rush?

00:34:00.519 --> 00:34:01.840
The test report is out.

00:34:01.999 --> 00:34:03.079
Close the door, please.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.140
(Xin City Grand Court)

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.920
I'm exhausted.

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:15.519
Take it slow, get some rest.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.479
Mingzhu,

00:34:20.479 --> 00:34:21.720
honestly, you too.

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:23.360
So many hospitals to choose from,

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.800
and you picked the People's Hospital.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.800
That place is a total mess.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.880
Too many people, so noisy.

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:30.840
And there are always queue jumpers.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.760
They weren't cutting in line.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.880
Of course they were.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.400
They almost knocked you over.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.999
They were just rushing
to show their report to the doctor.

00:34:37.999 --> 00:34:40.380
(Full-term foetus, stillbirth
Nanzhou People's Hospital, Dr. Li Jingzhe)

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:45.079
That Dr. Li Jingzhe
has been complained about for ages.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.679
He's caught up in a medical dispute.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.559
Really?

00:34:49.559 --> 00:34:51.240
He's actually in a medical dispute?

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:52.840
I told you,

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.760
he looks like a smooth talker.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.079
Totally irresponsible.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.880
You should switch hospitals, Mingzhu.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.479
Private hospitals are really good now.

00:34:59.479 --> 00:35:00.920
They have integrated delivery suites.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.360
The People's Hospital is fine.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.559
It's reputable and close to home.

00:35:05.199 --> 00:35:06.559
You don't have to change hospitals.

00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:08.880
But you must change
your attending doctor.

00:35:09.519 --> 00:35:11.320
Mom, I know about that incident.

00:35:11.559 --> 00:35:13.840
It was a case of placental abruption.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.880
The baby didn't survive.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.960
The family couldn't accept it,

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.559
so they hired troublemakers
to cause a scene at the hospital.

00:35:17.559 --> 00:35:18.679
When I went for a prenatal check-up,

00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:19.559
I ran into them too.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.800
It had nothing to do with Dr. Li.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.679
You know that?

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.840
You know it,

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.639
and you still let him treat you?

00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:27.340
You have to change your doctor.

00:35:29.079 --> 00:35:29.999
I'm not changing.

00:35:31.039 --> 00:35:32.400
My body, my decision.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.199
Your body, your decision?

00:35:34.559 --> 00:35:35.360
You're carrying

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.119
our Feng family's grandson.

00:35:37.679 --> 00:35:38.199
Mom,

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.320
even if he's your grandson,

00:35:40.679 --> 00:35:41.960
it's still my decision.

00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:43.079
Shen Mingzhu!

00:35:44.199 --> 00:35:45.760
Is that how you talk to me?

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:46.999
Now that Feng Jianqi's gone,

00:35:46.999 --> 00:35:48.920
you dare to speak to me like this?

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.760
How can you talk to my mom that way?

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.240
I've done everything for you,

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.559
given you the best of everything,
all for your sake.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.999
You could at least take my advice.

00:35:56.999 --> 00:35:57.840
Right?

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.800
I'm your mother-in-law.

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:04.079
And the grandmother
of the baby you're carrying.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.720
Alright, Mom.

00:36:09.479 --> 00:36:10.199
I'm sorry.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.199
From now on, I'll listen to you.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.920
Then quit your job.

00:36:15.479 --> 00:36:16.840
I can't quit.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.079
It's a job I genuinely enjoy.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.720
My work schedule
is regular and balanced,

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.199
and my boss looks after me.

00:36:23.199 --> 00:36:24.559
It's not tiring at all.

00:36:25.479 --> 00:36:26.559
Keeping busy

00:36:27.079 --> 00:36:28.920
helps me forget a lot of sad things.

00:36:33.039 --> 00:36:33.720
Fine.

00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:35.999
Keep working for now.

00:36:36.599 --> 00:36:38.720
But once you're due, you must quit.

00:36:41.639 --> 00:36:42.800
We'll see when the time comes.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.039
What do you mean, "we'll see"?

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.360
You have to quit.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.760
With that little salary you earn,

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.440
it's not even enough to hire a nanny.

00:36:50.599 --> 00:36:52.079
It's not about the salary.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.999
It's about selling the memberships.

00:36:53.999 --> 00:36:55.850
She'll do whatever it takes
to hit her targets.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:57.999
Meiqi.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.960
Every button on your clothes,

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.440
did you buy it with your own money?

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.479
When you went to Shanghai
for that interview,

00:37:04.479 --> 00:37:05.679
the business class tickets
there and back,

00:37:05.679 --> 00:37:06.840
did you pay for them yourself?

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:08.450
You don't earn a penny,

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.390
so what right do you have to
look down on someone who does?

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.100
You think because you quit
your job and came back to Nanzhou,

00:37:12.119 --> 00:37:13.599
this family owes you something?

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.999
Sorry, I owe you nothing.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.479
I only promised your brother that
since he looked after my brother,

00:37:17.479 --> 00:37:18.360
I'd look after you.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.559
What's going on?

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.559
Dad.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.640
What's all the noise about?

00:37:27.199 --> 00:37:28.559
Dad, you're back just in time.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.800
Please, have a seat.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.240
What happened?

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:43.800
There's something
I've wanted to say for a while.

00:37:45.479 --> 00:37:46.960
Because of Jianqi and the baby,

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.559
we became a family.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.559
I know how kind you've been to me,

00:37:51.559 --> 00:37:52.920
and I'm very grateful.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.360
But I don't need

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.840
so many expensive gifts.

00:37:56.039 --> 00:37:57.880
And I don't even like bird's nest soup.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.920
What I want is freedom.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.199
The freedom to wear
what I like, see who I want,

00:38:02.199 --> 00:38:03.880
and choose my own doctor.

00:38:06.039 --> 00:38:06.559
Mom,

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.960
to be honest,

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.400
many of the clothes
and shoes you bought me

00:38:10.679 --> 00:38:12.440
I sold and exchanged for gold bars.

00:38:12.559 --> 00:38:13.920
They'll be for the child's future.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.320
My family runs a small business.

00:38:18.039 --> 00:38:19.280
My mom taught me from young

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.360
to always be prepared.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.440
When you have money in hand,
your heart stays calm.

00:38:23.079 --> 00:38:24.360
Raising a child

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.400
will take a lot of money.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.720
I need to learn to plan carefully
and live wisely.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.800
I hope you can trust me.

00:38:31.159 --> 00:38:32.920
Since I've decided to have this baby,

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.039
I'll be a responsible mother.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.920
And since I've accepted
the bracelet you gave me,

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.720
I'll do my best

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.650
to fulfill everything
a daughter-in-law should.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.079
In that regard,

00:38:42.599 --> 00:38:45.079
it makes no difference
whether Jianqi is here or not.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.960
Let me introduce everyone.

00:38:55.479 --> 00:38:56.840
This is our new colleague,

00:38:57.519 --> 00:38:58.240
Feng Meiqi.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.199
Welcome, Feng Meiqi.
Please look after her, everyone.

00:39:00.199 --> 00:39:01.800
Hello, I'm Aiko.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.079
Welcome, welcome.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:04.240
Daisy.

00:39:05.479 --> 00:39:06.360
Hi, Meiqi.

00:39:06.559 --> 00:39:07.159
Steven.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:07.960
Hello.

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:09.199
Come, Meiqi.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.479
You can sit here.

00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:15.280
This is your staff card.

00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:17.760
These are the event plans
for our department,

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.880
and various reports.

00:39:18.906 --> 00:39:20.450
Get familiar with them
as soon as you can.

00:39:20.479 --> 00:39:22.720
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me anytime.

00:39:23.079 --> 00:39:23.860
Thank you, Samantha.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.840
Alright, get to work.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.479
Guys, I've started my new job.

00:39:39.479 --> 00:39:40.840
Dinner's on me this weekend.

00:40:00.519 --> 00:40:02.760
Rufeng Liquor
is brewed from pure grains,

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.720
so its quality is absolutely guaranteed.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.280
Director Ding.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.159
This is Miss Xu,

00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:10.960
Mingzhu's cousin.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.199
You know Mingzhu's
been performing well lately.

00:40:13.639 --> 00:40:15.840
Her cousin is quite capable too.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.559
As for Shen Mingzhu,

00:40:18.559 --> 00:40:19.519
she recently secured

00:40:19.519 --> 00:40:21.550
a deal worth over 200,000 yuan
for our department.

00:40:22.039 --> 00:40:23.199
So of course,

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.599
I'll give her some face.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.950
How about this?
Let the liquor enter the venue first.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.440
But whether it actually sells or not,

00:40:30.199 --> 00:40:31.159
I can't guarantee.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.199
Getting it into the venue alone
is already a big favour.

00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:36.679
I know the entry fees for liquor brands

00:40:36.679 --> 00:40:37.800
are usually quite high.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.360
We can't afford the fee,

00:40:40.599 --> 00:40:41.639
but rest assured,

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.840
we'll do our part.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.880
From now on, if Nanxi Hotel

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.440
needs any kind of publicity support,

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.240
come straight to me.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.199
I'll give it my all.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.119
Good.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.350
Let's work closely together from now on.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.440
Thank you, Director Ding.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.620
Looking forward to great cooperation.

00:40:52.639 --> 00:40:54.400
The two sisters are quite something.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.800
A once-in-a-lifetime chance.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.159
A once-in-a-lifetime chance.

00:41:00.519 --> 00:41:01.559
"Chance." Write that down.

00:41:01.679 --> 00:41:02.320
Chance.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:02.920
Yes.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.290
Enduring humiliation
for the greater good.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.119
Enduring humiliation
for the greater good.

00:41:07.199 --> 00:41:08.880
Back, straighten your back.

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:09.599
Right.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:10.960
Hao.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.360
Let me tell you something.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.519
Mingzhu is impressive.

00:41:15.559 --> 00:41:16.679
She got Rufeng Liquor

00:41:17.199 --> 00:41:18.800
into Nanxi Hotel.

00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:19.760
Really?

00:41:21.039 --> 00:41:22.639
Your sister's no ordinary woman.

00:41:22.639 --> 00:41:23.320
That's right.

00:41:23.639 --> 00:41:25.119
They sent the clever one away

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:26.639
and kept the simple one at home.

00:41:27.999 --> 00:41:30.159
I still don't know
what Grandma was thinking back then.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.039
It must have been a hard choice for her

00:41:34.159 --> 00:41:35.920
when she made that decision.

00:41:38.199 --> 00:41:39.039
Is that right?

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:41.760
Yes.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.599
Honey.

00:41:46.199 --> 00:41:49.039
Do you know
what first attracted me to you?

00:41:49.479 --> 00:41:50.800
Of course, it was my good looks.

00:41:51.199 --> 00:41:52.559
- Good looks...
- Kind heart.

00:41:53.039 --> 00:41:54.199
Yes, kind-hearted too.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.440
Do you still remember what you said

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.479
when you were courting me?

00:42:03.999 --> 00:42:05.639
Keep writing, hurry up.

00:42:05.639 --> 00:42:06.320
Go on, write.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.280
What are you doing? What's that?

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:08.880
I remember.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.530
What did you say?

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:10.639
Your parents are my parents.

00:42:10.639 --> 00:42:11.760
Your brother is my brother.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.639
Isn't your brother getting married soon?

00:42:17.479 --> 00:42:18.999
So your mom

00:42:20.639 --> 00:42:22.440
asked to borrow
a hundred thousand from me.

00:42:24.159 --> 00:42:24.999
And I lent it.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.440
Come on, read it.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.720
Selfless and fair.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.599
Thanks.

00:42:38.119 --> 00:42:39.400
Always asking for more.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.159
Louder.

00:42:40.159 --> 00:42:41.240
Always asking for more.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.039
Louder!

00:42:42.199 --> 00:42:43.880
Always asking for more.
