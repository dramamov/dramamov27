ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL MY QUEEN
BY XIE LOUNAN

00:01:35.985 --> 00:01:37.665
She must be Ling Cangcang.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.105
Huan always moves with a goal in mind.

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:42.385
So he is after her.

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:50.225
I've long admired Miss Ling,
your sect's leader,

00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:53.185
and always wished to meet her,

00:01:53.265 --> 00:01:56.145
but official duties kept me too busy.

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:00.385
Busy with official duties?
Aren't you known for being quite idle?

00:02:09.465 --> 00:02:10.785
You've actually met Miss Ling.

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.265
She was the one
who tattooed you last time.

00:02:22.145 --> 00:02:24.025
With your sect's leader and you

00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:25.985
both so brave and clever,

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:30.225
Mr. Bai here must be

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:31.665
no ordinary man either.

00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:32.705
Naturally.

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:35.625
Then why not have Mr. Bai

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:37.385
perform a sword dance

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:39.025
to enliven this gathering?

00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:49.265
Your Highness,

00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:51.385
I don't think that's necessary.

00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:53.305
We're swordsmen, not…

00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:54.825
Since Your Highness
wishes to be entertained,

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.585
I shall oblige.

00:04:16.624 --> 00:04:18.145
Has Mr. Bai lost his mind?

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:19.305
How dare he swing at His Highness?

00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:21.225
Does he have a death wish?

00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:24.345
Do they have some kind of grudge?

00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:26.305
His Highness is
Empress Dowager Liu's only son.

00:04:26.905 --> 00:04:29.105
Even the Emperor
treads lightly around him.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.345
Who would dare offend him?

00:04:34.705 --> 00:04:36.865
Then Bai must be a man of integrity

00:04:36.945 --> 00:04:37.945
who fears no authority.

00:05:05.425 --> 00:05:06.945
You came all the way to Southern Chu.

00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:10.625
You've made quite the effort to marry

00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:12.025
the Grand Tutor's daughter.

00:05:13.025 --> 00:05:15.545
I'm merely traveling incognito.

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:17.185
You're overreacting.

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:20.105
Traveling incognito?

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:22.625
And you just happened
to come to my territory

00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:23.665
and join Fenglai Pavilion?

00:05:24.265 --> 00:05:26.225
All under heaven belongs to the Emperor.

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:27.505
If you've done nothing wrong, Qianqing,

00:05:27.585 --> 00:05:29.385
why the unease?

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:31.745
Or have you just realized

00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:34.625
there's corruption festering

00:05:34.705 --> 00:05:35.705
in your domain?

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.985
Why is the cold poison flaring now?

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:02.305
Due to my clumsy swordsmanship,

00:06:02.385 --> 00:06:03.705
I damaged Your Highness's flowers.

00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:06.585
Please forgive me.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:15.985
Miss Zhong, Mr. Bai,

00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:17.945
goodbye.

00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:21.945
Your Highness,

00:06:22.025 --> 00:06:24.185
the mine incident was
the Lingbi Sect's doing.

00:06:24.265 --> 00:06:25.625
Please look into it.

00:06:26.465 --> 00:06:27.385
Rest assured, Miss Zhong.

00:06:27.465 --> 00:06:28.345
PRINCE OF YUZHANG'S MANOR

00:06:28.425 --> 00:06:29.465
I'll investigate

00:06:29.545 --> 00:06:31.985
this matter thoroughly.

00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:33.265
If there's any progress,

00:06:33.345 --> 00:06:34.745
Fenglai Pavilion will be
the first to know.

00:06:35.425 --> 00:06:36.985
Good. Thank you, Your Highness.

00:06:38.305 --> 00:06:40.825
If I manage to wipe out
the Lingbi Sect entirely,

00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:44.425
I wonder how you will thank me, Mr. Bai.

00:06:46.785 --> 00:06:48.345
Your Highness already rules over Chu

00:06:48.425 --> 00:06:49.825
and has everything one could desire.

00:06:49.905 --> 00:06:51.385
Surely there's nothing I can offer.

00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:54.665
What if I do have a request?

00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:09.025
What did he mean by that?

00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:35.145
You're awake?

00:07:44.345 --> 00:07:45.545
Where's Cangcang?

00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:47.305
She's safe and sound.

00:07:50.785 --> 00:07:53.065
The mine has been forced to shut down.

00:07:53.145 --> 00:07:55.425
The Lingbi Sect suffered heavy losses.

00:07:57.305 --> 00:07:59.865
The Grand Tutor is not pleased.

00:08:02.105 --> 00:08:03.465
I failed to live up to Father's trust.

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.905
Fortunately, the mine owner is dead.

00:08:06.905 --> 00:08:09.585
They won't be able
to trace anything useful.

00:08:09.665 --> 00:08:10.705
But that man

00:08:11.305 --> 00:08:12.825
won't give up so easily.

00:08:13.425 --> 00:08:14.465
If he…

00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:16.825
if he uses Cangcang…

00:08:18.225 --> 00:08:19.465
Focus on your recovery.

00:08:20.225 --> 00:08:22.105
I'll take care of the rest.

00:08:30.305 --> 00:08:33.545
PURE INTEGRITY

00:09:04.705 --> 00:09:05.865
Shi Yan,

00:09:06.465 --> 00:09:08.385
do you think slipping in
and out unseen is the only way

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.465
to live up to your title
as a Xiaoxing Guard?

00:09:14.665 --> 00:09:16.225
Your Majesty,
how did the cold poison flare up?

00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:18.865
Hasn't Preceptor Du's medicine
always kept it under control?

00:09:21.345 --> 00:09:22.225
Take this.

00:09:31.665 --> 00:09:32.825
The medicine's run out.

00:09:34.065 --> 00:09:35.265
You're out of medicine?

00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:36.385
Why didn't Li Hongqing
send someone back to fetch more?

00:09:36.985 --> 00:09:38.665
-How is he doing his job?
-It's not his fault.

00:09:39.185 --> 00:09:40.225
Things have been hectic.

00:09:40.865 --> 00:09:42.785
Have the miners been properly settled?

00:09:43.385 --> 00:09:44.585
Li Hongqing and I

00:09:44.665 --> 00:09:45.785
have already sent people
to escort them home.

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:48.305
But the number of miners we found

00:09:48.385 --> 00:09:49.305
doesn't match the number reported missing.

00:09:51.705 --> 00:09:54.705
Could some have died in the mine?

00:09:54.785 --> 00:09:56.305
We've counted all the bodies,

00:09:57.025 --> 00:09:58.065
but the total still falls short by many.

00:10:00.265 --> 00:10:02.345
Perhaps some escaped.

00:10:02.945 --> 00:10:04.185
No one's been found
returning home on their own.

00:10:06.425 --> 00:10:08.825
Then something else is going on here.

00:10:09.945 --> 00:10:11.225
I'll keep investigating.

00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:15.865
What about that masked young man
in the forest? Any leads?

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:18.545
I never saw him in my past contact
with the Lingbi Sect.

00:10:19.145 --> 00:10:21.225
Despite several attempts to investigate,

00:10:21.825 --> 00:10:23.145
I found no trace of him.

00:10:25.505 --> 00:10:28.225
It seems the Lingbi Sect
is still growing stronger.

00:10:29.745 --> 00:10:31.065
Shi Yan,

00:10:31.145 --> 00:10:33.945
I have a new mission for you.

00:10:35.545 --> 00:10:36.385
At your service.

00:10:37.385 --> 00:10:38.545
Strengthen Fenglai Pavilion.

00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:43.465
FENGLAI PAVILION

00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:48.465
Bai.

00:10:53.025 --> 00:10:53.985
You're up early.

00:10:54.065 --> 00:10:55.465
You just promoted me to hall master.

00:10:56.145 --> 00:10:57.585
Of course I should set an example

00:10:57.665 --> 00:10:58.825
for the other disciples.

00:10:58.905 --> 00:11:00.305
Looks like I didn't misjudge you.

00:11:00.385 --> 00:11:01.465
Really?

00:11:01.985 --> 00:11:04.665
Funny. As I recall, you used to keep me

00:11:04.745 --> 00:11:05.705
well outside the door.

00:11:07.065 --> 00:11:08.065
Did I?

00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:11.545
Well, life in the martial world
leaves one little room for trust.

00:11:12.065 --> 00:11:15.705
You can never be too cautious.

00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:32.265
Bai, I admit it.

00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:35.585
I once suspected you were my father's spy,

00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:37.265
so I was wary of you.

00:11:37.345 --> 00:11:39.585
Then I tricked you into posing
as the Prince of Yuzhang,

00:11:40.145 --> 00:11:41.345
and you were injured

00:11:42.345 --> 00:11:43.505
and even imprisoned.

00:11:44.105 --> 00:11:45.065
That was my fault.

00:11:52.785 --> 00:11:54.545
Bai Chifan, I apologize.

00:12:02.505 --> 00:12:04.025
Bai… no,

00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:06.185
Master Bai, Hall Master Bai,

00:12:06.265 --> 00:12:07.985
thank you for not abandoning me in danger

00:12:08.065 --> 00:12:10.065
and for sending people to
help Zhong Lin rescue those children.

00:12:10.665 --> 00:12:12.185
Bai, I swear,

00:12:12.265 --> 00:12:14.985
from now on, I'll see you
as my brother-in-arms at Fenglai Pavilion.

00:12:15.065 --> 00:12:16.985
I'll never deceive you or doubt you again.

00:12:18.665 --> 00:12:19.865
Hopeless.

00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:21.585
You still won't forgive me?

00:12:23.065 --> 00:12:25.145
You'd better find a new bookkeeper.

00:12:28.705 --> 00:12:30.465
Here, take a look.

00:12:31.825 --> 00:12:33.425
Since Fenglai Pavilion was founded
over a year ago,

00:12:33.505 --> 00:12:36.225
we've run a deficit of 3,800 liang.

00:12:37.785 --> 00:12:39.425
That's why you sighed?

00:12:40.785 --> 00:12:41.865
Of course.

00:12:42.545 --> 00:12:43.705
That's no big deal.

00:12:43.785 --> 00:12:45.825
I'll just steal
a few of my father's paintings or antiques

00:12:45.905 --> 00:12:47.145
and make up the loss. There are plenty.

00:12:48.865 --> 00:12:50.825
That's not a long-term solution.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.225
Relax, Bai.

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:55.545
Fenglai Pavilion isn't short on money.

00:12:55.625 --> 00:12:56.785
Besides,

00:12:57.705 --> 00:12:59.105
we've got you, haven't we?

00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:07.945
Miss Ling!

00:13:09.265 --> 00:13:11.185
Miss Ling,
a big crowd has gathered outside.

00:13:11.265 --> 00:13:12.985
They all want to join Fenglai Pavilion!

00:13:13.065 --> 00:13:14.105
What?

00:13:19.505 --> 00:13:21.425
FENGLAI PAVILION

00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:31.345
What were you two talking about just now?

00:13:31.865 --> 00:13:33.065
Nothing much.

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.545
Nothing much?

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:36.105
I doubt that.

00:13:36.985 --> 00:13:38.945
You used to be so wary of him,

00:13:39.545 --> 00:13:40.785
but now look at you,

00:13:40.865 --> 00:13:44.105
making him a hall master
and calling his name nonstop.

00:13:45.705 --> 00:13:47.025
Cangcang,

00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:49.145
what exactly happened between you two?

00:13:50.265 --> 00:13:51.465
I'll do all I can

00:13:51.545 --> 00:13:52.705
so you won't have to act alone.

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.225
Really, nothing happened.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:59.265
He saved my life.

00:13:59.345 --> 00:14:00.625
Then we spent
one night together in prison.

00:14:01.665 --> 00:14:02.905
One night?

00:14:04.145 --> 00:14:05.105
And you call that nothing?

00:14:05.705 --> 00:14:07.985
Don't tell me you plan
to repay him with your heart.

00:14:08.065 --> 00:14:09.345
What are you…?

00:14:14.265 --> 00:14:16.385
-Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
-You…

00:14:24.105 --> 00:14:26.825
Don't you think he's

00:14:27.665 --> 00:14:29.385
dashing,

00:14:29.465 --> 00:14:30.625
charming,

00:14:31.345 --> 00:14:33.345
and easy on the eye?

00:14:33.425 --> 00:14:34.545
Not one bit.

00:14:35.905 --> 00:14:36.985
I think he's

00:14:37.905 --> 00:14:38.945
all appearance

00:14:39.025 --> 00:14:40.265
and no substance. Absolutely repulsive.

00:14:43.025 --> 00:14:44.985
Why do I feel

00:14:45.945 --> 00:14:48.585
like his every move

00:14:49.145 --> 00:14:50.505
carries a kind of…

00:14:50.585 --> 00:14:54.065
A kind of duplicitous danger?

00:14:55.265 --> 00:14:58.425
A kind of fatal charm.

00:14:58.505 --> 00:14:59.865
You're hopeless!

00:15:15.025 --> 00:15:16.465
My name is Shi Yan.
I specialize in the blade,

00:15:17.145 --> 00:15:19.105
especially the 72 Kunlun Swift Strikes.

00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:20.425
Cangcang, that man

00:15:20.505 --> 00:15:23.025
is the one who helped us
rescue the children last time.

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:28.065
That's right. Greetings, Miss Ling.

00:15:28.665 --> 00:15:30.305
Very well. You're in.

00:15:32.625 --> 00:15:33.625
Miss Ling,

00:15:33.705 --> 00:15:35.425
shouldn't you think it over?

00:15:36.065 --> 00:15:37.105
What's to think about?

00:15:37.185 --> 00:15:38.985
He's Bai's man. I trust him.

00:15:48.825 --> 00:15:50.385
Master, I led Fenglai Pavilion

00:15:50.465 --> 00:15:52.305
to strike a heavy blow against
that inhumane Refinement Quarry.

00:15:52.905 --> 00:15:55.745
We rescued all the children
who'd been taken there by force.

00:15:56.625 --> 00:15:59.065
I know you mean to rid the world of evil,

00:15:59.665 --> 00:16:00.825
but do you understand

00:16:00.905 --> 00:16:03.825
how tangled the powers
behind that mine are?

00:16:03.905 --> 00:16:04.905
Of course.

00:16:04.985 --> 00:16:06.625
They're all people from the Lingbi Sect.

00:16:06.705 --> 00:16:07.545
I even saw

00:16:09.265 --> 00:16:10.265
the Ghost King himself.

00:16:17.705 --> 00:16:18.945
What is it, Master?

00:16:22.465 --> 00:16:23.985
The Ghost King is dangerous.

00:16:24.665 --> 00:16:25.505
Yes,

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:27.705
he's committed countless atrocities
and harmed so many people.

00:16:28.745 --> 00:16:30.065
And guess what?

00:16:30.145 --> 00:16:31.585
They didn't take those children

00:16:31.665 --> 00:16:33.425
just to work as slaves.

00:16:34.145 --> 00:16:36.505
They were turning
them into stone-like creatures.

00:16:37.385 --> 00:16:39.945
There must be a greater plot behind it.

00:16:42.105 --> 00:16:44.465
I hear Bai never leaves your side.

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:45.865
His ambitions may

00:16:45.945 --> 00:16:47.905
well match the Ghost King's.

00:16:49.665 --> 00:16:51.265
Did Zhong Lin say something to you?

00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:53.105
I've looked into him.

00:16:53.185 --> 00:16:54.865
His identity is false.

00:16:58.105 --> 00:16:59.145
I knew that already.

00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:06.704
And you still trust him?

00:17:09.785 --> 00:17:12.585
Everyone has their own burdens
and secrets.

00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:13.825
Just because he hasn't told me the truth

00:17:13.905 --> 00:17:15.345
doesn't mean he never will.

00:17:15.905 --> 00:17:16.785
I can wait.

00:17:17.505 --> 00:17:18.585
Besides,

00:17:19.105 --> 00:17:21.985
I've kept my own identity from him too.

00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:26.944
The human heart is unpredictable.

00:17:27.905 --> 00:17:29.825
He's worked hard to get close to you.

00:17:30.505 --> 00:17:31.505
He must have his own agenda.

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:35.905
Perhaps
it has to do with your other identity.

00:17:39.905 --> 00:17:41.305
Time reveals all.

00:17:41.905 --> 00:17:44.345
Whether he cares for me as
the Sect Leader of Fenglai Pavilion

00:17:44.425 --> 00:17:46.305
or as the Grand Tutor's daughter,

00:17:46.385 --> 00:17:48.865
I'll find out one day.

00:17:50.785 --> 00:17:51.785
Cangcang,

00:17:52.305 --> 00:17:54.785
I know you've always been kind

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:57.145
and unwilling to see
the world through suspicion.

00:17:57.745 --> 00:18:00.265
But remember, the only person

00:18:00.785 --> 00:18:03.905
who loves you without reservation
is your father.

00:18:04.505 --> 00:18:07.065
Even I, your master,
am not worthy of your full trust.

00:18:09.025 --> 00:18:10.145
How could you say that?

00:18:10.225 --> 00:18:11.785
If you hadn't saved me back then,

00:18:11.865 --> 00:18:14.665
I would've been taken away and killed.

00:18:14.745 --> 00:18:15.785
You saved my life.

00:18:15.865 --> 00:18:16.905
If I can't trust you, who can I trust?

00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:19.465
Enough, Cangcang.

00:18:20.465 --> 00:18:22.785
Your father entrusted you to me,

00:18:22.865 --> 00:18:23.785
so I must keep you safe.

00:18:25.585 --> 00:18:26.785
Promise me

00:18:26.865 --> 00:18:29.345
you'll keep your distance from Bai,
all right?

00:18:34.345 --> 00:18:36.665
Now rest. I'll take my leave.

00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:43.065
Master…

00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:51.105
I received word from
the Prince of Yuzhang's Manor

00:18:51.185 --> 00:18:52.225
that His Highness released the Emperor

00:18:53.105 --> 00:18:54.385
and started investigating the Lingbi Sect.

00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:56.985
Sometimes,

00:18:57.065 --> 00:18:59.465
I truly wonder what goes on

00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:01.065
in my own son's head.

00:19:01.145 --> 00:19:03.025
Please calm down, Your Majesty.
Anger will only harm your health.

00:19:03.945 --> 00:19:06.265
How did I give birth
to such a stubborn child?

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.465
Instead of seizing
the opportunity to deal with Xiao…

00:19:11.305 --> 00:19:13.145
he had to provoke the Lingbi Sect.

00:19:13.225 --> 00:19:15.545
Does he know how powerful they are
in the martial world?

00:19:16.145 --> 00:19:17.545
What a troublemaker.

00:19:18.065 --> 00:19:21.225
-What should we do with the Emperor?
-At this point,

00:19:22.025 --> 00:19:23.465
we'll have to take
matters into our own hands.

00:19:29.665 --> 00:19:30.865
Bai.

00:19:30.945 --> 00:19:32.225
FENGLAI PAVILION

00:19:34.025 --> 00:19:35.305
Miss Ling, we've taken in

00:19:35.385 --> 00:19:37.065
73 disciples over the past few days.

00:19:37.145 --> 00:19:38.025
I've written down

00:19:38.105 --> 00:19:40.705
all their details here for you to review.

00:19:41.585 --> 00:19:44.745
Good. Bai, thanks for your hard work.

00:19:44.825 --> 00:19:45.745
It's nothing.

00:19:45.825 --> 00:19:47.625
Earning your trust is what matters.

00:19:47.705 --> 00:19:49.865
I just got my hands
on two fine jars of wine.

00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:51.105
It's the Lantern Festival.

00:19:51.185 --> 00:19:52.465
Let's celebrate.

00:19:52.545 --> 00:19:53.385
Celebrate?

00:19:56.185 --> 00:19:58.025
FENGLAI PAVILION

00:20:02.145 --> 00:20:03.105
Here.

00:20:09.505 --> 00:20:11.265
You're in quite the festive mood today.

00:20:11.865 --> 00:20:14.945
Good wine should always
be shared with good friends.

00:20:15.025 --> 00:20:15.865
Cheers.

00:20:18.745 --> 00:20:19.785
Go on and try it.

00:20:24.185 --> 00:20:25.065
Excellent wine.

00:20:27.065 --> 00:20:28.985
Does it remind you of your hometown?

00:20:31.065 --> 00:20:32.985
It's called Sangluo Wine.

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.585
"There we sit, sharing Sangluo Wine

00:20:34.665 --> 00:20:36.065
and playing with chrysanthemum branches."

00:20:37.065 --> 00:20:40.505
It's brewed by the Bai clan of Xiling.
Do you recognize it?

00:20:43.905 --> 00:20:46.745
I suppose you've figured out

00:20:46.825 --> 00:20:48.945
that I'm not from the Bai clan of Xiling,

00:20:49.985 --> 00:20:53.145
yet you still treat me as a close friend.

00:20:53.225 --> 00:20:54.945
As close friends,

00:20:55.025 --> 00:20:56.825
we should be straightforward
with each other

00:20:56.905 --> 00:20:57.745
rather than play tricks.

00:20:57.825 --> 00:20:59.185
Very well.

00:20:59.265 --> 00:21:00.825
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:03.225
I do

00:21:03.785 --> 00:21:05.185
see you as a close friend.

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:09.585
But I still think you haven't
been entirely honest with me.

00:21:10.985 --> 00:21:14.025
For instance, I still don't know
who you really are.

00:21:14.825 --> 00:21:15.785
What about you, Miss Ling?

00:21:16.625 --> 00:21:19.705
Will you tell me your true identity?

00:21:20.745 --> 00:21:22.545
That's not the same.

00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:24.465
I have secrets I cannot speak of.

00:21:25.065 --> 00:21:26.625
How do you know

00:21:26.705 --> 00:21:28.185
I have no secrets I must keep?

00:21:30.145 --> 00:21:31.145
I…

00:21:43.305 --> 00:21:45.505
Since we both carry secrets
we cannot share,

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:50.305
we are not so different after all.

00:22:16.545 --> 00:22:17.625
Someone told me

00:22:18.465 --> 00:22:20.705
you got close to me with a plan.

00:22:21.385 --> 00:22:22.825
Or perhaps…

00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:26.225
Perhaps what?

00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:30.145
Nothing.

00:22:34.345 --> 00:22:37.505
Who said I meant you harm?

00:22:39.265 --> 00:22:40.785
Someone I trust.

00:22:41.385 --> 00:22:43.745
Have I ever harmed Fenglai Pavilion?

00:22:46.705 --> 00:22:48.065
Have I ever hurt you?

00:22:58.785 --> 00:22:59.745
Then I suppose

00:23:00.265 --> 00:23:02.425
my master is suspicious of you

00:23:02.505 --> 00:23:04.345
because he doesn't know you well enough.

00:23:06.705 --> 00:23:07.945
So it was your master.

00:23:09.265 --> 00:23:10.745
As distance tests a horse's strength,

00:23:10.825 --> 00:23:12.065
time reveals a person's heart.

00:23:13.145 --> 00:23:15.025
You need not trust me now.

00:23:15.745 --> 00:23:16.985
Just…

00:23:28.625 --> 00:23:29.505
Bold fools,

00:23:29.585 --> 00:23:31.105
how dare you break into Fenglai Pavilion?

00:23:31.185 --> 00:23:32.625
You go first. I'll handle them.

00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:34.265
We'll fight together.

00:24:28.825 --> 00:24:29.865
Look out!

00:24:40.185 --> 00:24:41.265
Assassins!

00:24:50.385 --> 00:24:51.265
Bai, are you all right?

00:24:52.585 --> 00:24:54.625
-Let's go.
-Seize them!

00:24:56.505 --> 00:24:57.385
Be careful.

00:25:05.865 --> 00:25:06.825
Bai.

00:25:07.545 --> 00:25:08.385
Bai?

00:25:08.905 --> 00:25:09.865
Bai?

00:25:12.225 --> 00:25:13.265
Somebody!

00:25:13.945 --> 00:25:15.545
Hurry! Get a physician!

00:25:18.065 --> 00:25:18.945
Go after them!

00:25:21.625 --> 00:25:22.665
Stop him!

00:25:32.785 --> 00:25:34.745
It was a suicide mission.
They all had poison in their mouths.

00:25:53.025 --> 00:25:54.865
Sir, how is he?

00:25:58.945 --> 00:26:01.825
I've never seen
such a complicated pulse before.

00:26:01.905 --> 00:26:02.985
What do you mean?

00:26:03.065 --> 00:26:04.585
The poison has invaded
his internal organs.

00:26:04.665 --> 00:26:06.065
He won't live long.

00:26:06.145 --> 00:26:07.585
Now that he's lost so much blood,

00:26:07.665 --> 00:26:09.105
his pulse should be weak.

00:26:09.185 --> 00:26:10.385
-But…
-But what?

00:26:10.465 --> 00:26:13.825
But his pulse is still strong and steady.

00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:15.665
Then why hasn't he woken up?

00:26:16.265 --> 00:26:18.665
That's what baffles me.

00:26:18.745 --> 00:26:19.825
You said the poison had

00:26:20.665 --> 00:26:21.745
reached his internal organs.
What does that mean?

00:26:22.345 --> 00:26:23.825
Judging by his pulse,

00:26:23.905 --> 00:26:25.145
he's suffering from cold poison.

00:26:25.225 --> 00:26:28.345
It must have been
in his body for over ten years.

00:26:28.425 --> 00:26:29.545
Impossible.

00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:31.225
He seemed perfectly fine,

00:26:31.305 --> 00:26:32.825
and his martial skills are extraordinary.

00:26:32.905 --> 00:26:33.745
How could that be?

00:26:34.345 --> 00:26:35.385
Then it makes sense.

00:26:35.465 --> 00:26:37.505
His martial arts training has allowed him

00:26:37.585 --> 00:26:39.665
to keep the poison
in check with inner force.

00:26:39.745 --> 00:26:43.185
That's why his pulse
remains strong despite the blood loss.

00:26:43.265 --> 00:26:45.305
He must have been taking
an antidote regularly.

00:26:46.745 --> 00:26:47.825
Antidote?

00:26:48.585 --> 00:26:49.625
What is this?

00:26:52.225 --> 00:26:53.345
A life-saving medicine.

00:26:59.065 --> 00:27:01.465
He gave me his last pill.

00:27:01.545 --> 00:27:03.865
Then you must find him
another one at once.

00:27:03.945 --> 00:27:05.345
Shi Yan must know about the antidote.

00:27:06.305 --> 00:27:08.065
-Hurry. Get Shi Yan here.
-Got it.

00:27:08.145 --> 00:27:09.105
Shi Yan!

00:27:10.825 --> 00:27:12.665
-Do you have Hall Master Bai's antidote?
-What happened to him?

00:27:12.745 --> 00:27:13.705
He fainted.

00:27:13.785 --> 00:27:14.905
The physician said he needed the antidote.

00:27:14.985 --> 00:27:16.305
I'll be right back.

00:27:26.145 --> 00:27:28.145
Bai, you fool.

00:27:28.905 --> 00:27:31.225
That antidote was meant
to save your own life,

00:27:32.745 --> 00:27:33.945
yet you gave it to me.

00:27:35.265 --> 00:27:37.785
You risked your life for me
again and again,

00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:40.025
yet I still doubted you.

00:27:42.385 --> 00:27:43.985
Master only grew suspicious of you

00:27:44.665 --> 00:27:46.705
because he didn't know you.

00:27:47.225 --> 00:27:49.665
But deep down,
I'd already come to trust you.

00:27:49.745 --> 00:27:51.465
I shouldn't have tested you.

00:27:53.265 --> 00:27:54.585
It was my fault.

00:27:54.665 --> 00:27:56.385
You haven't even heard my apology yet,

00:27:57.385 --> 00:27:59.305
so you can't die.

00:28:03.025 --> 00:28:05.225
Please, wake up soon.

00:28:19.905 --> 00:28:22.945
Please, wake up soon.

00:28:33.465 --> 00:28:34.385
Cangcang,

00:28:35.305 --> 00:28:36.545
what's wrong?

00:28:37.745 --> 00:28:38.825
Bai,

00:28:41.425 --> 00:28:42.625
you're really awake.

00:28:44.905 --> 00:28:45.905
You've been crying?

00:28:46.705 --> 00:28:48.145
I…

00:28:48.745 --> 00:28:49.705
I haven't.

00:28:50.465 --> 00:28:52.425
I was just a little scared.

00:28:57.785 --> 00:28:58.625
Don't worry.

00:28:59.305 --> 00:29:00.465
It'll take more than this to kill me.

00:29:05.105 --> 00:29:06.305
I had a dream.

00:29:06.865 --> 00:29:08.185
In it, I was wandering near death's door.

00:29:09.145 --> 00:29:10.705
Then suddenly, someone called my name.

00:29:10.785 --> 00:29:12.225
When I turned around,

00:29:12.745 --> 00:29:13.865
I saw that it was you,
crying your eyes out.

00:29:14.625 --> 00:29:16.105
I couldn't help but laugh.

00:29:16.185 --> 00:29:18.665
Then I woke up.

00:29:19.385 --> 00:29:22.025
You're making fun of me
at a time like this?

00:29:26.865 --> 00:29:29.145
Did I hurt you?

00:29:29.225 --> 00:29:30.145
I'm fine.

00:29:30.665 --> 00:29:32.465
You were worried about me?

00:29:32.545 --> 00:29:33.465
Of course.

00:29:33.985 --> 00:29:35.665
When I got sick as a child,

00:29:35.745 --> 00:29:37.945
my father would stay up all night
by my bedside too.

00:29:39.785 --> 00:29:42.105
Are you close to your father?

00:29:47.025 --> 00:29:50.025
My mother passed away
when I was very young.

00:29:52.105 --> 00:29:54.145
Father raised me on his own.

00:29:56.585 --> 00:29:58.585
Then how could he allow you

00:29:58.665 --> 00:30:00.185
to wander the martial world alone?

00:30:01.145 --> 00:30:02.665
Because I have my master.

00:30:05.465 --> 00:30:08.065
No wonder your master's words
carry such weight.

00:30:12.585 --> 00:30:13.585
Bai,

00:30:14.385 --> 00:30:18.105
my master only doubts you

00:30:18.185 --> 00:30:20.305
because he doesn't know you.

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:21.305
Don't worry.

00:30:21.385 --> 00:30:23.025
I'll make sure

00:30:23.105 --> 00:30:24.945
he trusts you

00:30:25.025 --> 00:30:27.145
as much as I do, all right?

00:30:31.665 --> 00:30:33.945
Now, get some more rest.

00:30:34.025 --> 00:30:36.425
I'll go check on the antidote.

00:30:37.665 --> 00:30:38.985
Wait.

00:31:14.425 --> 00:31:15.305
Did you get the antidote?

00:31:15.385 --> 00:31:17.145
The Imperial Preceptor just made it.
Why the rush?

00:31:17.225 --> 00:31:18.185
His Majesty's cold poison has flared up.

00:31:18.265 --> 00:31:19.105
How could that happen?

00:31:19.185 --> 00:31:20.505
It's complicated. Let's head back first.

00:31:43.585 --> 00:31:45.665
You're in this condition
and still planning to go out?

00:31:46.265 --> 00:31:47.465
I'm going to take Cangcang away.

00:31:47.545 --> 00:31:48.545
In your state,

00:31:49.145 --> 00:31:51.025
even if you see her, what can you do?

00:31:51.625 --> 00:31:53.625
Cangcang is naive and easily deceived.

00:31:54.305 --> 00:31:55.265
I'm taking her back to the Capital.

00:31:55.345 --> 00:31:57.865
Whether by deceit or by force,

00:31:58.385 --> 00:31:59.225
I'm taking her back.

00:32:02.305 --> 00:32:05.345
The Lingbi Sect's affair
is what matters most right now.

00:32:05.425 --> 00:32:07.545
If they really uncover something,

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:09.105
how should we answer to the master?

00:32:10.585 --> 00:32:11.945
Father ordered me to protect Cangcang.

00:32:12.745 --> 00:32:13.905
If anything happens to her,

00:32:14.905 --> 00:32:15.945
how will I face him?

00:32:19.265 --> 00:32:21.225
Are you doing this
for your adoptive father's sake

00:32:21.825 --> 00:32:23.625
or for your own?

00:32:23.705 --> 00:32:25.545
You know the answer better than I do.

00:32:36.025 --> 00:32:38.705
So Your Majesty
gave the antidote to Miss Ling.

00:32:39.825 --> 00:32:41.305
I failed to notice

00:32:41.385 --> 00:32:43.385
Your Majesty's relapse earlier.
I deserve punishment.

00:32:43.465 --> 00:32:46.505
I've had this cold poison since birth.

00:32:46.585 --> 00:32:48.425
After all these years, I'm used to it.

00:32:49.265 --> 00:32:51.145
Have you traced the assassins?

00:32:51.225 --> 00:32:52.905
I let one escape on purpose

00:32:52.985 --> 00:32:54.505
and sent the Xiaoxing Guards after him.

00:32:54.585 --> 00:32:55.665
He eventually turned up

00:32:56.265 --> 00:32:57.385
at the Prince of Yuzhang's Manor.

00:32:59.105 --> 00:33:00.745
The Prince of Yuzhang's Manor?

00:33:04.265 --> 00:33:05.345
Your Majesty,

00:33:05.425 --> 00:33:07.185
we may have found a clue
about the murder thralls at the mine.

00:33:13.385 --> 00:33:14.665
What is it?

00:33:15.585 --> 00:33:16.865
The Botang Pleasure Boat.

00:33:17.825 --> 00:33:20.105
-The Botang Pleasure Boat?
-The Botang Pleasure Boat

00:33:20.185 --> 00:33:22.385
is not that well-known,
but I've heard of it.

00:33:23.105 --> 00:33:24.745
Despite its name,
it offers no pleasure of that sort.

00:33:24.825 --> 00:33:27.065
Rare and valuable items are
auctioned there. It's highly exclusive.

00:33:27.945 --> 00:33:30.785
It's said that one must have

00:33:30.865 --> 00:33:32.545
a special invitation to board.

00:33:35.625 --> 00:33:37.065
Zhong Lin can handle that.

00:33:37.985 --> 00:33:39.105
I want to see it for myself.

00:33:39.985 --> 00:33:41.665
PRINCE OF YUZHANG'S MANOR

00:33:41.745 --> 00:33:42.705
You still haven't

00:33:42.785 --> 00:33:44.385
found the Ghost King?

00:33:45.065 --> 00:33:47.345
What have you all been doing?

00:33:48.025 --> 00:33:49.025
At this rate,

00:33:49.105 --> 00:33:51.105
when will you catch him

00:33:51.185 --> 00:33:52.385
and root out the Lingbi Sect?

00:33:53.265 --> 00:33:54.945
Make the Ghost King
show himself in three days,

00:33:55.585 --> 00:33:58.505
-or bring me your heads!
-Understood!

00:34:02.345 --> 00:34:04.825
Your Highness,
Bai Chifan from Fenglai Pavilion

00:34:04.905 --> 00:34:06.225
just sent word.

00:34:06.865 --> 00:34:08.025
What is it?

00:34:09.425 --> 00:34:11.665
Three words: Botang Pleasure Boat.

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:49.344
Why does he

00:34:50.264 --> 00:34:51.545
look different today?

00:34:52.145 --> 00:34:53.105
Was he always like this?

00:35:05.385 --> 00:35:06.585
Good morning, Miss Ling.

00:35:10.105 --> 00:35:11.145
Good morning.

00:35:12.985 --> 00:35:14.425
Are you feeling better?

00:35:15.105 --> 00:35:15.985
Much better.

00:35:16.065 --> 00:35:17.865
Thank you
for taking care of me last night.

00:35:21.025 --> 00:35:23.665
After all, you were hurt because of me.

00:35:23.745 --> 00:35:27.305
It's only right that I look after you.

00:35:28.145 --> 00:35:30.305
Why do you seem different today?

00:35:30.905 --> 00:35:31.865
So uneasy.

00:35:32.665 --> 00:35:33.545
Do I?

00:35:37.025 --> 00:35:38.985
-Is it because of last night…?
-No!

00:35:40.145 --> 00:35:41.185
What?

00:35:42.785 --> 00:35:43.985
I…

00:35:46.905 --> 00:35:48.105
I…

00:35:49.345 --> 00:35:51.265
I feel a little dizzy.

00:35:53.265 --> 00:35:56.025
Maybe I'm coming down with something.

00:35:59.265 --> 00:36:00.585
I should go.

00:36:16.225 --> 00:36:17.705
Your pulse is racing.

00:36:17.785 --> 00:36:19.265
That's not quite normal.

00:36:20.865 --> 00:36:23.505
But your complexion doesn't look like
that of someone ill.

00:36:24.145 --> 00:36:25.305
Is something bothering you?

00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:29.225
How about I take you out

00:36:30.025 --> 00:36:31.265
for some fresh air?

00:36:42.705 --> 00:36:44.225
Hurry, honey.

00:36:44.305 --> 00:36:46.065
I heard the boat had a Harmony Chamber,

00:36:46.145 --> 00:36:47.025
and only couples are allowed inside.

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:50.145
A trip on this boat
without a fair lady for company

00:36:50.225 --> 00:36:52.185
-would be a waste indeed.
-It'll be a sleepless night.

00:36:52.265 --> 00:36:53.665
A night of romance…

00:36:53.745 --> 00:36:54.665
-Wait.
-…is what makes the trip worthwhile.

00:36:55.545 --> 00:36:57.305
Why did you bring me here
dressed like this?

00:36:58.025 --> 00:36:59.825
Look around.

00:36:59.905 --> 00:37:02.225
Isn't it obvious what we're here for?

00:37:04.665 --> 00:37:05.665
Then I'm not going.

00:37:06.185 --> 00:37:07.225
You can't back out now.

00:37:08.105 --> 00:37:09.785
Everything's ready. Only you're missing.

00:37:09.865 --> 00:37:10.865
What?

00:37:10.945 --> 00:37:13.345
Yes, I've roamed the martial world
and care little for rules,

00:37:13.425 --> 00:37:14.625
but I'm not that kind of girl.

00:37:15.505 --> 00:37:18.105
What does that have to do
with rescuing missing youths?

00:37:19.465 --> 00:37:20.385
What missing youths?

00:37:21.665 --> 00:37:23.505
The number of rescued miners didn't match
the missing count.

00:37:23.585 --> 00:37:26.065
I suspect many were sold here.

00:37:26.665 --> 00:37:28.465
That's why I invited you along.

00:37:29.505 --> 00:37:30.585
Anything wrong with that?

00:37:36.105 --> 00:37:37.225
Nothing.

00:37:38.545 --> 00:37:39.385
Let's go, then.

00:37:46.745 --> 00:37:48.585
You two look unfamiliar.

00:37:48.665 --> 00:37:50.305
First time aboard?

00:37:52.865 --> 00:37:54.105
A green haitang blossom?

00:37:55.185 --> 00:37:56.545
Distinguished guests indeed.

00:37:56.625 --> 00:37:58.625
Sir and madam, this way, please.

00:37:58.705 --> 00:38:00.505
Sir and madam?

00:38:03.025 --> 00:38:05.425
After you, honey.

00:38:13.065 --> 00:38:15.025
The boat is setting sail!

00:38:15.665 --> 00:38:17.385
Setting sail? Why?

00:38:18.145 --> 00:38:19.345
You truly are newcomers.

00:38:19.425 --> 00:38:21.585
The boat sails to open waters

00:38:21.665 --> 00:38:22.585
before trading begins.

00:38:25.945 --> 00:38:27.505
Once it's out at sea,

00:38:27.585 --> 00:38:29.265
Shi Yan's men on shore

00:38:29.345 --> 00:38:30.945
will be of no use.

00:38:31.025 --> 00:38:33.105
Sir and madam, come.

00:38:41.505 --> 00:38:43.625
-Look at his fan.
-I know.

00:38:44.225 --> 00:38:46.425
-Isn't that…?
-He looks

00:38:47.065 --> 00:38:48.665
so dignified.

00:38:48.745 --> 00:38:49.945
Who would've thought?

00:38:50.025 --> 00:38:50.945
What a pity.

00:38:51.625 --> 00:38:52.985
-Who would've thought?
-Exactly.

00:38:53.065 --> 00:38:53.945
Let's go.

00:38:54.625 --> 00:38:56.705
-Did you see that?
-A green haitang blossom!

00:38:56.785 --> 00:38:57.625
Did you see it?

00:38:57.705 --> 00:38:59.905
-Yes, I saw it.
-What do the different colors

00:38:59.985 --> 00:39:01.865
-even mean?
-I have no idea.

00:39:01.945 --> 00:39:03.185
Everyone's staring at us.

00:39:03.265 --> 00:39:06.105
Zhong Lin said she saw an invitation
with a green haitang blossom,

00:39:06.185 --> 00:39:07.425
so she made one just like it.

00:39:07.985 --> 00:39:09.985
Maybe we should slip away while we can.

00:39:12.145 --> 00:39:13.585
Come, honey.

00:39:13.665 --> 00:39:14.785
I'm not your honey.

00:39:16.185 --> 00:39:17.625
If we're acting,
we should make it convincing.

00:39:18.185 --> 00:39:20.225
Don't forget why we're here, honey.

00:39:20.785 --> 00:39:21.945
Sir and madam,

00:39:22.465 --> 00:39:23.785
this way, please.

00:39:25.745 --> 00:39:26.705
Let's go, honey.

00:39:39.705 --> 00:39:40.585
Please come in.

00:39:45.985 --> 00:39:47.345
Come on, honey.

00:39:47.425 --> 00:39:48.265
Sit.

00:39:51.065 --> 00:39:52.745
Playing the loving couple
in the Green Haitang Chamber?

00:39:52.825 --> 00:39:53.785
Aren't you tired?

00:39:53.865 --> 00:39:54.705
Xiaoyang, mind your tongue.

00:39:54.785 --> 00:39:57.265
They're guests. Serve them tea.

00:40:00.105 --> 00:40:01.425
What would you like?

00:40:02.225 --> 00:40:04.225
That depends on what you have to offer.

00:40:04.305 --> 00:40:05.945
Tiger, snake,
and lion parts, dragon pills,

00:40:06.025 --> 00:40:07.985
invincibility pills,
prepared salt, and stink bugs.

00:40:08.065 --> 00:40:09.585
As long as you can pay,

00:40:09.665 --> 00:40:11.745
we have whatever you desire.

00:40:11.825 --> 00:40:13.745
And how brave you are, sir.

00:40:13.825 --> 00:40:16.705
We rarely see male guests
in the Green Haitang Chamber.

00:40:18.585 --> 00:40:20.745
-Did you see that?
-A green haitang blossom!

00:40:20.825 --> 00:40:23.185
-Did you see that?
-He looks dashing.

00:40:23.265 --> 00:40:24.585
-Who would've thought?
-Exactly.

00:40:34.745 --> 00:40:36.385
Such a shame.

00:40:42.945 --> 00:40:45.305
You don't understand what's going on.

00:40:45.385 --> 00:40:47.185
Keep quiet. Let me handle this.

00:40:51.705 --> 00:40:53.305
Now, that's not very nice to say.

00:40:53.905 --> 00:40:56.025
My husband and I share true affection.

00:40:56.105 --> 00:40:58.665
I won't despise him
just because he's frail.

00:40:58.745 --> 00:41:01.505
No matter what happens to him,

00:41:02.985 --> 00:41:05.265
-I'll love him all the same.
-How touching.

00:41:05.345 --> 00:41:07.145
For such devotion,

00:41:07.225 --> 00:41:09.665
I'll give you a discount.

00:41:09.745 --> 00:41:11.225
Here's the thing, madam.

00:41:11.305 --> 00:41:12.265
Ordinary medicine

00:41:12.345 --> 00:41:13.545
doesn't work

00:41:14.145 --> 00:41:16.785
on my husband.

00:41:16.865 --> 00:41:18.745
Then what are you saying, madam?

00:41:19.945 --> 00:41:21.225
I mean,

00:41:21.305 --> 00:41:22.985
on a grand pleasure boat like this,

00:41:23.065 --> 00:41:26.185
surely there are other chambers
that can help him.

00:41:26.265 --> 00:41:28.465
The red, yellow, and blue
haitang chambers.

00:41:28.545 --> 00:41:29.745
What are they all for?

00:41:29.825 --> 00:41:32.985
Besides medicine, what else can we try?

00:41:33.065 --> 00:41:34.905
Do you look down on my chamber?

00:41:34.985 --> 00:41:36.465
Not at all.

00:41:36.545 --> 00:41:38.465
I don't doubt
the quality of your goods, madam.

00:41:38.545 --> 00:41:39.705
It's…

00:41:40.825 --> 00:41:43.305
it's my husband's body I don't trust.

00:41:45.185 --> 00:41:46.745
Say something, my love.

00:41:46.825 --> 00:41:48.945
All these years, has any medicine

00:41:49.505 --> 00:41:50.545
worked for you?

00:41:52.825 --> 00:41:53.825
Well,

00:41:54.425 --> 00:41:55.905
none so far.

00:41:58.785 --> 00:42:00.705
Madam, you heard him.

00:42:00.785 --> 00:42:02.025
Please, help us.

00:42:02.105 --> 00:42:03.945
Let us enter the other types of chambers.

00:42:13.225 --> 00:42:15.265
Sir and madam, please leave.

00:42:15.345 --> 00:42:16.185
Go that way.

00:42:16.265 --> 00:42:17.785
A boat will take you ashore.

00:42:18.825 --> 00:42:20.465
Don't you claim to fulfill
every wish here?

00:42:20.545 --> 00:42:22.905
Why drive us out simply for not buying
your medicine?

00:42:22.985 --> 00:42:25.105
That's how
the Botang Pleasure Boat operates.

00:42:25.185 --> 00:42:26.185
If you refuse to leave,

00:42:26.265 --> 00:42:28.025
you'll be thrown overboard
to feed the fish.

00:42:28.105 --> 00:42:30.185
Don't make this hard.

00:42:30.705 --> 00:42:32.985
If we're thrown out now,
this trip will be for nothing.

00:42:33.065 --> 00:42:33.905
I know.

00:42:33.985 --> 00:42:35.185
As Sect Leader of Fenglai Pavilion,

00:42:35.265 --> 00:42:36.185
I won't take this lying down.

00:42:36.265 --> 00:42:37.345
Go.

00:42:37.425 --> 00:42:38.385
Wait.

00:42:39.945 --> 00:42:40.825
Those

00:42:41.705 --> 00:42:44.505
animal parts, dragon pills, and whatnot.

00:42:45.145 --> 00:42:45.985
We'll buy them.

00:42:48.705 --> 00:42:49.625
My love,

00:42:50.585 --> 00:42:52.745
get… get the money.

00:42:57.665 --> 00:43:00.625
In that case, sir and madam,
please follow me.

00:43:15.185 --> 00:43:16.425
Sir and madam,

00:43:16.505 --> 00:43:17.385
follow me.

00:43:28.025 --> 00:43:29.585
Sir and madam, upstairs, please.

00:43:29.665 --> 00:43:30.505
Can't we go in there?

00:43:30.585 --> 00:43:31.825
We have an invitation.

00:43:31.905 --> 00:43:34.385
Please, go upstairs
to the Green Haitang Chamber.

00:43:34.465 --> 00:43:35.785
This young lady is a distinguished guest.
