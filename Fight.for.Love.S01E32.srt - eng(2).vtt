(Langkeng Fish Tavern)

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.560
I had such a hard time

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.480
finding you.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.790
Come on, General Chu.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.640
Look over here.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.200
Considering

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.870
you have difficulty walking,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.640
I made you

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.070
this Qiba Ox Chair.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.120
Take a look.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.960
What do you think?

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.950
Ox Chair?

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.630
It doesn't look like an ox.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.680
Let me try.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.120
How does it feel?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.960
Good, huh?

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.550
Feels good.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.870
This chair,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.190
in appearance and structure,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.560
bears a resemblance

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.750
to the Wooden Ox designed

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.590
by Zhuge Liang.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.960
Commander Lu, I guess

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.150
you named it after that.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.520
Quite knowledgeable.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.800
So, that's how it works.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.800
Can this chair

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.430
allow me to travel like the wind

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.840
or move across the ground?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.680
Well...

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.030
Neither.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.240
So, what makes it different

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.750
from my own chair?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.360
I could have made a better one.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.870
I had originally intended

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.840
to build you

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.080
a combat wheelchair.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.360
But the problem is,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.910
I think it's now

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:54.870
a time of peace.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.840
So, I gave it up.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.750
Instead of making a fancy chair,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.870
I prefer to make it practical.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.200
Look at your chair.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.560
It's big and heavy.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.030
And look at my little chair.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.910
It's light and handy.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.750
It's easy to fold and store.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.800
You can operate it

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.710
all by yourself

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.280
and move around freely.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.030
I put a lot of effort into this.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.840
General Chu,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.960
I'm quite thoughtful, right?

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.030
Thank you.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.430
We're buddies.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.360
Don't say that.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.630
It's good. Make one for me.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.750
Don't be kidding.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.080
I specially made this

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.920
for General Chu.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.920
You want one? Sure.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.200
I'll break your legs.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.190
Just kidding.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.990
Try it.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.280
Give it a try.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.030
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.960
Hurry up.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.120
- Try it.
- Come on. Try it.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.000
You try it yourself.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.840
Alright. I'll do it.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.030
It's effortless.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.710
See? Light, isn't it?

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.030
- Alright.
- Very agile.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.910
Turn around. Go.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.280
Come on. Move a few steps.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.840
Move. Move some steps.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.120
Go ahead.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.150
Move.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.120
They're too noisy.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.120
(Langkeng Fish Tavern)

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.030
It's quieter over here.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.750
What are you doing here?

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.280
I've missed you all day.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.520
Did you miss me?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.710
What's the use of that?

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.000
Today, you went to the palace

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.840
for a reward.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.950
So, Linyang and I came out

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:19.790
to have some fun.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.270
I...

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.400
Here's your Rose Dew.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.190
We won the battle,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.560
but I was very confused

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.750
and even bewildered.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.150
What for?

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.430
All of you contributed a lot.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.750
Why did His Majesty only make me

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.920
the God of War of Great Sui?

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.790
Today,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.270
I pleaded with His Majesty for us.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.510
Why did he even reprimand me?

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.960
His Majesty must have his reasons

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.830
for our country.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.310
You don't need to oppose him

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.350
because of me.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.560
But Yu...

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.040
We're willing to risk our lives

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.680
fighting for our country.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.240
Even if we suffer,

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.120
we never complain.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.830
We're giving it our all.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.040
But even our simplest joy

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040
has been denied.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.960
I don't understand.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.560
Nor do I want to.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.800
The highest may have a fall.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.800
This honor

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.240
may bring you trouble.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.480
You and I

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800
don't necessarily

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.870
have to get married.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.400
I don't care.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.520
But I care.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.190
You took the divorce paper

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.030
and went back home.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800
I want to marry you,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.680
with dignity.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.800
I don't want to remain worried

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.240
even when we meet in secret.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.560
Alright.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.680
Does it have to be so hard

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.160
to marry you?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.060
(Langkeng Fish Tavern)

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.520
General Chu,

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.720
Tuantuan sneaked off to Fengling City

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.630
without permission,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.920
so she's grounded now.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.390
She can't come here today.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.350
Is she alright?

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.600
Qingping helped me a lot.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.160
Whatever happens,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.160
I want her

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.950
to be safe and happy.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.120
That sounds familiar.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.030
Tuantuan

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.870
said something similar to me.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.600
General Chu,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.040
you don't need to deny

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.680
your care for someone you love.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.430
Life is already

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.360
hard enough.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.720
Don't be harsh to yourself.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.630
You seem to have tacitly accepted

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.560
their relationship.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.070
In your own case, I hope...

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.200
Yu made her choice.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.800
I won't interfere.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.720
Young Marquis Wei is trying his best

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.880
to be with Yu.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.130
When he's with her,

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.510
I feel relieved.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.240
As for the future,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.560
they need to face it themselves.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.160
You're quite reasonable

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.600
in your sister's case.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.920
I hope you can

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.070
do the same for yourself.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.470
- Come on, drink.
- Let's drink.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.360
I knew you were all here.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.800
- Jin.
- Jin.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.720
I went to your house.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.060
Your mother said you were asleep.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.560
Jin,

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.750
come and sit.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.870
Sit.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.270
Did you really go?

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.790
Of course. How would I leave you alone?

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.920
Madam,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.920
one more cup, please.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.510
I'll go fetch it.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.230
Jin.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.160
It's Rose Dew.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.720
Father loved it very much.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.870
You can taste some.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:00.790
Linyang,

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.790
I can drink now?

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.630
You're an adult now.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:04.790
Of course you can.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.630
Here.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.040
Alright.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.670
We are all here.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.350
It's so good.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.670
We're drinking and enjoying it.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.270
But our country is in crisis.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.590
We can't relax.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.360
I'm a woman,

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.390
but I can also fight off enemies

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.390
and defend Great Sui.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.360
I will make my name

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:32.750
go down in history.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.480
Of course.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.510
Who says women can't

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.390
fight battles?

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.590
A toast to you.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.920
Even if

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.000
I can't make peerless weapons,

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.320
no one in this world

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.720
can surpass me but myself.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:53.470
It makes sense.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.750
I...

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.590
Song Wenchang.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.120
What if I lost once?

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.240
I'll get up from where I fell.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.800
Song Wenchang

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.750
is done being a dandy.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.910
It's my turn.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.350
I, Chu Jin,

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840
can't save people

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.790
like Qingping,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.320
or fight battles

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320
like my sister.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.720
But

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.630
I will excel

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.470
in my own endeavors

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:15.840
and follow my own path.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.230
From this day on,

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.590
I will take

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.550
the peace of Great Sui as my mission

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.840
and let our country

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.000
enjoy a prosperous time.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:25.960
And me.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.840
My family's always been loyal,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.480
with many sacrifices.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.320
But when I'm around,

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.600
North Qi won't stand a chance.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.390
I will bring those who lost their homes

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.440
back home.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:38.840
Recover our lost hand.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.320
I know you all came here

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:43.840
to show your support for me.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.200
I'll also swear.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.200
I, Chu Linyang,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.390
have weak legs

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.510
and can't stand up.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.360
But I'm still determined

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.390
to protect our country.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.240
I can't fight now.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.510
Lu Qiba,

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.670
the only one who can beat you

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.080
is yourself.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.200
But I'm the one

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.840
who can help you.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.200
Good.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.470
Don't worry.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.600
I'll often come to bother you,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.440
General Chu.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.030
Despicable North Qi armies.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.150
They stole my blueprints

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.590
to make crossbows

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.630
and chariots.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.080
I also make this vow now.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.960
I will make

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.080
better weapons.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.720
We'll banish North Qi,

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.280
recover lost land,

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.360
and take back Her Highness.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.040
Cheers.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.360
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.200
Drink it up.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.670
Your Highness,

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.520
the king had someone

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.700
bring some Great Sui cuisine.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.080
He wanted you to eat.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.720
Zhao Yue trusts you a great deal, right?

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.200
I'm Ping.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.790
His Majesty sent me to serve you.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.840
To spy on me, is that it?

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.080
His Majesty said

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.390
I didn't need

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.510
to report anything to him.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.790
Now, you're here in our court.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.200
He can rest easy.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.500
Can he really be relieved?

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.550
Su Can is dead,

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.720
but he can't ascend the throne just yet.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.600
He must be very anxious.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.280
Don't worry.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.390
His Majesty

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.320
will get the throne.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.990
Mother.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.440
Mother.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.590
Mother.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.560
Mother.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.240
You're not a child anymore.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.270
Why are you still so reckless?

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.510
Mother,

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.680
I am back.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.510
This is how a future king

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:49.630
should behave.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.870
How I regret failing

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.720
to capture Fengling and Qingzhou.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.330
There's no rush.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.480
Now, Su Can is dead.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.270
North Qi

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.120
will belong to us.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.190
All these years in Great Sui,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.120
I often dreamed of my childhood

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.150
when I was with you.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.440
You...

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.870
You will take the throne soon.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.000
You must not

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.870
say anything like that.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.510
You must always remember.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.480
You're destined to be a king.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.120
In the future,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.960
you will rule the whole world.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.840
A sovereign must be ruthless.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.840
You must be ruthless to Mother.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.550
You must also be ruthless

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.670
towards Li Changming.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.160
Mother,

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.490
without her,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.820
I wouldn't have succeeded.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.360
Without her great power,

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:37.630
I wouldn't

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.470
have hidden there.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:39.940
That was before.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.870
Now,

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.580
you're going to be the King of North Qi.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.550
She is merely a tool to you.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.840
You must not develop feelings for her.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.840
I dealt with the Lord of Qin of Great Sui,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.750
and managed to get the three cities.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.390
If I had been swayed by emotion,

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.120
would we have come this far?

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:01.990
But things are different.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.730
She's in my country now.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.040
Mother,

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.630
why can't I

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.840
rule the world

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.000
and still be with the one I love?

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.990
What?

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.790
Are you blaming your mother

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.510
for that woman?

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:26.960
I wouldn't dare.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.960
You're just back

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.160
with little support.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.150
She's the Eldest Princess of Great Sui.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.320
If you're involved with her too much,

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.750
you'll be criticized.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.550
Right now,

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.320
your priority is to take the throne.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.840
Do you remember?

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.920
You're right, Mother.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.110
I'll keep it in mind.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.320
Remember.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.790
State affairs come first.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.480
The others don't matter.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.840
Yes.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.440
I'm tired.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.630
You go back for some rest.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.670
Mother, look at the vegetables
I just bought.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:13.710
Are they fresh?

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.320
Come on, Mother.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.150
Linyang went out for a drink yesterday,

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.360
and weren't you happy?

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.360
Why do you look so worried again?

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.000
I'm worried about your sister.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.150
It's really hard for her to be

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.440
with Wen Yun.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.200
Hi, Madam Chu.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.030
It's been quite some time

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.480
since you visited me, the matchmaker.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.630
Mother,

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:38.790
you went to see a matchmaker?

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.750
Some days ago,

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.840
I was worried

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.150
about your marriages.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.630
You know what?

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.910
Your eldest daughter is great.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.910
But no matter how beautiful she is,

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.030
she is a widow.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.510
She needs to remarry soon.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.840
Then, people will stop

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.240
gossiping about her.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.840
Madam Chu, are you worried

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.960
that the Marquis of Zhenguo

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.270
will be jealous?

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.830
Mother, don't listen to her.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.240
Let's go.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.350
I'd like to see

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:09.440
if you can recommend someone

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.790
worthy of my daughter.

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:12.200
If you fail,

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:13.790
I will smash

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.160
your reputation.

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:16.510
Come on, madam.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.720
I'll show you some.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.070
- Come this way.
- Mother.

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:19.910
Mother.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.140
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:25.640
Line up, please.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.310
Wait a minute here.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.150
Giving out food?

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.110
- Food?
- We'll have food.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.160
They're so kind.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.160
Come on.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.200
They're giving out food.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.760
- Here.
- Great.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.700
- Food, at last.
- Thank you.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.590
Here it is.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.590
Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.000
- Take it.
- Thank you.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.350
Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.190
Here. Take it.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.520
Yun.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.680
Since you're back,

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.000
you should check

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.640
our account books.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.150
Chun,

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.590
you do a great job in that.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.750
I won't check them.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.830
You should check them.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.200
Because of the war,

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.510
many refugees have fled here.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.980
Chun and I agreed

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.200
to give out some porridge.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.000
Our expenses will be

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.160
much higher than usual.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.350
You should check it.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.160
Giving out food is a worthy cause.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.350
Lan, you have my full support.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.510
We should go now.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:26.430
Found it.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.500
(Spring Breeze House)

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:35.590
This way, please.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.280
Madam Chu, come in, please.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.640
Come upstairs, please.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.000
Thank you.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:45.400
My Lady.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.480
Another zither player.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.070
Let's go. You don't get it.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.950
My Lady.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.510
Why must Madam

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.400
take you here?

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.550
I don't know.

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:58.390
It's strange.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.000
Mother.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.270
Why have we suddenly

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.160
come here?

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.270
You'll meet someone here.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:08.590
Meet someone?

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.110
Who would I meet?

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:14.590
Yu,

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.200
I've come to know

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.640
why you married Wen Jun.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.880
You're young,

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.270
but have to sacrifice so much.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.590
You never complained,

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.400
but I feel sorry.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.110
Mother.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:29.480
I've given it a lot of thought.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.200
If he truly loves you,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.160
why hasn't he proposed to you yet?

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.920
He must have second thoughts

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.750
now that he's in a position of power.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.110
No.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.960
We've just returned.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.440
And we need some time

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.200
for the past rumors to fade.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.240
Have you forgotten about it

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:51.550
when our plaque

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:52.550
was defaced with ink?

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.310
Silly girl.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.480
With the divorce paper,

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.160
you're a single woman.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.550
Besides,

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.640
you were badly injured

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.720
in the battles.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.030
I think

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.720
if you don't start planning

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.830
for your own future,

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.880
it will be too late.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:14.510
Oh, Madam Chu.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.680
You've finally come.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.760
- Ms. Bao.
- Today,

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:18.830
many talented young men

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.510
will attend the poetic gathering here.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:21.680
You can

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.330
take a good look at them

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.490
with your daughter.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.000
This way, please.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.830
You know exactly

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.030
who is spoken for

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.070
and who is available.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.030
- Rest assured.
- So,

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.110
- it's a blind date.
- The rich families in town

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.950
and noble families...

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:34.840
I can't leave now.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.550
I know everything

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.310
about them.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.440
This way, please.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.190
Come on. Take a look.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.040
There they are.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.000
- This is Song Shilan,
- Go upstairs, please.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.200
the son of Duke of Ning's concubine.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.680
He's talented

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:50.830
in civil and military.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.720
He made contributions in Qingzhou,

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.660
following Young Marquis Wei.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.960
Now,

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.680
he's a popular young man to be selected.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.240
We know this man.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.080
He won't do.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.440
He's Song Wenchang's brother.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.510
If I marry him,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.830
I'd have to call Jin

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:05.720
"Elder Sister".

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.190
Awkward hierarchy.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.240
I didn't think of that.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.510
Then, look at that man.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.670
- Vice Minister Zhang Anl.
- Sit, please.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:13.720
He's good-looking

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.760
and even-tempered.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.110
He's a legitimate child.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.350
Most importantly,

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.640
he was very devoted to his wife.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:20.630
What do you mean?

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.240
Will Chu Yu be his concubine?

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.920
How would I dare?

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.310
Zhang An's wife

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.030
passed away over a year ago.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.110
So, he's a good match

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.750
for your daughter.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.830
No.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.200
He's cursed in marriage.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.040
I don't approve.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.720
Then, this one.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.350
- Compared to General Song,
- Go upstairs, please.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.400
this one is riding high on his career.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.480
He's now Minister of Personnel.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.480
His Majesty holds him in high regard

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.790
and has appointed him

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:47.920
as Junior Tutor to the Crown Prince.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.270
Mr. Gu

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.880
is now divorced from Ms. Wang.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.550
And Ms. Chu Yu

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.790
should be familiar to him.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.680
He still has feelings

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.590
for you, anyway.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.680
How do you know that?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.030
Every time I matchmake for him,

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.610
he tells me his heart still belongs

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.160
to you.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.440
A good man doesn't backtrack.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.080
Any other options?

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.480
Will you really not consider him?

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.310
You certainly have

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.000
extraordinary taste.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.350
That one.

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:29.680
That is Censor Wang.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.310
He's also a young talent.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.000
What do you think?

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.350
Hi, Gu.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.630
Chusheng, sit.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.160
Today,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.000
I have some good news

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.110
to tell you, Zhang.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.910
What is that?

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.910
The Duke of Ning

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.350
has resumed peace talks.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.950
This time,

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.960
His Majesty consented.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.680
What kind of good news is that?

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.110
Theoretically,

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.190
North Qi is in chaos

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.270
for its king's recent death.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:07.680
It's the best time

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.520
to attack them.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.030
But...

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:10.870
I understand.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.680
Before Her Highness

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.680
comes back from North Qi,

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.240
an attack won't be authorized.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:17.150
But Her...

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:20.680
Even though Her Highness

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.920
was deceived by Zhao Yue,

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.940
she could still pose a threat.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.510
Now, all the officials

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.480
speak critically of Her Highness.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:28.640
No one wants

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.960
to undertake the peace talks.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.310
Even worse, if someone goes there,

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:33.550
he might lose his life.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.550
I know.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:37.390
As friends,

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:38.960
you want my career to be smooth.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.640
But in this world,

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.400
some sacrifice everything

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.240
for their ambitions

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.670
while others seek

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.680
only a stable life.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.480
And I

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.030
happen to be the latter.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.760
It's just my advice.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.680
Zhang, don't overthink it.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:57.200
Chusheng is right.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:58.240
Come on, let's drink.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.630
Cheer.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.640
Isn't that Ms. Chu Yu?

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.830
What is she doing here?

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:15.390
I'll be right back.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.110
Are you curious

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.000
why Gu can't let go of his feelings

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:32.150
for Ms. Chu Yu?

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.310
I'm just curious

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.960
why everyone

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.510
gets so hung up on love.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.880
I have no interest

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.920
in romance whatsoever.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.920
Think about it.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.510
Why is no one ambitious?

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.000
Why don't they want success?

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.880
I don't understand.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.310
Those who get stuck in love

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.310
are all successful, aren't they?

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.840
For example,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.110
the one who just rushed over.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.070
That sounds a bit hurtful.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.550
Does none of them meet your standards?

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.800
Any more options?

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.270
- Umm...
- My Lady,

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.110
Gu Chusheng is here.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.070
Madam Chu,

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.960
it's been years

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.110
and I haven't visited you.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.520
My apologies.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.160
It's kind of you, Mr. Gu.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.030
What a coincidence to meet you.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.040
It's not.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.440
I came here for Chu Yu.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.680
For me?

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:30.920
Why?

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.920
Why are you so on guard?

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.440
Every time I see you,

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.510
it seems there's bad news.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.200
Do you hate me so much now?

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:39.800
- Gu Chusheng.
- Try this.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.200
I was thinking

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.880
you usually act honorably in big cases.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.070
That's why I didn't want to argue here.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.400
Before you do anything,

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.200
you'd better think carefully.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.880
You're here for a matchmaking session.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.400
Why can't I try one more time?

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.030
What's that?

00:25:59.030 --> 00:25:59.870
And look at this.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:01.900
(Hope you feel as I do.
I won't fail our love.)

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.230
(Flowers bloom. I want you back.)
Hope you feel as I do.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.240
I won't fail our love.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:06.390
It's...

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.350
On the day Qingzhou fell,

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.480
I was kneeling,

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.310
subjected to humiliation over and over.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.350
I was thinking of you, then.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:19.630
Chu Yu,

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.880
even if you hate me,

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.960
I don't want to miss this chance.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.160
I turned down all marriage proposals

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.350
because I was waiting for you.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.400
It doesn't matter if you're Ms. Chu

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.110
or Mrs. Wei,

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.960
I don't care.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:36.670
Yu,

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.960
I just hope you feel as I do.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.310
I won't fail our love.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:46.750
Isn't that Marquis of Zhenguo?

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.510
Why is he also here?

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.630
Come in, please.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.570
Your dishes are all served. Enjoy them.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.000
Isn't that His Lordship?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.840
Yeah.

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.580
(Flowers bloom.
I want you back. By Gu Chusheng)

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.640
Why are you here?

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.480
If I hadn't come,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.110
your mother would have

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.950
found you a husband.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.550
Since when can my mother

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:13.590
make decisions for me?

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.790
Young Marquis,

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:19.920
are you here for tea as well?

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.440
I suppose you also

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.440
came here to see

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.350
who Mrs. Wei would choose.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:28.590
I'm not here

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.720
just for tea.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.240
No matter what,

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.400
you're not

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.790
the right man for me, Mr. Gu.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.640
So, help yourself.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.070
Stay calm.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.880
Obviously, he's provoking you.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.240
I know.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.350
But when you remain my weakness,

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.590
people will never stop

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.830
using you against me.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.590
And you will get hurt at last.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.240
Yu,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.550
I don't need you

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:00.480
to always protect me.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.110
Ms. Chu is here to choose a husband,

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.680
and I am still unmarried.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.110
Why can't I be

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.640
one of her options?

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.280
Wei Yun.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.630
Wei Yun,

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.000
do you realize the consequences of this?

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.750
Since I dared to come here,

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.550
I'm not afraid of any consequences.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.480
Since Madam Chu is

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.320
choosing a husband

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:10.720
for Ms. Chu Yu,

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.790
I have something to say.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:16.200
Madam Chu,

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.350
Yu and I fought together,

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.190
and I fell in love.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.720
Later, we risked our lives

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.560
in those two cities.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.760
It made us realize

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:23.110
our feelings for each other.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.070
Our relationship is genuine.

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.400
We went through everything.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.160
So, I can't let her

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.240
marry someone else.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.350
Nor do I want us

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.680
to remain ambiguous in the world.

if you must have an answer today,

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.550
I will give it to you.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.440
Wei Yun

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.520
is the man

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.960
I love.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.510
He is now.

today,

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.160
you dared to declare this

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.240
in public.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.160
I'm quite relieved.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:33.750
You have

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.080
my family's blessing.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.110
I also believe that your relationship

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:40.440

Some time ago,

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.640
Yu obtained her Letter of Release.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.550
She dedicated herself entirely

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:49.350
to revitalize your family,

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.790
which delayed her until now.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.920
Please allow me

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:57.790
to take her home,

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.720
so we can discuss your marriage.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:03.670
Yu,

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.200
let's go home.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.950
I'll wait for you.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.080
I expect their wedding.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.000
I never thought the two of them

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.830
would end up together.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:29.740
Come on.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.110
I think those two

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.030
make a perfect couple.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.780
They're very well-matched.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.550
What about Mr. Gu?

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:49.200
Too bad for him.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:04.110
My Lady,

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.680
are you still thinking

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.520
about what happened?

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.830
Look at you.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.070
My effort there

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.350
isn't wasted.

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.390
Mother, I have to ask.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.350
Did you bring me there

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.550
because that matchmaker

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:17.480
came to you

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.320
and persuaded you to?

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:20.550
I wanted

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.640
to let you meet more gentlemen

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.750
and urge Young Marquis Wei.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.070
Isn't that killing two birds

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.910
with one stone?

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.760
So...

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:29.200
As expected, Young Marquis Wei

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.240
is a man of his word.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.480
From this day on,

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.200
he's the man

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.040
I've admired most.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.080
Of course.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.550
Wei Yun is certainly the best.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.480
But Gu Chusheng

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:41.790
is rather snobbish.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.160
He likes me,

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.480
but he never

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.320
puts me first.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.350
Today, he made a big scene.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.350
It seems that he was targeting me.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.720
But actually, I was a mere bait.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.400
He wanted to anger Wei Yun.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.040
Chusheng,

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:13.750
what you did today

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.950
was deliberate, huh?

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:19.590
But...

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:20.960
You and Young Marquis

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.720
were on better terms.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.480
Why did you provoke him

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.510
to confess his love?

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.920
His Majesty ordered me.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.720
His Majesty doesn't want him

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:31.870
to be stuck in love.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.550
He needs a pretext.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.240
And I am

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.720
the blade in his hand.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:40.440
I didn't want to,

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:42.750
but I had no choice.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.240
Young Marquis Wei is clever.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.550
He realized it was a trap,

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.830
but he jumped in it resolutely.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.030
He didn't even hesitate.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.030
He knew His Majesty

00:33:59.030 --> 00:33:59.960
was wary of it.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.440
But he still confessed his love.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.510
I helped His Majesty to set him up.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:06.440
But in my heart,

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.070
I don't feel good.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:11.630
But a man's heart is

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.480
the hardest to see through.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.760
I'm totally confused.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.400
Why must some people

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.800
get stuck

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.000
in this romance thing?

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.070
Guys,

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.190
what are you talking about?

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.880
I don't understand a word.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.670
Come on, Zhang.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:32.510
Let's drink.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:45.950
Your Lordship,

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.190
you confessed your love

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.030
in public.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.760
What if it spreads

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.000
throughout the city again?

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:56.150
I was trying to make a big scene,

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:59.070
so I wouldn't be controlled.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.160
Why don't I

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.440
understand that?

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.400
Did Mr. Gu not confess his love

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.360
for personal reasons?

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.320
Is there anything else behind it?

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.510
He did that for personal reasons.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:15.800
But I just would not

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.640
let him have his way.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:20.920
What Gu Chusheng did today

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.360
made me see clearly one thing.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.400
His Majesty is using him

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.400
and the people

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.840
to make me the God of Great Sui.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:29.960
But isn't that your ambition

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.760
to be the hero of Great Sui

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.800
and guardian of its people?

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.440
I want to be a true hero

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.320
for our people,

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:41.320
not the only God of Great Sui

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.190
appointed by His Majesty.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.710
If I accept this favor,

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.070
I will be second

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:48.910
only to His Majesty.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.280
But meanwhile, I will be

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.480
a target for other officials.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.280
My family

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.400
will also be too prominent.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.330
If the favor remained,

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:57.190
that would be fine.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:59.320
But if one day, I make a mistake

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:00.440
and loses favor,

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.280
I will instantly

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.400
become a target of blame.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:05.480
In this game,

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.400
I need to think far ahead before I act.

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:13.080
If one day, I take one wrong step,

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.110
I will totally lose.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:22.880
(Biography of The General in White)
What does it have to do

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.720
with your confession?

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.030
(Record of Fengling)

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:26.750
(Marquis of Zhenguo)
Because in their eyes,

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.030
Chu Yu is a stain

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.200
in my life.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.670
So, they're trying

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.510
every possible means

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:34.840
to remove this stain.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.670
But they miscalculated

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.030
how much I care for Chu Yu

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.450
and underestimated

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.920
how much I hated to be controlled.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.990
I thought

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.030
everything would go smoothly

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.230
after we returned in triumph.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.470
Unexpectedly,

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.960
there are simmering conflicts in town.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.510
When Father and Brothers

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:57.350
were alive,

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.960
I could be General Wei

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.880
living a carefree life.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.070
I thought the noble title

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.070
was an honor.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.760
But when I became

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.920
the Marquis of Zhenguo,

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.590
I finally realized

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.400
how difficult it was for my father

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.720
to guide our family.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.150
I'm afraid this battle of wits

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:35.000
will be even harder
than defending the cities.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:53.550
(What's to come)

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:55.710
(is to come.)

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.070
Mrs. Wei,

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.150
sorry for the wait.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.400
Come with me, please.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.880
Thanks, Eunuch Huang.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.760
Dismissed.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.160
Wei Yun,

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:24.350
you stay.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:28.180
(Xuanzheng Hall)

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:35.580
That's good.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.280
Wei Yun,

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.230
recently,

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:48.000
I've received many memorials.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.000
You're mentioned in many of them.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.150
Now, you have truly become

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:54.150
a pillar of the state.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.800
So many people are concerned about you.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.240
And it happened

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.710
that you told me
about Chu Yu's contributions

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.110
on the battlefield.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.960
I've been thinking

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.960
how I should reward her.

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:07.910
Now,

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.400
I've made a decision.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.800
I will bestow upon Chu Yu a title.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.070
Lady Zhaohua.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:20.510
What do you think?

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.710
