WEBVTT

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.100
Here we go!

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.740
This is amazing!

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.930
An amusement park...

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.530
I was so sure it'd be boring.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.430
At least, that's what I thought this morning.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600
But...

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.030
this might be the most fun I've ever had in my life.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.200
"Therapy Game"

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.100
(Episode 3)

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.450
This one...

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.330
It's a roller coaster called the "Kingfisher."

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.840
It dips and flies over the water with sharp turns,
just like a kingfisher in flight.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.450
Even if I really want to win him over,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.640
this feels more like torture.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.700
Are you not having fun?

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.770
I know I dragged you out here.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.710
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.450
It's not your fault.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.270
It's just...

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.300
seeing all these happy families and couples...

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.900
it makes me feel a little out of place.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.530
Oh, right.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.120
It's my first time at a place like this.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.510
I'm just not used to it yet.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.570
Your first time?

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.610
Yeah.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.370
I didn't know people like you still existed.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.790
Huh?

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:58.970
I've decided.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.770
Your first time...

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.320
I'll make sure it's the best experience ever.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.000
I promise you'll have a great time.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.750
Okay.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.130
Hey.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.890
Let's go.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.450
No need to run!

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.450
I'm getting nervous.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.340
Ah.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.420
Here, let's put this down.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.870
- Oh, thanks.
- Yup.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.080
Whoa.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.050
- It's moving.
- It's moving.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.420
Wow.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.600
- So fast.
- So fast.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.010
For this part, everyone puts their hands up.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.460
Yeah, just like that! Whoa!

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.910
- Oh no.
- Here we go!

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.910
Wait!

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.880
Ah, that was fun.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.320
Hey, what's next?

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.170
Minato, are you okay?

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880
What?

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.420
I'm fine...

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.590
Hey.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.300
Your hands are shaking.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.260
There, that's better.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040
Yeah.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Oh.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.830
Hey, let's ride this one.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.360
- Okay.
- So cool.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.900
Hey, wait, isn't this a little close?

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.090
This seat is tiny.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.070
It feels a little too close for comfort.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.010
Oh no, oh no, we're taking off.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.240
If you ride this a few more times,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.630
- you might be able to handle a roller coaster.
- It just spins and spins.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:00.690
Right.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.810
It was super fun.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Yeah, it was.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.700
It was more...

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.690
- intense than I expected.
- Yeah, it was really fun.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.240
You know,

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.170
a ride like that... that kind of...

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.970
that moves around like that...

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.270
This was my first time riding one.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.550
It even made those whooshing sounds.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.540
Yeah, it was great.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.090
What are you smiling about?

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.090
Huh?

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.230
Nothing.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.920
It's just that, when you come to a place like this,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.330
you smile like a little kid.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.700
Oh, shut up.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.230
This is bad.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.530
What am I doing?

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.530
I came here to win over Shizuma,

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.450
but I'm the one getting totally into it.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.270
Ah, I'm kinda...

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.810
I'm getting hungry.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.640
Wanna get something to eat?

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.240
Yeah.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.350
Let's eat there.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.760
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.360
Mmm.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.040
This is so good.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.320
What is it?

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.620
It's a White Tiger-yaki with custard filling.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.460
Mine is okonomiyaki flavor.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.750
Okonomiyaki, huh.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.460
Shizuma.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.820
Hm?

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.270
- So cute.
- Hey, so suddenly? Stop it.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.250
You're so cute.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.590
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.570
- Can I have a bite of yours?
- This one?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.930
- Yeah.
- Sure.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.760
Mmm.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.300
Hey, this one's really good too.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.430
The white tigers here are really popular.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.210
I see.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.090
Animals?

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.740
You've never been to a zoo?

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.720
Nope.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.650
Then let's go later.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.670
He's completely different from my first impression.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.710
To be honest,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.260
it's a lot of fun hanging out with him.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.010
I don't have to try to please him,
and he doesn't walk on eggshells around me.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.160
It's been a long time since I've felt like this.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.730
Wow!

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.550
The white tiger is a white variant of the Bengal tiger.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.860
This "white variant"

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.110
means they have a gene that
gives them their white fur.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.890
It's said that their chance of appearing
in the wild is only one in 10,000.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.660
Whoa.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.530
So cool.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.030
Whoa.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.460
Ah.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.280
Wow.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.940
Hey, it's so fast.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.670
Minato...

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.380
Shizuma...

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.930
What's with you all of a sudden?

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.360
Now you're the one who looks upset.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.590
What's wrong?

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.370
Sorry.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.020
No spacing out when you're with me.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.480
I was just remembering something.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.560
Don't tell me it's about your ex-girlfriend.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.630
You don't have to go reopening old wounds.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.960
Besides, last time,

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.130
you didn't even resent the woman who cheated on you.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.530
You smiled and forgave her, right?

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.490
You're seriously such a good guy.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.370
I think that's really cool.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.470
Everyone is so eager to make friends.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.980
But being too trusting is just asking to get hurt.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.160
Should we head over there?

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.030
Huh?

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.060
Shizuma?

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.100
What are you doing?

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.110
Hey.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.780
Wait, hold on.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.290
How do you even manage
to take a picture like this?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.120
I'd rather you not take pictures of me like that.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.480
Uh, sorry.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600
Just kidding.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:34.950
I just figured you'd take pictures of people you like.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.230
No, I know I'm a terrible photographer.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.650
But if I don't take them,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.890
I can't properly hold onto the memories.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.150
Well... I'm actually a photographer.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.480
Huh?

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.680
Huh? A professional?

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.340
Yeah.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.590
So, how about I teach you how to take a good picture?

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:57.810
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.880
That'd be a huge help.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.980
Here.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.100
Shizuma.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.530
Come over here.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.870
You hold it.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.490
Oh, this?

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.750
- Right here.
- Ah.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.390
First,

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.890
once you've decided on your subject,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.630
you have to check if there's anything
extra in the frame.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.550
Let's crop out a little bit of the foreground.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.440
See?

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.400
Doesn't that look much cleaner now?

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.010
He's really handsome.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.000
His skin,

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.120
and his hair... they're completely different from mine.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.440
With looks like this,
even if I was drunk and made a move...

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.260
No.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.900
Even if I wasn't drunk...

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.160
Hey, are you watching?

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.990
Oh, yeah.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.900
You're right.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.340
It's completely different.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.790
That's amazing.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.070
Mhm.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.630
Smells so good.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.520
Minato.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.670
What was that for all of a sudden?

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.160
- This is payback for earlier.
- Hey wait, that's so...

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.200
- You made a great face.
- Delete it!

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.380
- No way.
- Please.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.760
It's a great expression, isn't it?

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.060
The view during the day was nice,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.440
but it has a completely different vibe at night.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:30.810
It's beautiful.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.090
Man, that was intense.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.470
Wanna go again?

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.260
I didn't know you could be so mean.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.340
Sorry, sorry.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.230
Hey.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.510
Go stand over there.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360
Okay.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.560
Here we go.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.450
Hey, I don't like that pose.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.520
Hmm.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.270
How's this?

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:13.950
Ah.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.290
You're actually really good at this.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.740
Right?

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.830
Hey, Shizuma.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.350
One last thing.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.770
Shouldn't we get a picture together?

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.500
Okay.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.000
Okay, smile.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:27.890
One more.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.280
Three, two...

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:31.570
One.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720
Mmm.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.990
This came out really nice.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.160
It's a great shot.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.700
Hey, Shizuma.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.310
How about a souvenir shot of that?

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.950
- That?
- Yeah.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.960
Go ahead, take it.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.320
Me?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Alright.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.140
How's this?

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.500
Hmm...

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.530
If you turn your phone sideways,

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.170
you can probably get a wider shot, right?

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.030
See?

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.240
What's wrong with me?

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.710
He's a guy.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.530
And we just met.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.730
We barely know anything about each other.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:23.930
But...

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.160
Why do I feel so...?

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.230
Shohei.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.220
If you ever felt for another man...

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.600
a heart-pounding feeling
like you've never felt before...

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.650
- what would you do?
- I don't see anything wrong with that.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.450
I'd just think, "This is great."
"I like him."

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.370
Just be honest with yourself and accept those feelings.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.460
Well?

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.090
Are you starting to like it a little?

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.700
Taking pictures.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.110
Oh.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.260
You know, taking pictures...

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.830
isn't just about capturing
the scenery you see.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.170
The memories of that moment,

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.980
and the emotions, they all get preserved too, right?

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.220
That's what I like about it.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.390
But...

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.180
if you get blackout drunk,
it doesn't matter what pictures you take.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.520
That was my fault.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.880
I'm serious.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.990
I'll never forget you again.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:22.110
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.110
Shizuma.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.370
You might just forget
everything about today too.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:28.810
Why...?

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.980
I'm kidding.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.780
Saying that with that look on your face

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.320
just makes you even more unforgettable.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.300
So please, don't...

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.940
say such sad things anymore.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.160
We thank all our guests for visiting the park today.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.070
We sincerely thank you...

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:09.390
It's already that time.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.500
Our operating hours will soon...

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.630
Looks like it.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.280
I see.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.250
The amusement park rides...

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.690
Everything about today...

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.260
- I'm sure I'll never forget it for the rest of my life.
- Your phone.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.150
It's the first time I've ever met someone

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.310
who I can't take my eyes off of.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.610
- Everything was really fun.
- I'm so glad.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.080
Um...

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.490
- Hmm?
- I booked a room here too.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.940
Is that okay?

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.470
You're asking me if it's okay?

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:56.890
Of course, it is.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.910
Just so you know,

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.180
I'm the type of person who cleans his plate,
no matter what's served.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.820
That's good.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.570
Then let's go.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.880
Yeah.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:14.590
Whoa!

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.830
This is so luxurious.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.270
Huh?

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.000
And you can see the city lights. This is amazing.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.430
Yeah.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.830
What do you think?

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.430
Whoa.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:45.830
Cheers.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.390
Mmm.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.980
This is delicious.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.790
Earlier,

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.570
when we were waiting in line for the rides,

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.660
you were biting your lip, weren't you?

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.330
Is that a habit you have when you're irritated?

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.210
Were you watching me?

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.680
That's... kind of creepy.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.050
Observing people is a habit of mine.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:18.840
Animals can't talk,

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.370
so you have to observe them.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.250
Animals?

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.160
Oh, right. You're a vet student.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.410
So, am I an animal?

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.880
Sorry.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.100
Ah.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:36.770
By the way.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.800
Trying to find you at the university

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.120
was a real pain.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:41.690
Oh, really?

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.460
Yeah. They even suspected
I was the one who took your student ID.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.040
But in the end,

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.440
that upperclassman helped me out.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.650
Sorry for the trouble.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.410
Ah.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.390
But,

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.440
thanks to all that effort,

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.020
I get to stay in a nice room and eat good food
on someone else's dime.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.270
Plus, I get this amazing night view. It's perfect.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.940
I didn't know one could get treated this well on their birthday.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.090
It's not your birthday.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.280
Coming.

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:25.840
Mr. Ikushima.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.770
This is the final item in the birthday package:
the birthday cake.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.880
I was just thinking I wanted some cake.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:37.670
Is it okay?

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.280
To eat someone else's birthday cake?

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.410
Yeah, I don't mind at all.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.290
Here.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.200
Mmm.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.600
- Ahh. - No, thanks.
- Why not?

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:08.650
Did you have fun today?

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:11.960
It was pretty good.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.050
But you can't possibly finish seeing everything
in just one day.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.570
I wanted to see more of the animals.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.840
Then,

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.220
how about we do it the other way around next time?

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.630
That way,

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:24.830
we can do the amusement park rides

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.370
and see all the animals, right?

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:31.750
What's wrong?

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.620
You know,

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.090
when I was little,

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.800
my parents passed away.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.170
I never really did any proper family activities.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:49.450
Amusement parks,

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:50.980
aquariums,

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.460
zoos... I've never been to any of them.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.620
And of course, I never went on trips.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.010
But everyone around me

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.160
would always talk about what they did with their families,

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.960
where they went, and stuff like that.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.840
They always looked so happy.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.460
So I always felt really bitter about it.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.040
Just because it reminds me of all that,

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.470
I used to absolutely hate places like this.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.700
But you know,

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.340
I'm really glad I came today.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.290
For you to say that...

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.380
it makes me happy too.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.600
By the way,

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.490
- this is my first time on a date like this, too.
- Huh?

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.750
Surprised?

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.350
Did you think I was some kind of player?

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:42.540
Huh? So have you ever been in a relationship?

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.030
No.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.040
Never.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.520
And I don't need one either.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.820
That kind of relationship.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.840
This whole "love" thing...

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.130
If you get your hopes up,

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.820
doesn't it just hurt more when you get betrayed?

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.380
Even your own parents aren't guaranteed to love you.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.000
So how could you trust a stranger?

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.380
There's no way you could trust one, right?

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.030
A stranger...

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.300
Does that include me?

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.110
What?

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.060
Why would you ask that?

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.960
What am I doing?

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.600
What is it that I want him to say to me?

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.110
No, it's nothing.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:33.630
You can sleep here.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.460
- I'll sleep in the next room.
- Wait.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.450
It's fine if you stay here.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:39.810
Don't go.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.460
Why?

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:43.730
You're asking me why...

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920
No way...

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.080
The bed's right here.
It'd be a waste not to use it, right?

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.290
Besides, you're the one who invited me.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.970
This is what you wanted too, isn't it?

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.050
Let's do it.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.160
Let's pick up where we left off.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.830
You can do whatever you want.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.750
And...

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.530
things like, "I like you,"

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.180
or "Let's be a couple."

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.940
I swear I'll never bring up any of that complicated stuff.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:27.390
That's perfect for you, right?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
I see.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.120
Minato.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.340
I'm in love with you.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:32.860
(Preview)
There's no way nothing happened.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.300
You went on an amusement park date
and even spent the night.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.430
Your brother...
Things are going really well for him, huh?

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.030
To me, you've become...

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.050
someone I can't just fool around with anymore.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.970
I don't want to hurt Shizuma...

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.530
and I don't want to leave you.
