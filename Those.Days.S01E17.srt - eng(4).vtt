=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.780
=Episode 17=

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:20.880
When my mother gave Mingzhu to you,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.080
she did it behind my back.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.720
When I gave birth to her,
I had a major hemorrhage.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.520
I was lying on that hospital bed,
half-dead.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.039
I really

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.640
knew nothing about this.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.440
My mother also told me

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.640
she gave you our address.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.440
She told me

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.160
the young couple who adopted my child

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.039
promised

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.960
they'd bring her back to us one day.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.919
But you never came.

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:47.600
My mother couldn't rest in peace
when she died.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.279
That's the truth.

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:49.559
What a fabricated story!

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:50.520
She gave us an address?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.440
What address?

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.600
There was no address.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.760
She didn't give us anything.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.426
I was in the hospital
after a miscarriage,

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.800
and you had just had twins.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.080
Yes.

00:01:57.093 --> 00:01:58.360
Your family was struggling,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.559
so you kept the boy

00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:00.600
and gave away the girl.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.130
That's not...

00:02:01.137 --> 00:02:02.390
You said we could take her.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.080
And you said,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.919
"Raise her as your own.
Let's never contact each other again."

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:07.160
No, that's not true!

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.360
It's not! My mother wouldn't do that.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.999
You can't say that.

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.679
That's not what my mother told me.

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:13.960
Not what your mother told you?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.782
Your mother did many
things behind your back.

00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:17.871
She gave your daughter
away without your knowledge,

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:18.360
didn't she?

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.360
Please stop.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.360
Please just stop.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.800
I'm sorry. This is our fault.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.480
It's all our fault, okay?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.520
I won't say anything more.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.159
Mingzhu.

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.080
Please forgive Mommy, okay?

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.040
I'm sorry.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.999
What did you say?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.920
What Mommy?

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.080
Whose mommy?

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.520
The audacity of you.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.520
Thirty years ago,
during the hardest times,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.839
you threw your child away

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:45.320
and never looked back.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.800
We were the ones

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.839
who raised her.

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:48.399
You're right.

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:49.399
And 30 years later,

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:51.439
when she finally has a decent life,

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.520
you show up to claim her?

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.080
That's not...

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.559
You want all the benefits
without any of the work!

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:55.839
What do you actually want?

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:56.480
Nothing...

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.804
Is it money? Support payments?

00:02:57.804 --> 00:03:00.420
Or is it that your son is getting
married and you need the money?

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:02.080
I bet you need money for a wedding!

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.893
No! That's not it!

00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:04.590
Then what is it?

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.640
- That's not it!
- Where have you been

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.599
for the last 30 years? Where were you?

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.520
It wasn't like that! It wasn't!

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.520
Please listen to me.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.439
I didn't personally

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:17.520
give her to you,

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.080
and you know that.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.800
Did my mother give you
our address or not?

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.719
You know better than I do

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:31.839
who her real mother is.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.679
You know the answer.

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:36.960
Yu Jingxiang!

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.960
I...

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.040
I'm sorry. I'm her husband.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.599
Come with me.

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.439
I...

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:41.119
I...

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.839
Look at me.

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.040
Look at me!

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.719
What are you doing?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.999
What did you promise me?

00:03:47.982 --> 00:03:49.480
Do you not want to claim her anymore?

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.879
Alright, enough. Let's go home.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.119
Help your mother.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.360
We're sorry about this.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.520
Stop looking. Stop.

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.800
Mom.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.919
Is it true what she said just now?

00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:21.350
That they left an address?

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.799
There was no address.

00:04:23.799 --> 00:04:25.599
Really, there wasn't.

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:30.399
Mingzhu...

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.799
I'm telling you the truth.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.839
Alright, I got it.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.359
I should go to work.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.719
Maybe you should

00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:48.390
just take the day off today?

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.839
Rest for a day.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.599
Okay?

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.880
It's fine.

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:58.359
I'm going to be a mother myself soon.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.520
I can handle a little turbulence.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.320
I should get going.

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.279
Stay safe.

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:08.560
Be careful.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.200
Okay.

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.680
Yu Jingxiang,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.039
how many times have I told you?

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:35.440
Zhixia was worried you'd

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.479
act impulsively!

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.760
She made me swear not to tell you!

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.880
And she was right about you.

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:42.599
Why did you go there?

00:05:43.648 --> 00:05:45.520
Don't you want to claim
your daughter anymore?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.640
Dad, cut her some slack.

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:50.000
Mom,

00:05:50.604 --> 00:05:52.337
maybe we shouldn't force
this relationship.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.790
You're heartbroken, and you're
putting them in a difficult position.

00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:55.782
That's crap!

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.200
Xu Zhidong, your sister was given away

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.599
because of you!

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:07.520
I can't acknowledge
my own flesh and blood.

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:10.839
My mother is gone.

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:13.640
After all this time,
you're still cursing her?

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.399
I don't want to live anymore!

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.030
- I'm going to kill you!
- Look, Xiang...

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:19.560
Let's die together!

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.640
- Yu Jingxiang!
- Let's die!

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.599
Yu Jingxiang!

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:22.799
- Let's die!
- Listen!

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.440
Your mom has gone mad!

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:26.080
- Die!
- Yu Jingxiang!

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.719
- Mom!
- Let's die!

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:27.399
Calm down!

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.880
Yu Jingxiang!

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.320
Dad!

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.839
Let go!

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:29.799
Stop!

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.200
Dad, hold it!

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.279
You can't fight back!

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.560
Don't push me!

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.359
What's going on now?

00:06:35.648 --> 00:06:36.640
Has your mom gone mad?

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.760
Dad, Grandpa's fighting with Grandma.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.440
Yu Jingxiang!

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760
Since no one's cooking,

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:42.440
let's go have hotpot instead.

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:43.520
Let's go.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.719
We're having hotpot.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.799
Bye, Grandpa, Grandma.

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:48.960
We're having hotpot!

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:54.599
Let go!

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:08.320
It's so unfair.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.039
You know what she said to me today?

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:11.200
Miss,

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.440
you know better than I do

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.159
who her real mother is.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.640
You know the answer.

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:18.919
What does "real mother" even mean?

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.520
When she was

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.799
just a baby,

00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:28.479
I was the one who raised her,
through all the hardship!

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.279
Remember when she was sickly?

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:32.839
I took her out every day...

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.719
- Alright now.
- For IV drips.

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:37.560
I couldn't sleep well for nights.

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:38.560
I know.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.520
And you were

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.200
so busy with work

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.479
because we were poor.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.520
And that's not all,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.680
you know what else she said?

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.880
She said she hemorrhaged badly,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.279
and she didn't know her mom

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:51.320
would give her child away.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.520
She didn't know!

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.760
Maybe she didn't know at first,

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.830
but for 30 years? All these years,
and she never knew?

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:56.479
Yes.

00:07:56.599 --> 00:07:58.760
Their family does seem unreliable.

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.399
Especially Xu Dacheng.

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:02.560
He's downright shady and
his methods are underhanded.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.919
So we're the ones who raised the child,

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:06.200
and now we're the ones

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:08.960
in the wrong,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.159
like we'd done something terrible.

00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:14.200
My poor girl...
If we'd sent her back to them...

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:14.890
You're home, Mingzhu.

00:08:14.893 --> 00:08:18.830
They favored boys over girls...
Could she have had a good life?

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.660
- That's enough.
- Mom...

00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:21.315
Now 30 years have passed,

00:08:21.315 --> 00:08:23.000
our life is better,
and she comes to steal my daughter away!

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.039
Your daughter is back.

00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:25.589
How do you think it'll make her feel

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.137
by saying all these in front of her?

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:28.960
Mom, please stop crying.

00:08:31.799 --> 00:08:33.560
It's just so unfair!

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.759
Alright, don't cry.

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:37.320
Mom.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.960
No matter what happens,

00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:42.160
you're my only mother.

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:45.359
I'm just so afraid

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.040
she'll steal you away.

00:08:47.071 --> 00:08:49.360
How am I going to live then?

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.019
Your daughter is right here, isn't she?

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:51.839
What are you talking about?

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.560
I'm an adult now.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.280
How will I get stolen away?

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.639
I only have one mother.

00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:58.560
And that's you.

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:03.599
Stop crying now.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.440
Here, have some more water.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.560
Let me take it.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.719
Sweetheart, I...

00:09:25.359 --> 00:09:27.800
I was really irrational today.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.839
It's okay.

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:30.479
I know.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.719
They want to get close to me so badly

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.680
probably because they
feel they owe me so much.

00:09:42.239 --> 00:09:43.040
You see,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.680
Zhixia helped promote our hotel,

00:09:46.479 --> 00:09:48.119
which is how I got my double bonus.

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:50.800
Her mother only drops by

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.560
with some eggs or braised beef.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.920
She's never said anything inappropriate.

00:09:56.359 --> 00:09:57.239
Even her brother

00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:59.879
booked his wedding banquet at our hotel

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:02.519
just to support my work.

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:05.719
They've all been so nice.

00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:08.599
I can't just give them

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.879
the cold shoulder, right?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.119
I know.

00:10:13.119 --> 00:10:15.560
It's just

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.280
basic manners,

00:10:17.479 --> 00:10:18.719
even with strangers.

00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:19.800
That's just good manners.

00:10:20.359 --> 00:10:21.119
And besides,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.560
it's not like we're short on money.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.719
This bangle alone cost
over a hundred thousand, right?

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.359
It's getting late. You should head back.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.320
Minghui,

00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:36.200
take your sister home.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:36.800
Now.

00:10:36.848 --> 00:10:38.440
- Get some rest.
- I'm going now.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:38.879
I'm okay.

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:39.960
Get some rest.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.759
Mingzhu,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.080
what if the Xu family insists
on claiming you?

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:58.839
Honestly,

00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:00.599
I don't know either.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.080
I don't know how to face them.

00:11:03.515 --> 00:11:06.048
Sometimes, when I think about it,
I feel so much resentment.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:06.839
How could

00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:08.719
they just give away their child?

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:12.639
But then when I see how hard
they're trying to reach out,

00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:13.519
to make up for it,

00:11:13.871 --> 00:11:15.230
I can't help but soften a little.

00:11:16.239 --> 00:11:17.119
Part of me thinks

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:19.999
maybe they really
had no choice back then.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.160
Blood ties are strange like that.

00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:28.239
That's not fair.

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:29.440
It's cheating.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.479
You know,

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:46.080
when you were still in Mom's belly,

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.204
I used to read
"Journey to the West" to you.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.560
You'd kick my palm

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.759
through her stomach.

00:11:52.239 --> 00:11:52.960
Whenever I said,

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.560
"Here comes the Monkey King",

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.239
bam, one kick.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.599
Then I'd say,

00:11:57.599 --> 00:11:58.599
"Here comes Pigsy!"

00:11:58.599 --> 00:12:00.280
Bam, another one.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.519
It was so fun.

00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:05.359
Later, when you were born
and wouldn't stop crying,

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.271
Mom and Dad couldn't calm you down.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.879
I'd pick you up and say,

00:12:08.879 --> 00:12:09.920
"The Monkey King is here",

00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:11.879
and you'd stop crying right away.

00:12:11.915 --> 00:12:13.693
No wonder "Journey to the West"

00:12:13.693 --> 00:12:14.937
was always my best subject.

00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:18.800
So no matter what happens,

00:12:19.719 --> 00:12:21.119
blood or no blood,

00:12:22.359 --> 00:12:24.440
we're family, for real.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.479
I told Mom today

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.400
she'll always be my mother.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.080
And you,

00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:33.400
you'll always be my little brother.

00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:35.320
Exactly!

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:38.239
People even say we look alike.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.200
We're practically real brothers.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.680
Brothers?

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.040
We're brother and sister.

00:12:44.719 --> 00:12:46.479
And I don't think we look alike at all.

00:12:46.479 --> 00:12:48.160
Aw, come on, don't look down on me.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.320
When the baby grows up,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.250
I'm going to tell him
"Journey to the West" too.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.359
Go on, tell it right now.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.200
So,

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:58.599
once upon a time, there was
a monkey named Monkey King.

00:12:59.359 --> 00:13:00.280
And a pig,

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:01.839
you know his name?

00:13:01.879 --> 00:13:02.599
Pigsy.

00:13:02.839 --> 00:13:04.119
No, it's Shen Mingzhu.

00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:05.879
You're the pig!

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.200
Do you know who Xuanzang is?

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:09.519
Xuanzang is Yue Xiu'e.

00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:11.960
She nags all day long.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.639
And Sandy, that's Shen Shengli.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.719
His whole job is to go buy groceries,

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.479
carry the loads,

00:13:18.479 --> 00:13:19.599
and chop the vegetables.

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:21.639
What are you then?

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.280
Me?

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:24.320
I'm the White Dragon Horse!

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.519
Seriously?

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:28.359
I'm going to carry you all on my back.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.639
And your baby...

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.239
The baby...

00:13:34.239 --> 00:13:35.560
The baby is...

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.999
The Spider Demon.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.759
(Good luck on
the college entrance exams.)

00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:53.599
Revenue...

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.320
72,000.

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:01.400
Gross profit, 0.4.

00:14:03.999 --> 00:14:06.040
Four times seven is 28.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:09.960
Still too little.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.999
Shen Minghui, what are you doing?

00:14:17.537 --> 00:14:18.800
I'm checking my calculations.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.759
A restaurant.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.400
Revenue of 72,000.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.639
A gross profit of 40%.

00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:38.560
Stand up!

00:14:39.115 --> 00:14:40.470
You're calculating profit margins?

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.440
Isn't the whole point of math
to apply it to real calculations?

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.560
You said that yourself, Mr. Sun.

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:48.359
Fine.

00:14:49.239 --> 00:14:50.960
Tell your parents to come
see me tomorrow.

00:14:51.479 --> 00:14:52.519
I said that too.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.440
My guardian can't come.

00:14:57.479 --> 00:14:58.280
Why?

00:14:59.048 --> 00:15:01.110
My brother-in-law is the one
who tutors me at home.

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:03.960
Lately, he's...

00:15:05.359 --> 00:15:06.119
On a business trip?

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.879
Or is he sick?

00:15:08.479 --> 00:15:09.320
I can wait.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.719
He's dead.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400
Shen Minghui,

00:15:17.999 --> 00:15:19.839
how can you curse your family like that?

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.239
Poor grades are one thing,

00:15:23.239 --> 00:15:24.519
that's an ability problem.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.630
But making up lies like
this is a character problem.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.448
Do you understand?

00:15:27.599 --> 00:15:28.359
Mr. Sun,

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.599
he's telling the truth.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.519
His brother-in-law was the man

00:15:32.519 --> 00:15:34.400
who saved that drowning
child in Nanzhou River.

00:15:35.582 --> 00:15:36.870
You can look it up online.

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:38.119
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:15:43.719 --> 00:15:44.320
Minghui,

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.119
I'm sorry.

00:15:45.719 --> 00:15:46.719
I blamed you wrongly.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.359
Come on, sit.

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:49.839
It's okay, Mr. Sun.

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:57.239
No wonder your focus
has been off lately.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.639
I had no idea your family passed.

00:16:00.982 --> 00:16:01.920
Here's what we'll do.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:03.960
Come to the office

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:05.639
every day at noon.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.204
I'll give you some extra tutoring.

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:08.239
Let's work on

00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:10.479
getting your grades up.

00:16:16.315 --> 00:16:18.026
I'd rather you called my guardian.

00:16:19.239 --> 00:16:20.080
What was that?

00:16:21.599 --> 00:16:22.999
I said, thank you, Mr. Sun.

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:27.119
Lu Bing,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.759
please hand these out.

00:16:31.719 --> 00:16:32.400
Minghui,

00:16:33.719 --> 00:16:35.400
come to the office at noon today.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.479
I'll help you.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.500
(Teacher's Office)

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.879
Mr. Sun,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.879
when are we going to the cafeteria?

00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:01.400
If you don't go soon,

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.626
there won't be any food left.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.848
We'll go in a little while.

00:17:06.071 --> 00:17:07.848
You get sleepy
if you eat on a full stomach.

00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:10.279
How about this, finish this problem,

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:11.200
and then we'll go.

00:17:12.759 --> 00:17:13.400
Mr. Sun,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.479
have you eaten?

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:15.239
No.

00:17:15.804 --> 00:17:17.360
The line is too long right now.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:24.960
Shen Minghui,

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:26.640
did you understand

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.279
what I just explained to you?

00:17:28.759 --> 00:17:29.640
Yes.

00:17:30.026 --> 00:17:31.893
Then why did you
still answer it like this?

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:39.559
Shen Minghui,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.799
I'm friends with your sister.

00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:44.799
If you ever have any
questions about physics,

00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:46.079
you can come to me.

00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:50.640
Mr. Hu.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.200
I need to ask you something.

00:17:57.719 --> 00:17:59.640
Do you know about his brother-in-law?

00:18:01.239 --> 00:18:02.120
I do.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.039
My girlfriend is his
brother-in-law's little sister.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.200
So you're relatives.

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.400
Soon-to-be relatives.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.640
Excuse me.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.880
Hello, Meiqi.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.519
I just finished class.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.559
I'm coming.

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:26.120
Wait for me.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.079
I'm leaving, Mr. Sun.

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:29.640
Bye.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.719
Look, Shen Minghui,

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.600
I'll starve with you.

00:18:39.999 --> 00:18:41.079
Neither of us is eating

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.471
until you finish this problem.

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:46.319
Let's eat.

00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:48.519
Maybe we should wait for Hu Gang.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.400
It's fine. We can eat without him.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.759
Don't you have
a wedding dress fitting later?

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.960
I'm not in a hurry.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.600
Well, I'm starving. I'm eating.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.279
Hu Gang isn't even coming for the food.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.471
He's just upgrading the software
on my computer.

00:19:02.239 --> 00:19:04.160
The perks of dating a tech guy.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.680
He could be a bit awkward, but...

00:19:07.319 --> 00:19:09.319
"A bit"? Try very.

00:19:09.319 --> 00:19:10.880
Very, very awkward, okay?

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.239
You can work on molding him a little.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.120
Everyone's got their own personality.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:16.880
That's normal.

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:18.239
Besides,

00:19:18.382 --> 00:19:19.840
it's not like I'm marrying Hu Gang.

00:19:20.248 --> 00:19:21.960
I don't even really want to get married.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.426
So why would I try to change him?

00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:25.559
What is he to you then?

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:26.400
A shield.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.360
To block my countless aunts

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.115
and their overwhelming
matchmaking urges.

00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:33.360
And Hu Gang has a great temper.

00:19:33.559 --> 00:19:35.640
He can handle all my negative emotions.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.440
But...

00:19:38.239 --> 00:19:40.400
isn't that a little unfair to him?

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:41.880
He doesn't mind.

00:19:49.079 --> 00:19:49.680
Meiqi.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.559
Sit.

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:51.319
Hi, Bichen.

00:19:51.337 --> 00:19:53.440
Sorry, we were starving,
so we started without you.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.648
No, it's my fault for
getting out of class so late.

00:19:56.319 --> 00:19:56.920
Excuse me,

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.920
we'd like a menu.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.479
Okay.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.559
Thank you.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.719
Mr. Hu.

00:20:03.479 --> 00:20:04.519
I can't finish it.

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:05.880
Could you finish it for me?

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.880
Of course.

00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:08.759
I'm not ordering.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.680
I'll just eat yours.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.279
Thank you.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.279
Have some fruits.

00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:23.719
Is it good?

00:20:24.239 --> 00:20:24.880
Yes.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.120
The cafeteria food's getting worse.

00:20:30.293 --> 00:20:32.382
If you come late, there's
not even anything left.

00:20:32.426 --> 00:20:34.440
Just bear with it. We'll graduate soon.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.950
Look, there's someone in their fifth
year of high school still eating here.

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.999
Don't say that. I repeated a year too.

00:20:39.999 --> 00:20:40.559
Hi, Lu Bing.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.680
Hi, Mr. Sun.

00:20:44.519 --> 00:20:45.279
Just eating now?

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.279
Mr. Sun,

00:20:47.759 --> 00:20:48.360
I told you.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.960
If you come late, there's no food left.

00:20:50.239 --> 00:20:51.120
Look at Lu Bing,

00:20:51.182 --> 00:20:53.848
she's our star student aiming
for Tsinghua or Peking University!

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.982
How is she supposed to get
proper nutrition eating so little?

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.826
Aren't you going to do
something about this?

00:21:02.279 --> 00:21:03.079
No dishes left?

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.360
This is all that's left.

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:05.799
Is this enough?

00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:06.880
You guys can't be serious.

00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:09.400
These kids are still growing,

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.920
especially the seniors,

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.400
right in the middle of exam prep!

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.440
Can't you just make a little more?

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.239
So...

00:21:19.719 --> 00:21:20.799
Come early next time.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:22.920
Go eat now.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:23.893
See you around, Mr. Sun.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.840
Stop looking. Let's get the food.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.319
There's nothing to eat.

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:34.160
So, please put some gravy on our rice.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.200
Meiqi, you have a good eye.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.715
What do you think of this one?

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:51.789
Bichen,

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.715
do they have something
a bit more understated?

00:21:53.737 --> 00:21:55.230
This one feels a little heavy to me.

00:21:57.319 --> 00:21:59.039
Alright, I'll take another look.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.400
What did she say?

00:22:01.319 --> 00:22:02.960
She said it seemed too heavy.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.160
No, it doesn't.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.039
It seems alright to me.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.880
Yes, I agree.

00:22:08.915 --> 00:22:10.640
Actually, the one
you're wearing right now

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.559
looks great.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.039
It's a designer piece

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:14.120
with an excellent cut.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:14.600
Really?

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.120
All the lace is hand-woven.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.310
Take a look at the detailing.

00:22:17.319 --> 00:22:18.640
How much is this one?

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.319
If you order today, it's 11,000 yuan

00:22:20.319 --> 00:22:21.360
for the set of three.

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:24.440
You can mix and match
between the ceremony gown,

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.671
the traditional wedding dress,
and the reception dress.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.200
Okay.

00:22:28.999 --> 00:22:30.200
Let's take all three then.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.559
No rush. We'll think about it first.

00:22:32.759 --> 00:22:33.039
Sure.

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:33.759
Thank you.

00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:36.319
Let's go.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.479
Mom.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.360
You're home.

00:22:54.079 --> 00:22:55.160
Why are you eating that?

00:22:56.079 --> 00:22:56.999
I'm not very hungry.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.519
This is fine.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.920
Let me cook something for you.
You haven't eaten.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.759
I ate.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.160
I had lunch with Chen.

00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:04.920
Alright.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.640
Where's Dad?

00:23:06.999 --> 00:23:07.600
He's dead.

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:08.640
Who died?

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.400
Dad.

00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:18.200
Where's my lunch?

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:22.079
Yu Jingxiang, where's my lunch?

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:23.999
I'm your enemy's daughter.

00:23:24.226 --> 00:23:26.070
Aren't you worried
I might poison your food?

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:27.920
You're crazy.

00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:31.640
You're crazy one.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.160
Mom.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.360
So...

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.079
Chen's parents asked me today

00:23:47.079 --> 00:23:49.079
about our plan for the wedding.

00:23:49.315 --> 00:23:50.782
Like how many guests we're inviting.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.600
What should I tell them?

00:23:56.279 --> 00:23:56.960
Oh...

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.279
You know what?
You should go ask your dad.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.880
This is too hard.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.360
Meat...

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.880
Pork belly...

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.640
Rice...

00:24:38.279 --> 00:24:39.120
I'm starving.

00:24:40.519 --> 00:24:41.120
Come on.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.600
More meat.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.239
More pork belly.

00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:49.440
I'm starving.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:08.999
Zhidong!

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.039
Zhidong!

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.782
- I'm here.
- Breakfast's ready!

00:25:14.759 --> 00:25:15.319
Mom,

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.319
it's not just plain boiled eggs today?

00:25:18.319 --> 00:25:19.559
This is a feast.

00:25:24.337 --> 00:25:25.920
Here, have it with this side dish.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.319
Eat slowly!

00:25:28.479 --> 00:25:30.319
You'll choke.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.920
So, how did it go yesterday with Bichen,

00:25:33.426 --> 00:25:34.790
trying on the wedding dresses?

00:25:35.479 --> 00:25:36.559
How was it?

00:25:37.382 --> 00:25:39.315
We checked out three dresses,
and they were nice.

00:25:39.319 --> 00:25:41.079
But Bichen thought
they were a bit pricey.

00:25:41.093 --> 00:25:42.782
She said she wanted to look online.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.880
You know, Bichen...

00:25:49.999 --> 00:25:51.079
She's a nice girl.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:51.680
Yeah.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.750
You couldn't find another
like her even if you tried.

00:25:56.319 --> 00:25:56.920
Dad,

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.160
look, Mom specially made you

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.680
a whole table of breakfast.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.999
Come on, sit down and have some.

00:26:03.999 --> 00:26:04.880
I'm not eating.

00:26:07.759 --> 00:26:08.559
Mom.

00:26:10.093 --> 00:26:11.070
That's just how Dad is.

00:26:11.079 --> 00:26:12.160
Leave him be.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.201
I'll finish it.

00:26:14.519 --> 00:26:16.880
Forget it then! So annoying.

00:26:19.093 --> 00:26:20.400
And what about the bride price?

00:26:20.493 --> 00:26:22.204
When are we going to give it to them?

00:26:22.226 --> 00:26:24.293
I feel like Bichen's parents
are getting upset.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.319
Xu Zhidong,

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.680
do you have no sense of timing?

00:26:32.079 --> 00:26:33.880
With Xu Dacheng acting like this,

00:26:34.519 --> 00:26:35.680
if we visit them now,

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.200
we'll just make fools of ourselves.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.160
When will you stop this
silent treatment then?

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.559
Hi, Chen.

00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:49.999
Zhidong, we've set the wedding date.

00:26:50.239 --> 00:26:52.880
Have you talked to your mom
about the wedding?

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.640
I'm discussing with them right now.

00:26:58.319 --> 00:26:59.600
I'll call you back later.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.880
(Zhidong)

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.559
Zhixia.

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:11.920
Talk.

00:27:13.115 --> 00:27:15.426
Our parents are giving each
other the silent treatment,

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.719
Bichen's parents

00:27:16.719 --> 00:27:18.479
keep asking about the bride price,

00:27:18.479 --> 00:27:19.279
and on top of that,

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.519
we haven't booked a venue.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.239
I really don't know what to do.

00:27:24.239 --> 00:27:25.840
What am I supposed to tell Bichen?

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.840
Could you stop being so dramatic?

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.759
I'm pregnant, remember?

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.120
I know, but I'm out of options,

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:32.680
Zhixia.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.640
How about I come pick you up?

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.039
I'll carry you back if I have to.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.239
Xu Zhidong,

00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:39.880
even if you carried me
back on a sedan chair,

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.279
I'm still not going.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.519
Dad, Mom,

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.719
I brought you medicine!

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.920
What medicine?

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.920
You could've just brought it in.

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:04.160
Xiang!

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:06.799
Xiang!

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.360
What do you want?

00:28:18.999 --> 00:28:19.719
Mingzhu?

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.840
Mingzhu!

00:28:23.479 --> 00:28:23.960
Mingzhu!

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.400
Careful!

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:24.999
Mingzhu,

00:28:25.279 --> 00:28:26.120
you're here.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.160
- Come inside.
- Come in.

00:28:29.319 --> 00:28:30.279
Come inside.

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:31.079
Come on.

00:28:31.079 --> 00:28:31.799
Come.

00:28:31.799 --> 00:28:32.840
What are you doing here?

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.920
Come in.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:34.759
Come on.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.200
Come.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.600
Sit.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.479
Here.

00:28:39.493 --> 00:28:40.310
The place is a mess.

00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:41.079
Yes.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.519
- It's okay.
- Come.

00:28:42.519 --> 00:28:43.279
Let her sit down.

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:44.360
Come on, girl.

00:28:44.479 --> 00:28:45.319
Sit here.

00:28:45.319 --> 00:28:45.999
Sit down.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:46.759
Sit.

00:28:46.759 --> 00:28:47.999
Come, sit down.

00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:51.920
You can look around.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.239
So,

00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:05.120
Zhidong is holding the wedding
at our Nanxi Hotel.

00:29:05.239 --> 00:29:06.640
I brought the menu today

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.559
for you to look over.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.840
Sure, sure.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.270
I managed to get an approval
from the hotel for a 12% discount.

00:29:11.271 --> 00:29:12.550
Oh, no need for a discount!

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:13.200
That's not necessary.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.239
Dad, it's the hotel giving the discount.

00:29:15.239 --> 00:29:17.279
Mingzhu isn't paying out
of her own pocket, okay?

00:29:17.719 --> 00:29:18.200
That's good.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.319
You're amazing.

00:29:19.319 --> 00:29:20.440
Yes, you're awesome.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.319
So awesome.

00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:22.239
That's right.

00:29:22.239 --> 00:29:22.799
Yes.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.360
Mingzhu.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:25.799
Thank you.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.279
You're welcome.

00:29:29.079 --> 00:29:29.680
Mom.

00:29:30.079 --> 00:29:31.640
Mingzhu brought you something.

00:29:32.319 --> 00:29:32.960
What thing?

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.479
Yes.

00:29:34.079 --> 00:29:35.719
I brought you something.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.319
You...

00:29:37.719 --> 00:29:38.600
Mingzhu,

00:29:39.239 --> 00:29:41.200
we're happy enough

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.640
that you came visit.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.759
You really didn't have to.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.960
You talked to the hotel for us,

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.400
and got us a discount.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.600
We're supposed to be giving you gifts.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.840
That's right, we should.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.400
Yes.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.759
No, you misunderstood.

00:29:53.999 --> 00:29:56.079
This is actually from my mom.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.799
About what happened that day,

00:29:57.999 --> 00:30:00.039
she realized she went too far
after she got home.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.920
So, she thought she should give you
some supplements for your health.

00:30:06.479 --> 00:30:07.039
Okay.

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:09.960
Mingzhu,

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.519
are you thirsty?

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.440
Are you hungry?

00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:14.440
I'll make you some tea.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.120
- Why are you sitting there?
- Make her something to drink.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.160
Go make some tea.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.559
I'll get you something to drink.

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:20.600
Please wait here.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.204
I'm going to get you some food.

00:30:22.204 --> 00:30:22.750
Wait here.

00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:24.400
Don't eat it on your own.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:24.920
Here.

00:30:25.239 --> 00:30:26.799
Mingzhu, try this.

00:30:27.319 --> 00:30:28.559
Let's see.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.680
Jealous?

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.239
Feeling unfair?

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.880
I'm used to it.

00:30:34.039 --> 00:30:34.719
Mingzhu,

00:30:35.048 --> 00:30:36.110
this happens all the time.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.559
Move.

00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:38.400
Legs up.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.559
Here.

00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:41.920
Try these dates.

00:30:43.479 --> 00:30:44.200
What is this?

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.039
You can't eat this.

00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:46.440
Move, move.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.120
Mingzhu,

00:30:48.239 --> 00:30:50.039
our fruits aren't fresh enough.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.279
I'll just peel you a cucumber.

00:30:52.799 --> 00:30:53.360
This won't do.

00:30:54.799 --> 00:30:56.079
Go buy some fruits.

00:30:56.079 --> 00:30:57.050
The most expensive ones.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.600
It's really fine. You don't have to.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.559
Mingzhu,

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.920
just leave them be.

00:31:01.079 --> 00:31:01.880
See? I told you.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.004
You're the miracle cure.

00:31:03.048 --> 00:31:04.120
You fixed them right up.

00:31:04.239 --> 00:31:05.559
You instantly turned two old folks

00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:08.120
ready to tear each other's hair out

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.559
into a picture of marital bliss.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.559
Xu Zhidong and I

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:13.719
are no match for you.

00:31:16.039 --> 00:31:17.239
Let's open this up.

00:31:17.239 --> 00:31:17.640
Okay.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.880
Here, try it.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.239
Yes, this one.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.680
She must be hungry.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.920
Let her try it one by one.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.400
Look at you.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.799
Here, open up.

00:31:27.871 --> 00:31:28.880
You don't like sweet food?

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.440
Mom,

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:31.120
I'm hungry too.

00:31:31.479 --> 00:31:32.960
There are steamed buns in the fridge.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.880
Go get them yourself.

00:31:34.048 --> 00:31:35.840
You want to drink this?
I'll open it for you.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.719
But is cold drink okay?

00:31:36.719 --> 00:31:38.200
It's okay. I got this.

00:31:38.279 --> 00:31:39.039
It's cold.

00:31:43.079 --> 00:31:44.120
Honestly,

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.239
our banquet hall

00:31:45.239 --> 00:31:46.519
is indeed a bit dated.

00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:48.719
I've asked management before

00:31:48.719 --> 00:31:49.840
about renovating it,

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.799
but they didn't agree.

00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:53.519
Why didn't they agree?

00:31:54.759 --> 00:31:55.440
No budget.

00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:57.319
Just like us.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.920
I have a good friend
who works in wedding planning.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.880
She's amazing.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.826
She can turn old into vintage,
designing all kinds of retro themes.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.960
Here, take a look at these mock-ups.

00:32:09.448 --> 00:32:10.550
This one's Hong Kong–style,

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.920
this one's Republic-era,

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.600
and this one's 1980s retro.

00:32:16.239 --> 00:32:17.479
See which one you like.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.719
They're all pretty cool.

00:32:19.719 --> 00:32:20.319
Yes.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.710
Which one do you like best?

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.799
I think

00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:25.759
I like the Republic-era theme.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.279
It feels so elegant.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.310
Lijun Hotel doesn't have
this kind of vibe.

00:32:29.759 --> 00:32:31.160
You checked out Lijun?

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:31.960
Yes.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.360
It was 8,888 yuan per table.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.693
That's just the starting price.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.079
Honestly,

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.440
Lijun is fancier than our place.

00:32:39.782 --> 00:32:41.840
River view, grand dome ceiling,
really impressive.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.079
My sister-in-law actually works there.

00:32:44.093 --> 00:32:45.640
What's your sister-in-law's name?

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.640
Feng Meiqi.

00:32:47.479 --> 00:32:48.319
Really?

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.440
What a small world!

00:32:51.079 --> 00:32:52.559
She's my closest high school friend.

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:53.799
I'm going to video call her now.

00:32:53.826 --> 00:32:54.510
That's not necessary.

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:55.279
It's fine.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.079
Meiqi,

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.479
look who this is.

00:32:59.479 --> 00:33:00.239
Hi, Meiqi.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.479
Mingzhu?

00:33:02.719 --> 00:33:03.920
What are you doing together?

00:33:05.479 --> 00:33:06.920
I'm introducing them

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.279
our hotel's wedding hall.

00:33:08.719 --> 00:33:10.479
Sorry for snatching your client.

00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:11.960
It's fine.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.279
Nanxi Hotel is more economical.

00:33:15.479 --> 00:33:18.239
Yes, because we can't afford Lijun.

00:33:19.519 --> 00:33:20.200
By the way,

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.440
did you know that Mingzhu

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.160
is my boyfriend's long-lost sister?

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:25.960
Really?

00:33:27.039 --> 00:33:28.920
Mingzhu, you found your birth parents?

00:33:31.319 --> 00:33:32.719
It just happened recently.

00:33:33.079 --> 00:33:34.640
Why didn't you tell us?

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.960
I haven't had the chance.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.640
Meiqi,

00:33:39.799 --> 00:33:41.360
let me show you the other venue options.

00:33:43.479 --> 00:33:44.960
Did we cause you trouble?

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.200
No. It's fine.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.479
Oh, no.

00:33:48.479 --> 00:33:49.960
Oh, no, this is bad.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.279
Really bad.

00:33:53.239 --> 00:33:55.960
Shen Mingzhu suddenly
has two new parents,

00:33:56.279 --> 00:33:58.680
an older sister, and a little brother.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.759
And they are just ordinary folks,

00:34:00.759 --> 00:34:02.239
no money, no status, no resources.

00:34:02.239 --> 00:34:03.479
They can't help with anything.

00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:09.199
What if one day they expect us

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.240
to use our connections for them?

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.280
Come on, it's not that serious.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:14.920
Don't

00:34:14.999 --> 00:34:17.079
work yourself up over things

00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:18.119
that haven't even happened.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.159
Dad's right.

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:22.840
I simply shared that to you as a gossip.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.079
And you're overreacting.

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.679
I won't tell you anything next time.

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:26.479
Feng Meiqi,

00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:28.800
you're too young and naive.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.760
You don't understand.

00:34:29.871 --> 00:34:31.150
And you, why are you laughing?

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:31.880
You're no better,

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.159
never care about anything!

00:34:33.479 --> 00:34:34.479
I'm telling you both,

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.760
this is serious.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.639
Shen Mingzhu didn't
even tell us about this.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.559
Do you know what that means?

00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:44.760
What does it mean?

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.240
It means Shen Mingzhu's loyalty

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.240
is wavering.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.960
It means

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.960
she doesn't see us as her own family.

00:35:00.679 --> 00:35:01.760
I regret it now.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.599
I never should've given her

00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:06.639
that heirloom bracelet so early.

00:35:07.479 --> 00:35:09.320
Yes, you should've
given it to me instead.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:09.880
That's enough.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.599
Don't butt in.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.679
What's done is done.

00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:17.479
And anyway,

00:35:17.479 --> 00:35:19.159
even if Mingzhu's feelings are divided,

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.079
she's still carrying

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.119
our family's grandchild, isn't she?

00:35:23.519 --> 00:35:26.320
Precisely because
she's carrying our grandchild,

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.800
she must stay absolutely loyal to us.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.079
Oh my god, Mom,

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:32.800
you can control everything
but not someone's heart.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.360
That's right.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.426
What do you mean by that?

00:35:35.293 --> 00:35:36.070
What does that mean?

00:35:36.119 --> 00:35:38.020
Does Shen Mingzhu
have something else going on

00:35:38.026 --> 00:35:39.471
that you're not telling me? Tell me!

00:35:39.479 --> 00:35:40.479
Nothing.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.070
You're being irrational.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.604
I'm not telling you anything anymore.

00:35:43.679 --> 00:35:44.639
Oh no, listen now,

00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:45.760
you're telling me everything.

00:35:46.199 --> 00:35:48.559
From now on, any little sign,

00:35:48.559 --> 00:35:50.629
rumor, or whisper,
you report it to me immediately.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.493
That's called prevention
before trouble starts!

00:35:53.604 --> 00:35:54.804
I'm going to take a bath.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.440
Feng.

00:35:59.159 --> 00:35:59.800
Feng.

00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:01.360
I'm coming now.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:01.960
Right over.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.920
Something has come up at the factory.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.720
I have to be there.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.760
At this hour?

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.720
What came up?

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.479
Where are you going?

00:36:07.479 --> 00:36:08.679
The factory.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:22.880
Mingzhu.

00:36:24.479 --> 00:36:25.119
Mom?

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.800
You're still awake?

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.110
I was waiting for you.

00:36:30.479 --> 00:36:31.320
Me?

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.679
I heard

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.800
you found your birth parents.

00:36:40.559 --> 00:36:41.240
Yes.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.960
Why didn't you tell us?

00:36:46.199 --> 00:36:48.079
It happened just a few days ago.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.639
I haven't had the chance.

00:36:50.599 --> 00:36:51.720
We see each other everyday,

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.240
morning and night.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.604
You haven't had the chance?

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:55.840
I don't think so.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.880
Did you not want to tell me?

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.070
Do you really see this place
as your home?

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.800
Do you really see us as your family?

00:37:07.639 --> 00:37:08.479
Actually,

00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:11.119
this relationship is too complicated.

00:37:11.604 --> 00:37:13.440
I haven't figured out
how to deal with it.

00:37:13.515 --> 00:37:15.293
That's why I didn't say anything.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.360
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.079
If it's complicated,

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.280
stay away from them then.

00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:24.639
Your emotions could affect the baby.

00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:26.800
You got it?

00:37:28.159 --> 00:37:29.199
Also, Mingzhu,

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.079
if you encounter any trouble again,

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:33.479
you have to tell us.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.400
We'll help you.

00:37:37.248 --> 00:37:38.840
I've made you some white fungus soup.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.880
It's on the coffee table.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.290
Have some before you go to sleep.

00:37:41.293 --> 00:37:42.182
Thanks, Mom.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280
I'm going back then.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.159
Go on.

00:37:44.159 --> 00:37:45.479
Okay, good night.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.220
(Shen's Restaurant)

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.639
Hurry up!

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.920
I'm coming!

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:01.960
I'm here.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.679
Dacheng.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:05.880
Dacheng!

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.320
Check this out.

00:39:08.337 --> 00:39:09.720
Our daughter bought it for me.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.800
Looks nice, right?

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:14.599
This is family heirloom.

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:15.760
It's from my mother-in-law.

00:39:16.519 --> 00:39:18.199
You should wear it all the time.

00:39:18.199 --> 00:39:19.920
No way. It's a family heirloom.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.280
You know, my husband looks so handsome.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.999
Alright, everything's ready.

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:29.599
Let's go.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.920
Zhidong!

00:39:32.479 --> 00:39:33.400
Zhidong!

00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:35.720
- Coming!
- It's time to go!

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.479
Mom, you forgot the ginseng!

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.479
You're the one who should carry it!

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.400
We're going to Bichen's house!
Why are you dawdling?

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:42.960
Mom,

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.960
is the bride price all ready?

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.639
The bride price

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.679
is all in the bank.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.004
I thought we were giving it
to them today?

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.039
Zhidong,

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.240
here's the thing,

00:39:58.479 --> 00:40:00.199
I'll explain it clearly

00:40:00.199 --> 00:40:01.400
to Bichen's parents.

00:40:02.479 --> 00:40:03.920
We'll give the bride price

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.800
to the bride

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.079
on the wedding eve party.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.920
You just tell them

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:12.360
it's an old tradition from our hometown.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.280
An old custom.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.440
Dad,

00:40:15.199 --> 00:40:16.440
what wedding eve party?

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.493
Do we have such a custom?

00:40:18.159 --> 00:40:18.920
Your mom

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.079
is clearly joking.

00:40:20.479 --> 00:40:21.240
Fine, fine.

00:40:21.639 --> 00:40:22.479
Xu Dacheng,

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.880
200,000 is not a small amount.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.119
I know, I know.

00:40:27.479 --> 00:40:28.079
Zhidong,

00:40:28.479 --> 00:40:30.599
mine and your father's life savings

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:31.669
are in there,

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.337
plus your sister's 100,000!

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.440
And I'm eternally grateful.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.537
Besides, just in case...

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.720
I'm just saying in case,

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.400
things don't work out
with you and Bichen...

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.280
That's impossible.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.720
I know it's impossible!

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.240
I'm just talking about a "what if",

00:40:43.679 --> 00:40:44.320
right?

00:40:45.915 --> 00:40:48.550
It's much harder to get money
back than it is to give it away.

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:50.159
Alright, don't worry.

00:40:50.479 --> 00:40:51.840
Your mother knows what she's doing.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.599
Okay.

00:40:52.648 --> 00:40:53.630
Just wish me the best.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.629
Alright!

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:55.537
Off to buy groceries?

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.240
You're all dressed so formally.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.440
Where are you going?

00:41:00.599 --> 00:41:01.920
Paying a visit to the in-laws!

00:41:02.599 --> 00:41:03.320
Zhidong,

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.320
when's the wedding banquet?

00:41:05.337 --> 00:41:07.440
Soon, Madam Zheng. I'll send you
an invitation when it's time.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.639
Alright, I'll be waiting!

00:41:08.639 --> 00:41:11.199
A son's wedding will
be the death of his father!

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.960
But it's a happy occasion!

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.320
The exhaustion is worth it!

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.920
That's right.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.639
Easy there.

00:41:16.639 --> 00:41:17.479
Careful.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.119
I got in.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.240
Alright!

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:29.300
(Nanzhou First People's Hospital)

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.960
The test results are good.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.937
Nothing to worry about.

00:41:32.004 --> 00:41:34.004
I've been busy planning
a wedding banquet lately.

00:41:34.004 --> 00:41:34.960
Strangely, keeping busy

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.559
has helped me eat and sleep better.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.226
Because you're
keeping yourself occupied.

00:41:38.248 --> 00:41:39.620
But still, don't overwork yourself.

00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:42.440
By the way, I wanted
to ask you something.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.280
My uncle is turning 70 next month.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.115
Does Nanxi Hotel
handle birthday banquets?

00:41:46.137 --> 00:41:47.093
Of course we do!

00:41:47.226 --> 00:41:49.320
If you book with us,
I'll get a discount for you.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.693
Great, I'll let the family know.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.880
I'll visit your hotel this weekend
to take a look first.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.960
Sure, no problem.

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.400
Just call me before you come.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.199
Sure.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:56.920
I'm done.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:57.720
Take care.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.400
Bye.

00:41:58.679 --> 00:41:59.199
Come in.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.519
Look at their building.

00:42:02.679 --> 00:42:03.240
Come.

00:42:03.582 --> 00:42:04.280
Give it to me.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.119
Here.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.039
Hold it.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.720
There's another one here.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:10.280
Come.

00:42:10.537 --> 00:42:11.320
Let me get off this.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:11.920
Easy there.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.720
Give your mom a hand.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.559
I got this.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.679
I got this.

00:42:16.599 --> 00:42:17.760
I'll carry some.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:19.840
This neighborhood...

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.920
Bichen's neighborhood is also

00:42:22.199 --> 00:42:23.840
such a mess.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.360
It's not like you live in a mansion.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.720
Why are you picking on them?

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.280
Hear that?

00:42:28.519 --> 00:42:29.880
Dad has got a point.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.280
You're always

00:42:33.519 --> 00:42:34.599
sticking together.

00:42:34.715 --> 00:42:36.110
- Mr and Mrs. Xu!
- Hi, Bichen!

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:36.880
Chen.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.804
- Bichen!
- Mrs. Xu.

00:42:37.999 --> 00:42:38.720
Bichen.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.871
Let me carry that for you.

00:42:39.915 --> 00:42:41.360
- I got this.
- It's okay.
