Lu Lingfeng.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.430
Are you really under imperial orders

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.950
to search for the auspicious beast?

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.759
Why does it look like

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.350
you're taking your whole family

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.870
on a sightseeing trip?

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.840
Who are you?

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.300

to Mount Zhongnan.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.240
It's a heavy responsibility.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.150
I will do my utmost to find Bai Ze.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.150
Miss Pei…

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.750
Miss Pei is skilled in painting.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.680
After entering the mountains…

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.480
I understand.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.870
But the journey
is too arduous and difficult.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.960
If you wear yourself out,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.750
how will I explain it to Minister Pei?

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.630
Just stay.

last night.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.750
You have to treat me.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.680
That acupuncture of yours

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.520
works pretty well.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.470
How about I treat you after we return

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.520
from Mount Zhongnan?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.320
That won't do.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.400
It hurts so much.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.130
I can't wait.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.120
Madam Yingtao's martial skills
are impressive.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.320
I've witnessed them.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.400
But this journey
is on behalf of His Majesty

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.360
to find Bai Ze.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.190

travel by day, and camp by night.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.160
It's not convenient for a woman.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.560
And you, boy,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.710
why are you tagging along?

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.030
I'm going to protect my master!

If he needed your protection,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.710

do your duty properly.

I think

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.390
it's because Chief Administrator Du

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.940
trusts Official Lu.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.159
let me make this clear to you.

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.830
If you find Bai Ze,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.520
the credit goes to Chief Administrator Du.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.920
If you fail to find it,

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.220
the blame falls on you

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.800
for not trying hard enough.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.830
Y-Your Highness,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.270
I didn't mean it that way.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.200
Did I allow you to defend yourself?

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.670
Step back!

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.560
Yes.

Lu Tong,

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.720
you've brought

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.430
quite the elite force.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.950
The appearance of Bai Ze

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.280
is an auspicious sign for the Tang Empire.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.190
His Majesty has ordered
the Right Imperial Guards

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.800
to assist Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.160
Thus, Ding Heng
and the other three officers

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.020
will cooperate with Lu Lingfeng.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.000
Chancellor Cui,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.450
four generals of the Imperial Guards—

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.120
that's eight sharp eyes.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.360
Surely at least one of them

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.160
will spot the auspicious beast.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.080
That's what he means, right?

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.240
Grand General, your subordinates

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.550
surely wouldn't fabricate things, right?

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.870
However,

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.950
it's possible

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.080
that for the lure

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.400
of gold and rank,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.010
someone might take desperate measures.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.480
Defying Heaven's will

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.430
invites divine punishment.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.640
Should something like that happen,

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.120
it would surely harm

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.159
the Tang Empire's fortune.

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.720
Therefore,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.190
I can't allow anything

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.060
that endangers
the Tang Empire's prosperity to happen,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.800
can I?

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.070
The Grand Princess
truly cares for the country

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.000
and takes responsibility
without hesitation.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.630
Li Nai'er.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.310
Yes.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.190
I appoint you

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.340
as Commander of the Princess's Guards.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.010
Join the search for Bai Ze immediately.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.210
Keep an eye on these people

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.800
so they don't deceive their superiors

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.360
or commit acts against Heaven's will.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.070
Yes.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.580
Your Highness,

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.760
she's a woman.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.370
What of it?

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.100
Back then, Princess Pingyang

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.530
made glorious military achievements
for the founding of the Tang Empire.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.180
And Empress Wu Zetian

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.000
is blessed by Heaven

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.700
and revered by all nations.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.770
I am a woman too.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.040
What?

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.120
A woman can't witness

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.360
the Tang Empire's auspicious beast?

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.500
I do not doubt Bai Ze's existence.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.040
I just won't allow

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.790
anyone to fabricate lies,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.820
deceive the Emperor,

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.530
and fool the people.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.360
But it might be inconvenient

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.510
for Commander Li to go to Mount Zhongnan

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.110
as the only woman in the team.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.020
No need for your concern, Grand General.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.000
Huo Jing.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:25.080
[Huo Jing, a hunter]

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.630
Yes.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.750
Huo Jing was born
to a hunter's family in Mount Zhongnan.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.850
She can accompany me

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:31.980
and serve as a guide.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.910

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.600

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.450
the mountain from here.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.270
Wait.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.240
You're the guide,

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.200
but have you never
been deep into Mount Zhongnan?

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.550
I'm a hunter from this area.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.600
Of course I have.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.100
Then why don't you know

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.870
that taking the Heartbreak Cliff route

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.670
would save us four hours' climb?

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.750
There really is a shortcut?

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.320
Yes,

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.910
but it's quite steep.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.440
I didn't want to tire you, officers.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.340
You'd rather take the long way.
Are you stupid?

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.320
Look at us.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.550
Which of us looks too weak

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.880
to handle a steep cliff?

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.510
Me.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.960
I am.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.270
I think Ling Ji was just trying

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.050
to look after a weak scholar like me,

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.600
right?

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.730
Take the shortcut.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.280
General Ding.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.860
On this mission,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.030
the leader should be Official Lu.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.910
Even though you're
the General of the Right Imperial Guards,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.240
it's not your place to give orders.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.140
Official Lu.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.440
Please.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.320
Huo Jing,

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.720
you'll guide us for now.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.450
Lead the way.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.150
We'll take the shortcut into the mountain.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.080
General Ding,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.630
why are we following his orders?

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.690
It doesn't matter.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.270
The depths of Mount Zhongnan
are perilous after all.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.320
If a guide or some official

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:23.970
falls from a cliff,

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.700
wouldn't that be quite normal?

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.960
Where's the path?

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.330
Tell me where the path is!

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.860
We need to leave the horses.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.550
Climb this narrow path
to the top of the cliff,

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.000
and we'll have entered
the depths of Mount Zhongnan.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.600
Ling Ji.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.800
Is this the right way?

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.610
It is the right way,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.630
but

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.240
after we climb this cliff,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.840
we'll go through a dense wood

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.030
and then a stretch

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.230
of cliff-side trail—

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.200
very hard to pass.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.320
Beneath the most dangerous spot,
the drop is immeasurable.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.030
That's why I originally planned
to take you all...

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.030
You scoundrel!

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.840
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.180
Who gave you the right to hit him?

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.080
What business is it of yours if I hit him?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.370
We are both hunters,

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.810
bound by the same fate.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.840
He is a guide, not a slave.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.780
You should've respected him,

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.840
but instead you insulted and hit him.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.030
Aren't you afraid

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.610
he'll lead you into a den of wolves
or a tiger's lair

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.010
to get you torn to pieces?

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.290
What did you say?

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.450
Do you have a death wish?

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.700
Stop it, all of you!

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.830
Stop! Stop!

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.150
Commander Li, you're a heroine
no less capable than a man.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.270
Your martial arts skills

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.550
are truly remarkable.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.530
Official Huo, you showed mercy to a woman,

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.870
never using a killing move.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:29.970
Official Lu,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.170
w-why don't you say something?

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.390
We are here by the Emperor's decree

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.870
to search for Bai Ze in the mountain.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.200
We are a team and must not

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.840
fight among ourselves.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.300
Huo You,

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.270
Ling Ji is the guide hired

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.670
by Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.790
You shouldn't have abused him at will.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.790
Apologize to him.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.970
Lu Lingfeng.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:09.240
Ling Ji,

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.520
how exactly is the path ahead?

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.180
Though dangerous,

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.930
if we are extremely careful,

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:15.920
we can make it through.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.120
It really does save

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.870
four hours of mountain travel.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.670
Then I'll take the lead with you.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.530
Please, Ding, cover the rear.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.470
Wait a moment.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.480
If you ask me,

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.440
better let General Ding

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.210
lead with the Imperial Guards.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.480
Their martial arts are superb.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.030
Climbing cliffs

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.390
is nothing to them.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.500
As for me,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.750
I'm clumsy.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.110
I'll walk behind Commander Li.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.320
If I can't make it up,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.370
I'll trouble you to give me a pull.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.600
Official Lu,

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.220
you'll cover the rear.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.640
You won't let me give orders,

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.100
but what are you doing?

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.600
I'm the so-called
Criminal Investigation Scholar,

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.400
but actually,

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.940
I'm just Official Lu's personal secretary.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.120
A secretary's job

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.500
is to offer him advice.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.150
Su Wuming is indeed a burden.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.790
He's afraid that if I'm in the front,

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.050
I won't look after him,

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.000
and he won't be able
to climb up by himself.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.730
In that case,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.320
Ding, please

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.950
lead the way up front.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:21.130
Alright.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.960
What are you up to?

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.000
Keep your eyes wide open.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.950
The two girls from the Princess's Mansion—

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.250
you must ensure their safety.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.270
Leave the horses.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:43.600
Lead the way.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.440
This is the only way up the mountain.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.040
Come up. This path is passable!

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.160
Let's go.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.250
Let's go.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.000
The peak of Mount Zhongnan

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.000
has breathtaking scenery

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.530
with an unobstructed view.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.240
Chang'an

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.240
is truly a blessed land.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.320
It's not only surrounded by eight rivers,

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.670
but once you leave the city,

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.530
there are green mountains everywhere.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:05.550
How beautiful

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.589
Chang'an is!

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.849
How magnificent

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.069
the Tang Empire is!

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.060
What is that sound?

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.030
General,

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:24.859
could that be Bai Ze?

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.480
Maybe Bai Ze really

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.720
exists in this mountain.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.640
What do you mean "maybe"?

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.900
It definitely exists.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.570
Ling Ji saw it with his own eyes.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:32.700
Didn't you, Ling Ji?

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.030
Yes.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:35.960
Yes.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.820
You, the guide,

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.640
can't you tell

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.440
what kind of wild beast that was?

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.710
It's... it's a tiger.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.480
A tiger?

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.970
Officers, please be careful.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.870
The tigers here are very fierce.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.830
Since we've already met tigers,

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.490
we'll surely find Bai Ze soon.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.450
Official Lu,

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.250
there are tigers ahead.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.750
Let me take the lead.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.260
I will lead.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.480
Su Wuming,

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.730
I'll go with General Ding.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.030
You stay in the back

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.290
and follow closely behind Commander Li.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.690
Let's go.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.000
Come on.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.440
No need.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:31.270
Lu,

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:32.550
in the past, you and I

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.610
both served under the Grand General.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.640
We both helped suppress the Tanglong Coup.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.790
For this mountain expedition,

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.790
no matter who finds Bai Ze first,

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.750
we will share the credit.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:42.610
What do you say?

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.880
Bai Ze is just a legendary creature.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.930
How could we possibly find it?

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.790
If you don't believe Bai Ze exists,

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.650
why did you take this assignment?

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.280
Her Highness ordered me
to join this search

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.550
to prevent anyone from using

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.790
the tales of the auspicious beast

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.050
to deceive the people.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.640
Haven't you noticed?

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.420
Some have already begun to waver.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.320
When there is a wise ruler,

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.830
Bai Ze appears.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.310
That's what common people believe.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.780
Are you on Her Highness's side or not?

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.400
Looks like it's going to rain.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.460
This is the path I mentioned.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.440
If it rains,
it'll be slippery and more dangerous.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.750
Ling Ji,

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.350
from your experience,

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.680
how long until it rains?

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.790
About 15 minutes.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.890
And it'll be a heavy one.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.210
What a scene!
Mount Zhongnan before the rain.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.390
Su Wuming.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.940
If Xijun were here,

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.170
she'd definitely paint this.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.320
Yeah.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.550
If only she could've come.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.590
A view like this—

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.100
Yingtao would love it too.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.280
Enough admiring the scenery.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.790
Are we pressing on

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.830
or going back to the woods

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.430
to camp until the rain stops?

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.470
Since we're already here,

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.700
we'll advance in the wind

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.900
without hesitation.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.590
Great minds think alike.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.790
Then everyone, put on your rain gear.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.120
Once it starts raining,

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.510
the path will be muddy and slippery.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.770
Be extremely careful.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.710
Official Lu,

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.830
to search for Bai Ze for His Majesty,

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.500
you do not fear danger at all.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.760
It's truly admirable.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.350
Do as Official Lu said.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.790
Put on your rain gear properly.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:42.400
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:42.920
Yes.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:57.880
Ling Ji,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:58.920
lead the way.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:00.440
Okay.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.070
General, please go ahead.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.260
I need to relieve myself.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.320
I'll catch up soon.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:16.760
Lu Lingfeng,

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.090
didn't I tell you to cover the rear?

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:51.860
Be careful!

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.080
Let's go.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.480
Watch out!

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.400
Stop staring at your feet,

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.160
and you won't be so afraid.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.490
Fear causes you to slip.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.340
Thank you, Commander Li.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.540
You be careful too.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.890
It's so slippery.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:07.680
Don't touch me,

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.710
you shameless scoundrel!

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.240
Huo Jing!

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:24.270
Commander Li,

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.390
be careful!

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.550
Huo Jing!

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:27.890
What happened?

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:30.070
Huo Jing fell off the cliff!

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.180
She didn't fall.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.240
It was him!

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.590
He pushed Huo Jing down.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.270
No.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:36.510
That female guide

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.170
slipped and fell by accident.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:40.840
Step back.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.590
Stop!

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.110
Lu Lingfeng, get out of the way!

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.450
Let me kill this lecher!

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.240
General,

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.310
I really didn't push that female guide!

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.110
You're lying!

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.550
I heard Huo Jing myself.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.610
She said you groped her.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.110
You must have molested her from behind!

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.830
I didn't!

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.270
I just caught up

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.390
and heard her scream.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.480
Then she drew her weapon
and charged at me.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.830
Unfortunately, she was a bad fighter.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.240
I blocked twice with my sword.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.270
She lost her footing

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:48.530
and fell off the cliff!

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.030
You killed Huo Jing!

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.170
Pay with your life!

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.590
Stop fighting!

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.440
If the ground gives way,

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.490
the consequences will be dire!

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.080
Su Wuming has a point.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.840
Go to a safe place first.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.590
Then settle this.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:05.110
No!

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.830
I must kill this lecher

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.010
to avenge Huo Jing!

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.480
Commander Li,

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:13.150
do you want me to die with you?

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.280
A ghost!

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.270
A ghost!

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.680
General!

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.880
There's a ghost!

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:11.440
Where?

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:12.860
Over there.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.930
Isn't it just a corpse in the wild?

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.000
When this woman was alive,

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.790
she must have been pretty.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:36.320
Let's go.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:44.220
Huo You!

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.150
These Imperial Guards

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.400
are all vulgar and disrespectful men.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.960
They even make lewd comments
about an old lady

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.490
who died in the wilderness.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.790
Now you must believe

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.520
that he killed Huo Jing, right?

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:02.750
I...

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:03.500
Huo,

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.900
you and I will duel right here.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.440
If you defeat me, you may kill

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.720
or torture me as you wish.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.890
If you lose,

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.530
I will cut off your head

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.750
to avenge Huo Jing!

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:13.700
Don't!

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.110
Commander Li,

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.730
you are only one person,

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.000
and there are four of them.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.640
How can you possibly defeat them?

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.980
Su Wuming!

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.030
Are you suggesting

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:34.380
that we Imperial Guards
would gang up on her?

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.830
That's not what I mean.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.350
I mean…

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.510
Then cut the crap!

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:40.310
Commander Li,

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.750
Huo You is injured.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.210
If you want a duel,

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.680
I, Ding Heng,

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.230
will fight with you.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:54.350
Ding.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.470
Didn't we come to Mount Zhongnan

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:58.960
for something important?

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.110
Commander Li.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.830
Did the Princess send you here

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:07.490
to challenge people to duels?

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.160
General, calm down.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.290
We've got a mission.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.710
We're here to find Bai Ze.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.890
Let's get out of this place now.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:17.630
This place

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.510
is too inauspicious.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:24.720
Ling Ji.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:26.480
Officer.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.680
Anywhere else
to take shelter from the rain?

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.010
There's a temple ahead.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:32.350
What kind of temple?

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.160
I don't know

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.300
its exact name.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:36.440
Wild beasts show up around here.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.720
We usually skirt the area.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.180
We don't fear wild beasts.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.050
If there's a temple,

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.830
there must be shelter from the rain.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.230
Hurry up and lead the way.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.480
Lu,

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.030
let's first go to the temple to rest.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.330
When the rain stops,

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:54.080
we'll look for Bai Ze again.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.970
What do you say?

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:58.360
Alright.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.920
Get ready to move.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.000
Okay.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.310
Get your things.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:03.830
Yes.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.920
That's the place.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.310
What kind of place is that?

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:28.570
It looks a bit strange.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.030
Structurally,

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.070
it doesn't look like a regular temple

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.070
or Daoist shrine.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.010
Judging by its appearance,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.320
it doesn't look empty.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.340
It's not empty.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.770
Someone lives here.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.400
They specifically take in travelers

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.730
who need a place to rest.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:45.320
Let's go!

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:47.120
Let's go.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.110
Ling Ji,

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.510
go knock on the door.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:05.920
Yes.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.880
Is anyone inside?

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.900
We need shelter from the rain!

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:16.160
Move aside!

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:17.720
What's the point of yelling?

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.750
With such heavy rain,

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:19.840
can anyone hear you?

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.970
Just go straight in.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.130
Is anyone here?

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.680
Open the door!

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.620
Open the door!

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:21.640
Who's it?

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:22.690
Come out!

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.900
You old crone,

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:39.240
you gave us a fright!

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.220
If you hadn't come,

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.690
how could I have scared you?

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:44.550
You…

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:45.070
Huo You.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.200
Put down your swords.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:52.440
What do you want?

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.640
Madam,

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.640
we are travelers in the mountains,

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.680
just passing through here.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.810
Caught in the storm,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.280
we'd like a place to stay.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.280
Is that possible?

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.390
That depends on
whether the temple master agrees.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.190
Go inside.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.510
Wake up.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.290
We've got visitors.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:37.510
How did so many people

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.920
show up at once?

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:46.240
Sir,

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:47.400
tell me,

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.440
what kind of temple is this?

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.900
What deity do you worship?

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.590
What deity do I worship?

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:54.880
Can't you tell?

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.550
Then I'm afraid

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:58.720
I cannot take you in.

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:00.370
Get out, all of you!

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.490
You old fool,

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.400
do you know who you are talking to?

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.730
I don't care who you are!

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:05.550
Listen.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.050
Every table and chair in this temple,

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.320
every meal and cup of tea,

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.630
is a gift from the deity.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:11.760
If you don't recognize the deity,

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.489
how can I possibly let you stay?

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.340
This is…

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:21.010
Huo You.

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:25.219
Where is Su Wuming?

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.139
Here. Here I am.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.840
I feel like I've heard

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.219
those words before.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.969
Enough chatter.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.760
Look.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.500
A dragon's head, deer antlers,

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.159
and a pair of wings.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.520
What kind of deity is this?

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.380
Hold it higher.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.460
Bai Ze!

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.110
Su Wuming,

00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:59.930
don't speak nonsense.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.710
How is that nonsense?

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.230
When I first saw this temple,

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.280
I immediately thought of the records

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.140
in "Wonders of Mount Zhongnan"
from the Jin period.

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.150
During the reign of Emperor Ling
of the Later Han,

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.190
the Yellow Turban Rebellion

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.400
threw the country into chaos.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.670
The people donated gold and silver

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800
to build temples in Mount Zhongnan

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.020
for the Four Auspicious Beasts,

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.320
praying for a wise ruler

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.190
to end the turmoil.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.400
Later, in the Sui dynasty’s revised

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.970
"New Wonders of Mount Zhongnan,"

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.920
Emperor Yang

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:37.530
sent men deep into Mount Zhongnan

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.840
to search for the temples
of the Four Auspicious Beasts.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.150
They found that three of them
had already fallen into ruin.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.840
Only

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.630
the Bai Ze Temple
was still standing strong.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.410
So he ordered it to be repaired.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.730
A small temple deep in the mountains

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.250
is nothing unusual.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.140
But for a temple of this magnitude,

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.590
it must have been built
with imperial funds.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:59.550
Sir,

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.110
am I right?

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:03.920
You are right.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.760
This place is indeed the Bai Ze Temple.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.410
This is the statue of Bai Ze.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.920
It was first built during the reign
of Emperor Ling of the Later Han.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.980
Emperor Yang of Sui

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.970
later had it gilded anew.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.190
This is truly marvelous!

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.760
Although we have not yet seen Bai Ze,

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.670
we've entered the Bai Ze Temple first.

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:26.070
I'd say success

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.730
is within arm's reach.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.070
I'll pay my respects to the statue.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.280
Wei Qi is absolutely right.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.940
We shall all pay our respects.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.760
I'll pay respects too.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.280
Please.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.320
Please help us find Bai…

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.070
Make room.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.680
I'll pay my respects too.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.480
I'll pray for safety.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:56.890
Sir, how should we address you?

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.760
Because I cultivate here,

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.190
the hunters and woodcutters

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.840
all call me Hermit Baize.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:07.590
This is my wife, Zi.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.110
Since this is the Bai Ze Temple,

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:14.590
have the two of you

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:15.800
ever seen Bai Ze?

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.510
Bai Ze

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.850
is a divine beast.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.280
[Hermit Baize] [Zi]

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.140
How could ordinary people see it?

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.000
So you're saying

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:26.230
there's no Bai Ze in Mount Zhongnan?

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.410
Since you've entered the Bai Ze Temple,

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.520
you're no longer ordinary people.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.420
If you want to see Bai Ze,

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.320
you only need to stay

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.630
in my temple for a few days.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.760
When the weather clears

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.230
and golden light
shines through the clouds,

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:44.550
Bai Ze will appear on its own.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.360
Really?

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.400
Of course.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.320
This is its temple.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.320
It often comes

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.150
to walk in this hall.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.280
Otherwise,

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.480
why would I have

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.760
built the temple gate so tall?

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.590
It's to make sure
the auspicious beast, Bai Ze, can enter.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:02.120
General,

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:03.430
did you hear all that?

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.370
Whether it's true or not,

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:06.920
tonight,

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.680
we need to stay here.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.710
No problem.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.360
The east and west wing rooms are clean.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.320
There are two more rooms upstairs.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.650
My wife and I occupy one,

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:17.790
and the other is empty.

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:19.110
Do you have any food?

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.880
We're soaked and starving.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.650
Yes.

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.610
We have fine wine too!

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.880
Let me tell you,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.190
you should all thank him.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:30.150
Otherwise, I would never

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.200
bring out the wine

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.420
to entertain you bunch of strangers.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.310
Zi,

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.510
put down the doll

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.590
and go cook.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:39.810
Alright.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.200
Everyone, please wait a moment.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:46.270
Meanwhile, you can enjoy some folk tales
from the temple master.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.480
You know folk tales?

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:54.080
More than that.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.670
Whenever he has free time,

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:57.400
he tells fascinating stories.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.630
Every traveler who rests here

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.920
praises him for it.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:01.850
Wonderful!

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.430
To be honest,

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.510
since I was a kid,

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.630
I've loved listening to folk tales.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:07.960
Sir,

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.550
what story will you tell us tonight?
