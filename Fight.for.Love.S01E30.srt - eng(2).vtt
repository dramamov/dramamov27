Girl, bear with it.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.500
Let me treat your wound.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.700
It won't hurt.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.400
You have to let me do it,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.430
or it will leave a scar.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.510
It'll be ugly.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.400
I will be gentle.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400
Just bear with it.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.790
Don't move, please.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.230
Hey, it's fine.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.530
I will hold you, okay?

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.180
Miss,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.740
am I not brave enough?

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.660
Even the bravest young lady

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.220
has something to be afraid of.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.020
How about this?

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.380
I'll sing you a song.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.980
My Lady, be careful.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.380
Thanks for your help just now.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.490
I really couldn't handle

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.400
these children.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.710
On this journey,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.790
you taught me how to climb walls
and windows,

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.550
make a fire, bandage wounds,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.740
and treat injuries.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.820
Is there anything you can't do?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.560
When Ms. Chu and I

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.050
were in Fengling,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.970
we often did that.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.260
So, I don't find it hard.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.180
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.860
I really couldn't imagine

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.340
that outside Huajing,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.420
- they are living
- Thanks.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.460
- such a life.
- Thanks.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.500
When I was upset

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.020
about not getting fine jewels,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.220
they were thinking

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.380
about whether they could survive

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.700
to see tomorrow's sun.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.740
Yes.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.940
It is these common people

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.300
who are hurt the most by the war.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.940
My Lady,

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.660
the reason we can
live peacefully in Huajing

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.140
is that we have soldiers

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.820
like your father and your brother

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.300
guarding us at the front.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.740
Your sister used to go

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.580
to the battlefield and fight

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.820
with your brother.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.140
She was so impressive.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.580
I just don't know

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.740
how they are now.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.940
If Yu can protect the people,

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.260
so can I.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.960
Though I'm not as capable as she is,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.600
I will also do my best

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.680
to help more people.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.280
Move aside.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.400
Follow up.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.080
Wanyue, do you think it's still possible

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.960
for me to learn medicine now?

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.920
Now?

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.820
Forget it.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.820
It takes too long.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.220
After I go back to Huajing,

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.340
I'll open a pharmacy first.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.820
That way, I can still help them.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.380
This is the place.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.780
There's an entrance
under the kitchen stove,

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.620
which leads to the workshop

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.700
through a zip line.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.740
These people

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.060
have not wasted their time in Great Sui.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.020
Apart from stealing

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.580
my precious blueprints,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.700
they've also learned military tactics

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.940
and how to hide the truth.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.620
Commander.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.020
Commander,

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.580
though I respect and love you,

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.980
could you please pay attention

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.940
to the occasion?

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.100
- This...
- It's just a habit.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.300
It's just a habit.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.780
Why are we preparing these things?

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.420
I was told

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.580
that the King caught

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.620
a Great Sui assassin today.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.700
At the ceremony tomorrow,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.260
we'll sacrifice her to the deer god.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.440
Commander,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.920
could the assassin

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.080
be Ms. Chu?

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.680
We can't let it happen.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.880
We have to get in there asap

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.960
and deploy.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.720
We must set off the explosion

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.560
before the ceremony

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.320
to create a chance
for Ms. Chu to escape.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.480
Yes.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.440
Let's go.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.400
You're a prisoner now.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.960
What are you so proud of?

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.940
You can confine me,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.010
but can you confine the people?

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.100
When I become king,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.980
what is there to fear about the people?

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.900
A world built on corpses

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.300
and blood.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.900
Do you think you can

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.180
hold on for long?

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.420
It is you who have no way out,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.860
not me.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.700
Since I dared to come in,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.060
I never thought about a way out.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.900
If Great Sui is about to fall,

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.500
why should I care about my life?

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.860
That's not necessarily true.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.900
Chu Yu.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.300
Your Highness.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.180
How dare you?

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.940
I can do worse.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.620
Continue.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.820
Stop!

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:06.900
Stop!

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.900
Changming,

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.580
you know what I want.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.900
As long as you say yes,

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.700
I will let her go.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:19.980
If you don't,

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.780
she won't die in my hands today,

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.100
but in yours.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.860
Alright.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.900
I agree.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.300
Your Highness...

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:57.820
I beg of you.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.980
Your Highness...

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.620
I beg of you to let her go.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.380
I've followed you for years,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.740
and you've never begged anyone.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.300
Today, you actually begged me

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.700
for her.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.980
Take Changming back.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.940
Yes.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.420
Your Highness.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.780
Your Highness...

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.580
Your Highness.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.700
You have lost.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.860
Do you think

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.060
that her begging

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.460
means you have won?

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.360
Why don't you

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.160
take a look at this thing?

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.520
What?

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.200
Isn't this thing

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.200
very familiar?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.880
Wei Yun was as reckless as you,

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.740
bringing only a small squad

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.700
into the heart of North Qi.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.700
Chu Yu,

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.340
guess

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.060
if Wei Yun is still alive.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.820
He overestimated himself,
intruding into North Qi

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.180
to assassinate Su Can.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.900
Who gave him such courage?

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.800
But now,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.600
it's good that he

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.360
and his entire family have reunited

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.840
in the underworld.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.680
It's a pity

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.760
that neither of us has seen it.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.280
It's North Qi's sacrificial ceremony

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.240
tomorrow.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.600
With the blessing of the deer god,

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.440
I should have mercy.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.860
After the ceremony,

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.660
I will let you join Wei Yun

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.740
in the underworld

Wei Yun,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.240
you didn't disgrace your family.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.720
(Don't worry.)

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.240
(I will definitely)

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.920
(fulfill my mission.)

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.920
(Qi)

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.560
The Marquis of Zhenguo of Great Sui

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.480
is nothing but a ghost under my knife.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.720
Once I take two more cities

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.640
and head straight for Huajing,

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.600
Great Sui will be under my rule.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.320
Long live the King!

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.120
Long live the King!

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.480
An ambush!

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.480
Su Can.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.960
Who is here?

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.280
Even if I've become a ghost,

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.640
I'll crawl back from the netherworld

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.920
to kill you!

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.680
King Su Can of North Qi,

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.360
I've long heard of your name.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.080
I'm Wei Yun.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.400
You are not dead.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.200
All of this is a conspiracy.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.880
Someone brought you here.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.760
Gongsun Lan dared to betray me.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.920
If someone has betrayed you,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.800
it is the will of heaven

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.280
and the wish of the people.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.800
In the battle today,

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.040
you may not necessarily win.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.680
Since you are not dead,

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.640
then I will kill you

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.680
with my own hands.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.680
North Qi soldiers,

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.720
he's the Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.800
Whoever kills him

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.640
will be promoted and rewarded.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.360
Kill him!

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.160
Kill!

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.640
General, this is a tough battle.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.920
Battles are never easy.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.320
We must kill Su Can today.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.400
I will live and die

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.160
with all of you.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.760
Kill them!

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.840
The people of Great Sui

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.800
have always valued harmony.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.080
We've never started wars lightly,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.360
or coveted others' territories.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.160
Today, I will use your blood

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.080
to honor the souls
of the Great Sui heroes.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.680
In your dreams.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.640
Su Can,

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.760
remember:

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.880
The one who kills you today

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.920
is the people of Great Sui.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.560
I've beheaded Su Can,

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.920
King of North Qi.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.400
Spread the word:

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.000
King Su Can of North Qi is dead.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.440
Young Marquis,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.080
your plan of faking death

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.080
is really brilliant.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.320
This battle

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.880
was fought really well.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.840
Wei Qiu,

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.280
spread the news

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.520
as quickly as possible.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.480
Yes.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.200
Covered in injuries,

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.280
where are you going?

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:57.880
To Fengling.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.760
You've just finished a fierce battle;

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.040
your strength is exhausted.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.760
How can you go to support Fengling?

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.720
Su Can is dead.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.520
Qingzhou is no longer in danger.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.040
But the situation
in Fengling is unclear.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.480
I have to hurry there.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.200
Since you've made up your mind,

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.000
I won't be wasting your time

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.600
by trying to stop you.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.480
After going back,

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.240
do you know what to do?

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.920
Please rest assured.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.520
If Yunyang asks,

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.040
I'll say, "Wei Yun's fake death trick"

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.080
"was too insidious."

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.560
"Even I believed it."

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.440
Qi Lan from the 6th Division
of the Arsenal Bureau,

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.680
when the homeland is reclaimed,

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.200
I'll see you in your true identity.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.720
It's all the North Qi troops patrolling.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.400
Qingzhou is under their control.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.200
We can always find a way

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.160
to deal with the situation.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.400
Wenchang,

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.960
let's find Chusheng first.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.120
Sure.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.400
Let's go.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.720
(Qingzhou Yamen)

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.180
Commander Gao,

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.140
a drink to you.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.620
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.580
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.900
Bring me some more wine.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.860
We've just taken Qingzhou.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.240
Aren't you celebrating

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.560
a bit too early?

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.440
Isn't this Deputy Shen

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.920
appointed by Princess Yunyang?

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.900
I think Deputy Shen

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.540
is jealous of Commander Gao

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.060
for achieving such a great merit

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.020
and is trying to dampen our spirits.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.460
I'm just reminding you all

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.660
not to lose the bigger picture.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.820
The people of Great Sui are cunning.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.200
Be careful not to fall for their tricks.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.480
Deputy Shen,

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.520
don't worry unnecessarily.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.120
Qingzhou has fallen.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.720
We'll spare this traitor for now.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.920
When Wei Yun comes,

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.600
we'll use him to consecrate our flag.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.600
You're just a traitor.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.880
What can you do?

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.400
I've heard that your father

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.200
is the Chancellor of Great Sui.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.520
If he saw you like this,

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.680
would he jump

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.640
out of his coffin?

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.680
Commander Gao,

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.000
wouldn't you become his savior?

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.840
How dare you glare at me?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.280
Have you seen that, Deputy Shen?

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.100
This guy is just a coward.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.300
He dares to be angry

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.300
but doesn't dare to speak.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.500
Go get the wine.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.780
If you're even half a minute late,

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.500
I'll make you

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.460
crawl out.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.580
Chusheng.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.620
Chusheng, it's me.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.020
How are you?

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.100
Shilan was right.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.860
We knew
you wouldn't be killed so easily.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.740
Why are you here?

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.860
We've settled the people.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:42.860
We were worried about you

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.260
and came through the secret passage.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.620
Leave here with us now.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.900
- Let's go.
- Wait.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.540
Listen to me.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.260
If there's a chance tonight

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.780
to take back Qingzhou,

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.660
would you be willing

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.460
to take a gamble with me?

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.900
- Come on.
- Cheers.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.500
Pour the wine for me.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.180
Why are you so slow?

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.900
Hurry up and come here.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.660
Pour the wine for me.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.780
Are you deaf?

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.860
If you don't want to die, move faster.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.660
Fools.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.140
Attention, everyone.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.780
A surprise attack inside the yamen.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.060
Follow me to support.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.900
King Su Can of North Qi is dead!

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.660
King Su Can of North Qi is dead!

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.500
King Su Can of North Qi

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.980
has been killed
by the Marquis of Zhenguo!

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.020
Heaven blesses Great Sui!

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.460
King Su Can of North Qi is dead!

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.780
- Su Can
- Look.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.540
- has been killed!
- The King's sword.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.820
Heaven blesses Great Sui!

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.340
- Su Can is dead!
- Run!

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.980
(Qingzhou City)
Heaven blesses Great Sui!

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.300
(Qi)
Run!

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.260
Retreat!

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.780
Report!

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.780
King Su Can of North Qi

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.340
has been killed
by the Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.980
The North Qi troops outside
have run away.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.700
Yun.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.140
Report! King Su Can of North Qi

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.380
has been killed
by the Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.020
The North Qi troops outside
have run away.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.660
Soldiers,

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.540
follow me to take back Qingzhou!

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.780
Kill them!

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.860
Kill them!

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.420
Mr. Gu.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.500
Don't kill me, Mr. Gu.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.020
Spare my life.

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:24.400
Please spare my life.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.820
I'll serve you.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.980
Mr. Gu, I can serve you.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.220
Ms. Chu, you've arrived just in time.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.860
Since you are a guest,

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.100
please look carefully.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.920
This is a sacrifice
to the spirits of those

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.160
who died on the battlefield.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.400
It is in honor

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.320
of the heroes of North Qi.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.600
What heroes?

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.960
They invaded Great Sui

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.160
to gain the merits.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.080
They're a group of bandits,

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.360
killers, and demons.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.440
They're not heroes at all.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.400
Enough.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.400
Are you going to proceed
with the ceremony?

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.120
What?

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.800
You feel sorry for her again?

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.960
She serves me.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.440
Why can't I feel sorry for her?

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:02.580
Zhao Yue,

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.020
since I promised

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.140
to accompany you in the sacrifice,

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.070
you must keep your word.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.520
Please preside over the ceremony.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.560
Changming.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.640
Why do you look so upset

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.280
when sacrificing our heroes?

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.200
Since she serves you,

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.320
go and take her blood.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.480
Today, we're here

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.200
to hold a sacrificial ceremony.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.280
With the blood of Great Sui,

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.090
we honor the martyrs of North Qi

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:45.220
who sacrificed in the war.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.000
May the spirits bless our soldiers

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.140
to be invincible in battle

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.720
and help me unify the world.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:00.740
Sacrifice to the god!

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.420
Report!

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.180
Our underground workshop

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.140
has been destroyed.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.780
(Lu Qiba did it.)

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.140
Is everyone okay?

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.540
- I'm fine.
- I'm fine.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.420
Wei Shuo,

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.340
is my face okay?

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.740
It's fine.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.820
I was so scared.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.220
What a lousy place.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.220
So big.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.500
Luckily, we ran fast,

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.140
or we would've all died there today.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.740
What time is it?

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.620
It's past the Si hour.

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.020
The ceremony has begun.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:51.900
It's too late.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:52.900
Everyone,

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.860
rescue Ms. Chu.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:54.980
Yes.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.140
None of you will get away.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.100
Go!

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.700
Everyone,

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.700
let's make it quick.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.660
Yes!

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.180
Go and investigate.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.100
Report to me right away.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.060
Yes.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.140
Follow me.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.120
Chu Yu,

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.080
it's you.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.800
Chu Yu, run!

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.460
- Your Highness.
- Save Fengling. Don't worry about me.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:29.660
Go.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.740
Go!

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.300
Changming.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.140
Bring her back for me.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.100
Yes.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.260
You deceived me with Chu Yu.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.100
Li Changming!

00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.660
Chu Yu,

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.060
you didn't disappoint me.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.820
If you hadn't left the clues,

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.820
we wouldn't have found

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.780
this place so quickly.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:06.860
Your Highness,

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.340
is it Xue Hanmei who locked you up here?

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.780
He is not Xue Hanmei.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.820
He is Zhao Yue.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.300
The child born from the affair

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.300
between Princess Yunyang

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.300
and the Lord of Qin is him.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.100
He's been the one

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.720
causing trouble in Great Sui.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.040
The battles of Qingzhou and Fengling

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.340
started because of him.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.140
With Fengling and Qingzhou in danger,

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.740
I came here to find

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.460
his crossbow workshop and destroy it.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.620
You want to destroy that place?

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.300
Do you need my help?

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.020
Don't worry about this.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.100
I've had a plan.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:41.900
Your Highness,

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.180
please hold on a little longer.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.380
I'll definitely find a way

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.380
to get you out of here.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.740
Though Zhao Yue is cunning,

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.140
he does have

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.220
some feelings for me.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.860
So, you don't need
to worry about my safety.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.320
If something happens,

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.400
I will find a way to help you.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.840
(I started all of this,)

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.560
(so I have to end it myself.)

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.020
Your Majesty,
all the octagonal crossbows

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:22.940
have been destroyed in the fire.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.510
Also, we just received news:

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.940
Su Can is dead;

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:27.860
Qingzhou is lost.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.700
Please calm down.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.500
The workshop has been destroyed,

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.620
and this place has been discovered.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.460
I'm afraid it won't be long

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.900
before the Great Sui army arrives.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.100
You can't stay here any longer.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.780
Please leave now.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.100
I want to tear Chu Yu

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.300
into pieces.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.540
Your Majesty,

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.060
you can kill her anytime you want.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.060
Su Can is dead.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.820
Please hurry back to ascend the throne.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.300
That is the most important now.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.240
Zhao Yue,

00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.920
stop struggling.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.500
So what if you become the King?

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:04.940
You lost.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.580
Changming,

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.020
you say you hate deception the most.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.460
So do I.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.180
You are forcing me to kill you.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.040
So what?

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.200
Xue Hanmei,

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.360
I'm the Eldest Princess of Great Sui.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.920
Even if I have to die,

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.200
I will not collude with you,

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.240
a traitor from North Qi.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.520
I am a traitor?

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.000
Is your family the legitimate ruler?

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.360
You already know who my real father is.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.200
According to the rites of Great Sui,

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.640
part of the realm should have been mine.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.700
The Lord of Qin committed treason!

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.940
He is a sinner of Great Sui.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.180
Do you really think

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.580
you can inherit the throne of Great Sui?

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.020
Dream on.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.740
A kingdom consecrated

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.740
with the blood of Great Sui.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.820
Has the deer god blessed it?

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.220
No.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.060
You have lost.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.700
The winner takes all.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.740
I decide the outcome.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.340
I will rewrite

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.820
the history of Great Sui.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.820
Su Can is dead.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.780
Whether it is Great Sui,

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.940
North Qi,

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.540
or you,

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.380
they are all mine.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.060
Please, Your Majesty,

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.500
leave now.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.540
Leave.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.900
Chu Yu.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.340
Chu Yu.

♪Through mortal realms, serene I roam♪

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.760

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:08.960
What's wrong?

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.600
Are you hurt?

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.880
Wei Yun,

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.400
is it really you?

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.840
I'm not dreaming, right?

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.040
You're still alive?

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.520
Of course.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.280
As long as I can get back to you,

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.480
I'll crawl back even if I have to.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.200
It's great.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.440
It's great to be alive.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.720
Wei Yun, hurry up.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.000
We need to rush to Fengling.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.400
Linyang is still waiting for us.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.560
Hurry up.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.920
On my way here,

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.840
I heard that reinforcements
have been sent to Fengling.

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.600
Moreover, with our current strength,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
it's hard to even walk,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.040
let alone help.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.440
Don't make your brother

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.920
distract himself to look after you.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.200
Is Fengling really okay?

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.160
Trust me.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.920
Why did you bring so few people

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.720
and rush into North Qi?

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.320
That was too reckless.

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.220
Yesterday,

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.860
Zhao Yue told me

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.020
that you were dead.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.820
I really believed it.

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.620
I couldn't think of a better way

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.660
than to assassinate Su Can.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:42.580
Indeed.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.700
That's the Wei Yun I know.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.860
However hard it might be,

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.300
no one can stop him.

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:56.140
You are also the Chu Yu I know.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.610
You won't just sit there
waiting for help.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.560
You'll try every means

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.960
to carve out a path.

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:08.580
Do you know?

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.660
When I heard

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.420
about your death,

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.340
and when I

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.140
was almost killed,

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.660
I was thinking

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:27.860
that I hadn't told you

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.220
something.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.860
Is it something I want to hear?
