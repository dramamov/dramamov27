WEBVTT

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.770
Shall we go

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.110
look in the mirror together?

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.280
But if we see him,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.270
don't leave me.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.079
Are you certain that it wasn't

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.460
another episode of sleepwalking?

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.290
There was

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.330
an elderly nurse

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.960
who walked into
the room, called me,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.540
and brought me out there!

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.880
It wasn't a dream!

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.830
You don't need to overthink it.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.330
Anybody can make
mistakes at any time.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.250
If something happens,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.330
you can let me know.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.960
You see, if a patient
doesn't trust a doctor.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.670
the treatment
will fail regardless.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.790
No going outside at night.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.790
Remember?

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.040
Alan!

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:37.960
I never wanted to leave you.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.500
Get out.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.380
Win!

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:37.539
I'm so sorry.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.670
I've never encountered
a situation like this before,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.460
so I'm not sure what to do.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.289
I haven't reported
to Dr.Nil yet.

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:45.380
Yes.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.380
But I'd like to ask you a favor.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.330
Please don't fire me.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.250
Doctor O.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:57.289
I've found him.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.960
Yes.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.210
I promise it won't
ever happen again.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.040
I'm sorry.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.830
Alan.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.710
Please don't run
away from me again.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.380
I know

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.540
you may have been
directed to do something.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.540
But that's how things work here.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.210
You must follow it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
If you don't follow the rules,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.130
me and the other nurse

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.630
could get into trouble as well.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.420
I'm really sorry, Pete.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.210
But...

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.829
Dr.O hasn't
reported to Dr.Nil yet

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.329
right?

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.829
Let's just say I'll make sure
Dr.Nil never hears about this.

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:39.829
Promise me

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:41.579
you won't ever do it again.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.670
Let me walk you to your room.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.540
Okay.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.710
So, where did you go?

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.500
I went down there
to look for the cards,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.880
but I couldn't find them.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.210
Listen,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.880
I'll tell you my secrets,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.250
and then you'll tell yours.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040
So, we'll be even.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.830
All right?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920
The truth is

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.079
I'm not into women.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.630
Back in the day, I always thought

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.750
I was into women

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.960
because my parents

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.630
loved to pair me up with the girls.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.920
But I'd never had a
date with any of them.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.750
Then I realized that

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.250
I was actually attracted to men.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.710
So...

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.420
have you ever had
a man as your lover?

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.460
I've told you enough.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.630
It's your turn to tell me now.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.960
Do you know a guy named Win?

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.380
Is this Win a friend of yours?

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:55.829
That's right.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.290
He's my friend.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.250
Well

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.420
He comes to see me all the time,

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.210
But I still have no idea

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.210
how he truly feels about me.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.130
Has he

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.540
ever done this to anyone else?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920
From what I've seen,

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.579
he has only done this to me.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.079
There it is,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.210
the answer.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.710
Mr. Alan.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.130
Let's go.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.420
Get some good rest, Alan.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.500
Thank you.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.000
Alan.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.580
Wake up.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.380
Why are you so shocked?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040
Hallucinating again?

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.960
Who are you?

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.580
What's this place?

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.080
You've forgotten me now?

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.630
Read this.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.630
Read it.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.420
Found it yet?

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.540
Who's this guy?

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.880
Win.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.830
Anyone else this good-looking?

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.790
Come here.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.830
Stop.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.670
How did you get in here anyway?

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.710
You didn't put the lock on.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.170
You sneaked in here again.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I didn't sneaked.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.460
I openly walked in

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.790
since you had been busy
dreaming about someone.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.250
Who else would I
be dreaming about?

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.460
I dunno, just asking.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.500
But you can't.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.170
Do not dream about other people.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.250
You hear that?

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.380
I'm the only one
you can dream about.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.170
Hey,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.750
Why can't I dream about
someone else too, huh?

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.500
Because

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.790
I want to be close
to you everywhere

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.170
whether in dreams

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.380
or in reality.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:51.790
And

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.130
how close can you be?

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.500
Closer than you imagine.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.830
An alarm?

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.380
Don't worry about it.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.630
Win.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.170
Hey!

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.130
You

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.420
You did it again!

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.960
Shocked?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.170
- Bless you.
- Stop!

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.210
You're coming in
here silently again.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.210
Sorry.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.000
What are you doing?

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:43.830
Not hungry?

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.830
You're not going
to get breakfast?

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.580
I'm not hungry yet.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.880
Are you hungry?

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.880
You go ahead and eat.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:53.710
Nope.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960
How energetic you are,

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.960
washing clothes in the morning.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.250
The weather is fine

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.290
so I wanted to wash my clothes.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.290
Is that wrong?

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.460
No.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.460
Or maybe...

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.080
What?

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.170
You pissed yourself on the bed?

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.210
Really!

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.750
Alan wetted the bed!

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.580
Alan wetted the bed!

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.580
Alan wetted the bed!

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.130
Stop.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.420
What?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.500
Alan peed himself.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.330
What?

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.130
Can't a grown man
wet his bed sometimes?

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.790
Asshole.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:38.880
I won't tell a single sole.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.880
I promise.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.500
You sure?

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.130
Jerk.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:52.830
So

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.040
why did you peed your pants?

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.040
what did you dream of?

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.290
I...

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.540
I dreamed about you.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.710
Me, really?

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.500
Well

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.040
In my dream,

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.250
I woke up and

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.170
was unable to
remember who you were.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.000
That's something
you could dream of?

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.330
Dreamed that you forgot me?

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.830
Why couldn't I?

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.080
I have brain disease, remember?

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:47.960
That's fine.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.380
I'm right here anyway.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.040
You haven't forgotten me.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.000
Watch it, I might wake up
and forget you for real someday.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.250
Take this and write it down.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.000
What if you really forget me?

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.210
Just say that you're
afraid of being forgotten.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.130
Today, a nurse brought
me to the room C02.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.170
Are you still conscious?

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.290
Breath in!

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.040
Sir.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.080
Hey

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.420
Why did they bring
me to that room?

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.790
Was there a relation between me

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.130
and room C02?

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.460
I don't know either.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.170
That helped me out a lot.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:50.920
You should see it for yourself.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.290
Alan.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.880
Hurry up.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.170
You think that's a human?

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.170
I think so.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:04.830
Mister?

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.790
Sir?

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.290
Sir?

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.790
Alan?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.290
Do you know who I am?

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.670
Do you know him?

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920
No.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.670
Why does he seem
to recognize me?

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.830
Mister

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.880
what's your disease?

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.880
Sir.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.920
We need to go now.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.880
Someone will come, hurry.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.880
How's the patient condition?

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.670
What about the heart rate?

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:53.750
Alright.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.170
Do it again.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.920
Draw more.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.710
That's so cute.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.170
Amazing.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.880
Pete.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.750
We have to talk.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.130
What is it, Doc?

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.130
Haven't I told you

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.460
not to randomly talk
with the patients?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Just a moment ago, you
made a promise to me,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.460
and now you've broken it.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.460
What were you
talking about with him?

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.630
Why are you
nitpicking me so much?

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.830
I was chatting
about everyday stuff.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.040
Nothing about
the patient at all.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.420
Did you

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.420
not get enough sleep again?

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:42.790
No.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:44.960
I don't think so.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.250
Your eyes look really tired.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.460
My house is far away,

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.670
so traveling back and forth

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:51.880
requires a lot of time.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.630
Like today, I woke
up at four a.m.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.920
I only had five hours of sleep.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.500
Look,

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.380
there are apartments
available near the hospital.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.170
How come you didn't rent them?

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.420
Because living in my own
home is less expensive.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.040
Your house is that far away,

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.500
but I see you working
shifts every night.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.000
I've been saving money to
study for a master's degree.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.000
Which major?

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.000
Psychiatric nursing.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.170
Working night shifts

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.579
is one way for me to make money.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:19.670
So...

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.880
would you like to keep me
company on this night shift?

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.710
No can do.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.329
Tonight is Doctor Tukta's shift.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.880
Then

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.000
Do you have any tips for
getting rid of the sleepiness?

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.000
I've already had loads of coffee,

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.210
but that doesn't help.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.710
Tips for getting
rid of sleepiness?

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.080
There might be a way.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.210
Try doing jumping jacks.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:45.500
Huh?

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.880
Are you serious, doc?

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.880
Many people are nearby.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.540
Trust me.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.380
Give it a try.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.630
All right.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:56.250
One

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.170
Two

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:57.710
Three

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.500
Four

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.790
Doc,

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.040
you teased me, didn't you?

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.500
I've never thought

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.920
you'd be this gullible.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.630
Didn't you tell me

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.080
that the best way to rest

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:20.670
was to take a nap?

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.830
What the hell, doc.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.880
I trusted you, you know?

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.250
I'm going to find a spot to nap then.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.210
You're really asking for it, huh?

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.670
If I find you dozing off again,

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.290
I'll report to Doctor Nil.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.500
I'm leaving now.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.210
Too lazy to argue with you.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.790
Guess who.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.380
I've heard your bell ringing

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.880
since you walked into this room.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.130
You still playing this as a grown-up?

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.210
Watch your mouth.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.670
Mouth flick!

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:22.290
Want some more?

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.790
Hey, Tukta.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:30.880
I have something to ask.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.960
What?

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.670
Well

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.500
I have to go home this week.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:39.790
And

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.710
you're working
tonight's shift, right?

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.040
Yeah.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.130
What about it?

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.330
You're going to
ask for a shift trade?

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.920
Can I?

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.580
And now, out of the blue,

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.170
you're pleading with me?

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.210
Moron.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.830
Tukta.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.500
Here he comes.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.330
Here comes my friend.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:03.630
Please

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.750
pretty lady Tukta.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.420
The prettiest person

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.460
in this hospital.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.080
Help a friend out.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.080
Alright.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.830
What a precious friend I am,

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.420
you know it.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.080
True!

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.540
I never turn down my friends.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.580
I really appreciate it.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.790
For this favor you've done for me,

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:36.630
I shall be ungrateful.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.580
Alright.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.460
No trading then.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.210
Just kidding.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.380
But wait.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.080
I think this behavior of yours

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.330
is very familiar to me.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.920
I figured it out.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.130
The behavior of asking a friend for help

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.460
to skip group project
and go on a date instead.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.210
Don't tell me.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.250
You think I don't know
what you're up to?

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:13.290
You better tell me

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.130
who that doctor is.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.170
Tell me everything right now.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.540
I said I'm going back home.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.290
You're goddamn nosy!

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.790
You're swearing now?

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.500
You only swear when
you're embarrased.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.290
Want me to guess?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.460
Your favorite type

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.880
have never escaped my keen eyes.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.540
Who could he be?

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.880
Pete the new nurse, right?

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.580
I actually guessed right!

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.330
Just smile.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.000
Admit it, you're embarrased.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.920
Quit it.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:06.040
How did it start?

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.500
You're not stopping
with the questions.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.290
You can go now.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.420
Shy?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Shy.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.960
Shy.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:15.710
Go!

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:16.830
Smiling?

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.830
Shoo!

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.790
I'll go, alright.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.290
You're no longer
of any use to me!

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.210
But only on one condition.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.130
And that is?

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.750
You must come back and tell me

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.170
how everything went

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.130
on your date.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.250
Okay?

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.290
Nothing's gonna happen.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.080
Just go away.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:41.670
Sure?

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:43.170
- Yeah.
- Sure.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:44.170
Move it.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.960
Somebody can't keep it together.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.210
Go!

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:51.210
Alright, whatever.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.670
Don't forget our agreement.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.420
Alright, buddy?

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.500
So hot.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.580
Wanna sit here?

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.250
It's kinda hot.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.670
Have you note things down today?

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.080
You're probably
gonna forget me again.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.670
I haven't.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.630
Then write it down
now, I'll sit here with you.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.330
Hey, you don't have to.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.670
I'm fine being alone.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.540
Wouldn't want to bore you.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.130
I never get bored

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:47.790
looking at your face.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.580
Idiot.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:55.880
Stop teasing me.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:00.380
Write it down.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:01.330
Okay.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.750
May I sit there with you?

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.540
It's you, Si.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:15.460
Sure.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.460
Have a seat.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.580
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.210
No worries,

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.830
I'm not doing anything.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.790
Si.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.710
This is Win.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.460
Win.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.420
Si.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:42.750
Have you seen each
other's faces before?

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:48.750
Of course I have.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.380
I've been here for a long time.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:53.830
Okay.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:57.170
Oh, Chess.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.380
I've been wanting to play chess.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.460
Alan.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.960
Care to play a game
of chess with me?

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.250
Chess?

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.920
That's right.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.380
Chess.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.750
Why do you ask me
to play all of a sudden?

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.250
You don't want to play?

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:20.790
It's not like that.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.420
Well

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.750
I'm just not sure
how the game works.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.290
Then it wouldn't
hurt to try out, right?

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.130
I'm not very good at it either.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.420
Just wanted to
practice my skills.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:37.170
Please?

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.250
You should try.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.540
There's nothing
better to do anyway.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:46.830
Maybe

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.750
it might help you

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.170
get some of your memories back.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:53.960
Alright.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:55.670
Let's give it a try.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.290
But do not expect
too much from me.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.540
Good players

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.330
usually say something
humble like this all the time.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.670
You're not sure?

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:27.790
Yes.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.880
What are you hesitant about?

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.540
I

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
just don't know

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:37.080
how to move them.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.830
Try moving the pieces
based on your sensations

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.500
and instincts.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.210
What if I made the wrong move?

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.880
Then simply restart a new game.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.540
There's nothing to fear.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:02.460
Okay.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.420
Not a terrible start.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.170
He left out of the blue
without saying anything.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:31.500
When a person
is falling in love,

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.210
it is easy to tell.

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:42.250
What falling in love, Si?

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.420
It's not like that.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.290
It's not?

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.130
Are you sure

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.880
that it's not?

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.540
I'm not exactly sure.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.500
I just think

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.380
it can't be that easy.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.500
What is it

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.080
that's not easy?

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.130
To fall in love with somebody.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.420
I think it couldn't
happen that easily.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.580
Alan.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.920
When we fall in love with someone,

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.580
even though we've just met them,

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.460
they'll unexpectedly come into our lives,

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.580
and next thing we know,

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:32.130
we'll find ourselves in
the midst of a love forest.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:35.670
Just like that.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.960
So easily.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.000
Yeah.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.290
You need to ask yourself

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.750
whether or not you're
feeling that way.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:55.170
Checkmate.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.710
I've beaten you, Si.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.330
You're pretty good at this.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.380
If I

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.040
were to ask for permission

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.540
to call you

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.920
"Boss",

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.380
would that be acceptable?

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.880
You are showing
me too much respect.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.000
Not at all.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:22.290
Come on.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.580
Please?

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.420
Of course.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:27.330
Whatever you like.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.290
Okay.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.880
Thank you so much.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:36.040
Boss.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.920
When we realize

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.790
we're falling in
love with someone,

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.630
don't let the opportunity go.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:48.630
One thing

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.500
that a person in love tends
to make a mistake about

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.880
is letting that opportunity go.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.000
Please keep that in mind, Boss.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:01.920
I will.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.960
Thank you, Si.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.250
Alan.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.080
Time for Doctor
Nil's appointment.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:16.330
Alright.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:18.710
Then,

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.080
If you'll excuse me, Si.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:21.830
Of course.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.790
Be seeing you.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.500
Okay.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.880
Let's go, Alan.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:42.880
Try putting both your arms up.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.500
All the way up.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:51.630
You can put them down now.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.380
Now, try closing your eyes.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:57.330
Close your eyes.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.880
Then, touch your nose
with the right index finger .

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:07.130
Move your body naturally.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:08.960
No need to slow down or rush it.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:16.920
Alright.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.000
Now, try switching to
using your left hand.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.920
Put the left index finger on
your nose in the same way.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.880
Alright.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.540
You can open your eyes now.

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:34.630
Now repeat after me.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:38.130
Grandma took her grandchild
to buy sweets at the market.

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:41.330
Grandma

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.460
took her grandchild
to buy sweets

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.920
at the market.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.380
Okay.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.540
I have some goodnews for you.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.420
Your C.T. scan result

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.210
hasn't shown anything abnormal.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:10.580
No Ischemic stroke.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:11.960
No hemorrhagic stroke.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.880
And no tumor found.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.330
I believe we have
some additional relief.

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:22.790
This means

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.170
I'm cured

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.500
and can return
home now, right Doc?

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.040
A physical examination

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.250
cannot provide
complete information.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:37.420
To diagnose

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.000
and determine whether or not
the condition's been resolved or not

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.710
is actually more up to
how the patient feels.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.380
So

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.420
If I feel like I'm recovered,

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.290
does this mean I
can go home now?

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.670
If you think you're recovered,

00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.540
may I show you this?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.710
Are you still afraid, Alan?

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.420
Yes.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:20.710
Can you tell me one more
time that you're recovered?

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:27.040
I don't know.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:36.790
Alan.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.830
The primary issue of yours

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.920
is the fear.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.420
What do we do when we get scared?

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:49.710
I don't know.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.080
I'll tell you a secret.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.920
At the end of fear,
there is nothing.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:00.080
Fear is the dead end,

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:03.130
nothing else more than that.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.420
Then

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.080
what do I have to do
to get over my fear?

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.670
A solution to deal with fear

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:14.420
is very simple.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.290
Embrace your fear to the fullest.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:19.920
Fear it

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.080
until we realize that

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.460
no matter how much we fear it

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.000
and how hard it tries to scare us,

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.750
there is nothing more
than fear in the end.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.960
Nothing else.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.500
Right?

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.040
Try to think about
what I said, alright?

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.460
Okay.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.460
That's all I have for you today.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.210
You can get some rest.

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:57.790
Okay.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:35.670
Hey!

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.250
What's wrong with you?

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.250
What did Doctor Nil said?

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.420
He said

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:43.330
there's nothing wrong with me,

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:45.420
but I still haven't
gotten better.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.250
I'm not sure if that
was good or bad.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.290
Well

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.040
let's just that was a good news.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.080
Let's go on a little trip.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:53.750
Where?

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:54.790
Come on.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.290
Hurry.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:01.290
Quicker.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.040
Wait.

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.790
Are we really going to
walk in here like this?

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:07.250
Why?

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:09.210
Don't tell me you're
scared of ghosts.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:10.750
Yeah, that too.

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:13.420
But wouldn't our presence here

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:15.170
disturb them?

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:17.750
Disturb who?

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.250
The dead.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.080
Don't you ever think

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.710
that maybe they're
waiting for us to visit?

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.290
My thought is that

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:29.830
a dead person and an alive
person aren't really different.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.080
How are they not different?

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.880
Well

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.420
They probably share the same
feelings of loneliness or nostalgia,

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:39.830
don't you think?

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:41.250
I guess.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.830
Why did the writing

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.830
on the gravestones
here fade so much?

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.960
Like I said,

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.630
no one has visited
and tended them.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.460
The feeling of fear I had

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.210
has now turned into
loneliness instead.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.250
I want to apologize
to you for something.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.040
I still feel bad

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.000
that I took you to see that
nurse's photo the other day

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:20.960
and something went wrong.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.330
It's fine.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.380
You don't have
to think about it.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.630
But I have to admit,

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:28.830
I was really scared.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.460
Sorry.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.130
Even knowing that you
were scared of ghosts,

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.080
I still brought you there.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:40.750
Actually,

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.920
I wasn't scared of ghosts.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.380
Then was there
something else scarier?

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.670
If you trust me,

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.710
everything will come
to an end with me

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.420
and right now.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.630
Consider this place your safe spot.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.080
And I'm also your "safe person."

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:26.710
You are now free to talk
about anything right now.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:31.960
I was scared I
would get murdered.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.460
Murdered?

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.500
Who would have done that?

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:39.250
I don't know.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.750
Might be the old man ghost

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.920
or the nurse ghost.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:46.750
I had fallen

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.170
into a depth of horror,

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.330
then my dad called me insane

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:53.080
and abandoned me here.

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:55.830
You were scared of being
abandoned too, right?

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.960
I was more scared of being forgotten.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.830
You were the one who told me

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.290
this place was the
hospital of the forgotten.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.540
I've wanted to
ask you for a while.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.750
Why did you call this place
the hospital of the forgotten?

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:25.130
Because we've been forgotten,

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.290
that's why we still remain here.

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.460
When we are forgotten for a long time,

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.170
one day, we'll eventually lose track

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:38.830
of who

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:41.210
we really are.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.500
Sometimes I feel like

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.420
we're no different than the
dead people in this cemetery.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.290
How?

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.210
Our loneliness is no different

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:05.170
from that of a
forgotten dead person.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.670
Perhaps if we die from
someone's memory,

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.330
we will cease to exist.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:22.830
But

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.500
we're existing now.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.540
Our flesh and
bones are still intact.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.540
Being alive and existing

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.710
are not the same thing.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:38.750
Do you know

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.830
what
keeps our existence going.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:45.130
What is it?

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:46.710
Memories.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.000
When we're able to remain
in someone's memory,

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.880
that's when we
know we're existing.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:57.500
However,

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:00.880
If nobody remembers us one day,

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.830
we are no different
from the dead.

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:12.670
Hey.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:16.830
You're existing to me.

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:19.500
How so?

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.750
You're right here at
the moment with me,

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:25.040
in my memory.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.250
Even if I'm sometimes forgetful,

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.250
I'll always write
things about you

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.750
down in my journal,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.880
and then I'll
remember you instantly.

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:39.380
See?

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:42.290
You'll always exist to me.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:45.790
Then

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.630
I'm no longer like the dead, right?

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.750
How could you be dead

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.500
now that you're
already in my memory?

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.380
And you'll always be there.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.630
I must go all out.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:05.920
Let's go!

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:12.080
Doc!

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:13.290
Doc.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:17.460
What's with you.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.210
Didn't you tell me not to slack off?

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.960
Take a good look at yourself!

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.710
Sleep like a baby.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:32.420
I wasn't slacking off.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.710
All I did was take
a refreshing nap.

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:37.790
Lazy means lazy, Doc.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.000
Don't try to deny it.

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:42.330
I wasn't being lazy.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.210
I was just getting some rest

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:45.500
for tonight.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:48.710
I have a night shift
with you tonight.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:52.080
I thought you said tonight
was Dr.Tukta's shift.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:54.920
I've traded with her.

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:57.460
What?

00:43:58.290 --> 00:43:59.290
Don't you

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:02.040
want to work the
night shift with me?

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.880
It's not like that.

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.630
I was just being curious.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:09.750
Well...

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:13.750
I...

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.420
Just forget it.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:21.330
I saw that you're a newbie,

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:24.080
so, in case you run
into any problems,

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:25.250
I can offer you an advice.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.960
Alright.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:30.460
But...

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:32.250
about tonight,

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:40.580
I didn't bring
enough sandwiches.

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.080
What are you going to eat then?

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.880
That's what you're
worried about?

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.880
I'm not going to
steal your food.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.540
Feel free to eat them.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:54.540
Are you sure?

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.040
Last time,

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.920
who was scavenging the
fridge in the middle of the night?

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.080
Just eat.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:05.170
I won't take your food anymore.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:06.290
Okay?

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:07.330
Alright.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.250
I'll be sure to provoke
you while I eat.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:12.790
I gotta go.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.960
see you tonight, Doc.

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.580
So

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:43.170
Which one's your room?

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.880
I'll swing by there
in my free time.

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:48.130
It's okay.

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:49.170
I don't wanna bother you.

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.540
Want me to walk you to your room?

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:58.750
Are you having naughty thoughts?

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:01.710
What naughty?

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:03.540
Go back to your room now.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.960
You're blushing?

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:07.710
I'm not blushing.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:10.130
Go on.

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:11.790
See ya.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.130
Hello, Mr.Alan.

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:46.710
Hello, Mr.Alan.

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:55.330
Hello, Mr.Alan.
