00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:04.208
Enaga.

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.500
You asked me before
if I had an idol I liked, right?

00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:08.250
Yeah, I did.

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:23.083
Well...

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:28.667
My favorite idol is AE.

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.500
Wow...

00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:39.375
Oh, so that's who it is.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.083
What's with that lackluster response?

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:42.792
You already knew, didn't you?

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:48.708
I haven't told anyone in class.

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.250
But I guess it's fine if you know.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.042
Oh...

00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:58.000
Yeah.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:02.167
Make yourself at home. I'll get some tea.

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:17.625
Thanks.

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:29.667
It's so weird, like I'm staring at myself.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.458
Um...

00:01:34.993 --> 00:01:37.451
Can I gush about my bias now?

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.500
Yeah.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.042
Look! That face he's making...
I love him so much!

00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:49.167
Oh...

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:51.128
It's the look in his eyes!
That's the best part.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.250
And I love the way he walks, too.

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:56.333
He absolutely lights up the runway.

00:01:56.458 --> 00:01:58.167
All eyes are on him.

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:00.292
Are you listening?

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.250
Yeah, I'm listening.

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:05.875
He looks amazing in this photo, too.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.760
- You're making me blush.
- I even tried to copy this outfit of his...

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:10.500
by saving up money.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.333
Your whole face lights up
when you talk about him.

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:20.875
I've always just kept this to myself.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.375
This is the first time I've been able to talk
about my bias with someone. I'm so happy.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.833
It feels so good to talk about your bias!

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:33.208
That's good.

00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:39.333
All this talk about my
bias has made me hungry.

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:40.667
Should we eat?

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:43.000
Enaga, are you okay with
eating home-cooked food?

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:59.500
Wow! Did you make all this?

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:00.917
Yeah.

00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:03.125
Wow, you're on top of things.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.458
Well, you have to when you live alone.

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:07.542
So, want to eat?

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:08.917
Yes.

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:11.458
You got it. I'll get things ready.

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:35.592
"PUNKS△TRIANGLE"
(Episode 5)

00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:24.583
Let's eat.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.583
Whoa, this is amazing.

00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:39.875
Really?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.375
Yeah, it's really good.

00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:54.750
Are you playing with your beans?

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:59.542
No, this bean keeps getting away from me.

00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:03.083
Are you that clumsy?
Here, let me get it for you.

00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:08.000
Here you go.

00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:11.750
Hey, are you feeding me?

00:05:15.792 --> 00:05:17.292
One more.

00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:20.375
Here.

00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:25.542
It feels like I'm feeding a pet.

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:27.083
Feeding a pet?

00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:30.000
You kind of look like a
bird right now.

00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:32.601
Since your name is Enaga...
[homophone for a type of bird in Japan]

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:33.625
Huh?

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.333
It's nothing...

00:05:35.458 --> 00:05:37.417
Try this, too.

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:38.875
Okay.

00:05:39.917 --> 00:05:41.083
Here.

00:05:43.917 --> 00:05:47.167
Mmm, this is good, too.

00:05:47.542 --> 00:05:48.958
Really?

00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:53.292
It's hard to describe... the flavors
are so delicate, so thoughtful.

00:05:53.417 --> 00:05:54.542
You're exaggerating.

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:59.500
Not at all. It just reminded me of
that dress you made in our first year.

00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:01.458
Huh?

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.125
You mean that one...

00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:15.292
Your usual clothes are pretty edgy,
just like you...

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:19.333
But that one was a
total surprise. I loved it.

00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:27.917
I actually don't like that dress very much.

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:30.458
Huh, why?

00:06:32.708 --> 00:06:35.417
Because it looks too much like
a dress my mom used to wear.

00:06:35.542 --> 00:06:38.125
She left home.

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:48.250
I just wanted to see if I could replicate
the stitching of a manufactured garment.

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:51.167
That's why I chose a really simple design.

00:06:53.042 --> 00:06:57.750
It wasn't until I finished that I realized how
much it looked like hers. I grew to hate it.

00:06:58.167 --> 00:06:59.375
Sorry.

00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:01.708
It's fine.

00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:05.125
They got divorced.

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:09.417
But the thing that I can't forgive...

00:07:10.583 --> 00:07:15.375
is that they never told me the truth.
They kept me in the dark the whole time.

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:23.000
I just want the people close
to me... to not keep secrets.

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:32.542
My mom had an affair.
My dad knew all along.

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:36.458
They'd already fallen
apart long before that.

00:07:45.708 --> 00:07:47.833
Today was so much fun!

00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:54.417
We have to come back next year!

00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:55.750
Okay, let's do it.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.042
Again.

00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:08.333
Mom?

00:08:08.458 --> 00:08:10.333
Where are you going?

00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:13.833
Mom?

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:30.125
It's fine. It was already torn.

00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:35.535
I was completely oblivious.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.167
Until the moment she left.

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:44.292
I didn't suspect a thing.

00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:48.583
Those happy times.

00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:51.625
THe happy memories...

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:59.125
The moment I realized it
was all a lie... it hurt so much.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
It was devastating.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.958
I never want to feel that way again.

00:09:31.542 --> 00:09:37.458
But it was because I didn't want to
be at home that I went to that show.

00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:41.708
And that's how I discovered
AE and found a dream.

00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:43.542
I guess it was a blessing in disguise.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.167
A dream?

00:09:49.083 --> 00:09:51.792
Since we're friends now,
I'll tell you.

00:09:53.708 --> 00:09:55.458
My dream...

00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:59.833
is for AE to wear my designs
on the runway.

00:10:01.708 --> 00:10:04.208
Having a dream... is a wonderful thing.

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:09.000
Just imagining my bias
wearing my designs...

00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:12.500
gives me the motivation
to get through each day.

00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:18.500
As long as I keep moving toward my dream...

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.958
all the painful stuff...
starts to fade into the past.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:31.042
That's my ulterior motive
for entering this competition.

00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:35.708
I see...

00:10:38.208 --> 00:10:42.083
Alright, eat up. We've got work to do.

00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:44.958
Mmm...

00:10:49.417 --> 00:10:52.292
I have a secret I'm keeping from him, too.

00:10:54.458 --> 00:10:57.500
The truth is... I'm AE.

00:11:10.583 --> 00:11:12.292
I just can't bring myself to tell him.

00:11:13.583 --> 00:11:17.958
I thought I could at least wait
until the competition was over.

00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:21.333
But even if I tell him
after the competition,

00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:28.250
wouldn't that be just like Chiaki's parents
keeping him in the dark?

00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:31.292
I never want to feel that way again.

00:11:37.333 --> 00:11:38.542
Ah!

00:11:40.792 --> 00:11:43.542
Hey! Are you hurt?

00:11:45.208 --> 00:11:47.167
It's nothing.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.292
Give me your hand.

00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.500
I'll disinfect it for you.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.292
Mmm... AE.

00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.292
There.

00:12:20.167 --> 00:12:21.458
Okay.

00:12:28.167 --> 00:12:30.417
Your hands are all scratched up.

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:32.458
And your skin is so dry.

00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.583
Wait a sec.

00:12:49.042 --> 00:12:52.958
Um... we just became friends.

00:12:53.083 --> 00:12:54.917
Isn't this a little too close?

00:12:57.167 --> 00:12:58.958
Your hands are so big.

00:13:01.417 --> 00:13:06.542
So this is Chiaki's scent.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.667
This clumsy side of you...
I'm starting to find it endearing.

00:13:10.792 --> 00:13:13.458
It's kind of pathetic how hard you try.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.958
You're actually pretty cute like this.

00:13:27.292 --> 00:13:31.542
He said I'm... cute?

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.667
He would never say something
like that to AE, would he?

00:13:41.875 --> 00:13:46.583
I put a bandage on you before, didn't I?

00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:52.542
You did. You were a total jerk about it.

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:56.667
Don't act all touched. What
have you been doing all year?

00:13:59.042 --> 00:14:02.042
Part of it was seeing
everyone as competition.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.118
And part of it was knowing that when you get
close to people, it hurts when you fall apart.

00:14:09.292 --> 00:14:13.167
To be honest, I never wanted
to get too close to anyone.

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:18.625
So at first, when they said
I had to team up with you,

00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:22.583
I thought that getting
involved with someone,

00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:26.208
especially a loser like
you, was the absolute worst.

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:29.000
But now... it's not so bad.

00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:33.167
Aside from you being
hopeless with your hands.

00:14:34.542 --> 00:14:36.292
Sorry.

00:14:37.083 --> 00:14:39.500
Don't be so serious.

00:14:40.868 --> 00:14:43.285
Come on. Let's get back to it.

00:14:58.167 --> 00:15:04.458
I don't want to make
things awkward between us.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.917
Done! That's it for today.

00:15:35.042 --> 00:15:38.083
How about you, Enaga?
Did you finish the appliqué?

00:15:40.417 --> 00:15:41.917
I guess so.

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:46.667
The rough texture is perfect. It's
got that 'bad but cute' vibe. I like it.

00:15:46.792 --> 00:15:48.583
Is that a compliment?

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.542
Alright, let's get some sleep.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.125
Can I sleep here?

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.125
What are you talking
about? We'll just share.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.375
The bed's a little small, so no complaints.

00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:06.875
Really?

00:16:18.458 --> 00:16:19.958
Well? Are you coming?

00:16:24.792 --> 00:16:26.458
Okay, then...

00:16:29.792 --> 00:16:31.542
Are you going to sleep with your hat on?

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:39.500
No... It's just a little embarrassing.
Can you turn off the lights?

00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:43.458
Okay.

00:17:10.125 --> 00:17:12.667
Is my wig going to get crooked...

00:17:13.042 --> 00:17:17.750
Wait, what if I lose control
and do something stupid?

00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:20.792
Saying he's embarrassed
and wants the lights off...

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:28.917
Does he have some crazy
bedhead under that hat?

00:17:30.458 --> 00:17:34.417
Whatever. I probably shouldn't pry.

00:17:35.042 --> 00:17:38.250
Why do I feel so weird?

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:43.458
When I'm AE, he just looks at me and...

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.292
he blushes like crazy then...

00:17:55.583 --> 00:17:59.625
I'm the only one he makes flustered.

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.625
Enaga.

00:18:06.708 --> 00:18:08.208
Are you asleep?

00:18:10.292 --> 00:18:12.750
Totally out.

00:18:18.042 --> 00:18:22.833
Well... what I'm about to say...

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.940
if you're asleep, you can
just pretend you didn't hear it.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:35.792
I've only met AE twice.

00:18:40.917 --> 00:18:45.500
I was so nervous.

00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.167
But AE was super nice.

00:18:55.375 --> 00:19:00.542
He was practically glowing, like something
out of a dream. It made me so happy.

00:19:07.042 --> 00:19:09.292
The second time we met...

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:12.458
It's kind of a blur.

00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:18.583
I think I drank too much and
ended up throwing up in front of him.

00:19:23.708 --> 00:19:25.792
From that day on

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:31.083
he stopped replying to my messages.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:39.667
Did I do something wrong?

00:19:45.375 --> 00:19:47.708
Did I say something out of line...

00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:58.875
and not even realize it?

00:20:03.792 --> 00:20:05.458
I'm sorry.

00:20:06.833 --> 00:20:09.417
I shouldn't be dumping all this on you.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.458
If... we win the competition...

00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:42.583
do you think I'll get to see AE again
at the fashion show?

00:21:21.583 --> 00:21:26.333
Huh? That smell... perfume and cigarettes.

00:21:27.542 --> 00:21:29.958
Oh, Enaga.

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:35.292
Did I wake you? Sorry about that.

00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:37.833
Heading out?

00:21:38.208 --> 00:21:39.750
Off to work.

00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:42.542
It's fine, you can go back to sleep.

00:21:43.042 --> 00:21:44.792
Thanks. You were a huge help yesterday.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.542
I'll make you breakfast. Eat before you go.

00:21:47.667 --> 00:21:50.583
Don't worry about it. I'll just grab
something at the convenience store.

00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:53.667
You need to eat a proper breakfast.

00:21:53.792 --> 00:21:55.833
You'll make me worry!

00:21:58.167 --> 00:22:01.667
Just sit down. It'll only take a minute.

00:22:02.542 --> 00:22:05.083
Alright, fine.

00:22:16.583 --> 00:22:18.458
Time to dig in!

00:22:26.208 --> 00:22:27.625
Um...

00:22:29.375 --> 00:22:32.292
About last night...
before we went to sleep.

00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:33.792
Do you remember any of it?

00:22:33.917 --> 00:22:35.542
Remember what?

00:22:35.667 --> 00:22:38.042
Sorry, I was half asleep.

00:22:39.125 --> 00:22:40.792
Oh. Good.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.958
That was delicious. Thanks.

00:22:50.083 --> 00:22:51.542
I'll wash the dishes before I leave.

00:22:51.667 --> 00:22:54.458
No way! You'd probably just break them.

00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:56.625
Hurry up, or you'll be late for work.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.667
Thanks again, really.

00:23:14.833 --> 00:23:16.250
Sumiura.

00:23:16.375 --> 00:23:18.083
Yeah?

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:33.417
Let's win this thing together.

00:23:35.833 --> 00:23:38.708
Yeah. Okay.

00:23:54.125 --> 00:23:56.292
Wait! He totally remembers!

00:23:56.417 --> 00:23:58.625
He wiped away my tears.

00:24:01.625 --> 00:24:06.042
Damn it, why did my
heart flutter like that...?

00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:16.958
Ah... I can still smell Enaga's scent...

00:24:23.458 --> 00:24:28.667
Chiaki always acts so cheerful,

00:24:31.333 --> 00:24:34.208
but I'm sure it's bothering him deep down.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:43.333
For now, I just have to
focus on the competition.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.183
(Next Episode) Hey! Aren't you going to
apologize for what happened?

00:24:51.208 --> 00:24:52.875
Do you know what a "love hotel" is?

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.375
What? Nude photos of Hoshino?

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.208
Give me something to remember you by.

00:24:56.333 --> 00:24:58.268
When you say you like me,
do you mean it... that way?

00:24:58.292 --> 00:25:00.375
Even now, I can still feel you.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.958
Is this okay? I'm coming in.

00:25:05.208 --> 00:25:09.333
