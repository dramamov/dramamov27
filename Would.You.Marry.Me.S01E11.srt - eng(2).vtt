I'd seen her somewhere.

00:12:41.074 --> 00:12:42.408
[bailiff] Please be seated.

00:12:45.787 --> 00:12:47.747
We'll begin the trial.

00:12:48.623 --> 00:12:51.918
Case number 2025-KO-182.

00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:54.128
I'll read the sentence.

00:12:54.212 --> 00:12:55.463
Defendant Jang Hangu

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.592
planned a long-term con
to take control of Myungsoondang.

00:13:00.093 --> 00:13:03.137
He put together
a 30-billion-won investment fraud.

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:08.893
In the process, he illegally obtained
Kim Miyeon's Hawaii property,

00:13:08.976 --> 00:13:12.188
used J Consulting to embezzle funds,

00:13:12.271 --> 00:13:14.774
and conspired
with Oh Minjeong and David Lee

00:13:14.857 --> 00:13:18.736
to deceive the victim
with a forged Kaltz Hotel contract,

00:13:19.237 --> 00:13:22.740
hereby causing grievous monetary loss.

00:13:22.824 --> 00:13:26.327
We also acknowledge that he turned
the fraud victim into the assailant,

00:13:26.994 --> 00:13:29.247
damaging Myungsoondang's credibility,

00:13:29.872 --> 00:13:33.584
brand image,
and obstructing their business.

00:13:33.668 --> 00:13:35.002
Take this.

00:13:35.086 --> 00:13:36.212
The chairwoman gave it to me.

00:13:36.295 --> 00:13:37.922
-I had too many.
-[judge] In addition to that,

00:13:38.005 --> 00:13:42.468
to murder Ko Seongtae, who found
J Consulting's padded account ledger,

00:13:42.552 --> 00:13:45.179
he paid his driver, Lee Janghun,
to commit murder.

00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:48.224
He also conspired
with Lee Janghun and Oh Minjeong

00:13:48.307 --> 00:13:52.812
to poison Ko Philnyun multiple times.

00:13:54.772 --> 00:13:56.315
Finally, in around 2009,

00:13:56.816 --> 00:14:00.278
the statute of limitations on the charges
of a hit-and-run resulting in bodily harm

00:14:00.361 --> 00:14:03.531
and bribery expired,
and he can no longer be prosecuted.

00:14:03.614 --> 00:14:08.494
However, he fled abroad
to avoid criminal prosecution,

00:14:08.995 --> 00:14:11.581
and that's serious enough
to extend the statute.

00:14:11.664 --> 00:14:14.041
In July 27, 2000,

00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:16.460
the defendant conspired
with accomplice Oh Minjeong

00:14:16.544 --> 00:14:20.131
and murdered Kim Useok and Lee Eunyeong
in a car crash disguised as an accident.

00:14:20.756 --> 00:14:23.885
Under ordinary circumstances, the statute
of limitations would've expired,

00:14:23.968 --> 00:14:28.931
but the court will discount the time
the defendant fled abroad,

00:14:29.015 --> 00:14:31.350
and that means he can be prosecuted.

00:14:32.768 --> 00:14:36.397
Based on the accomplice's confession
and the objective evidence,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.359
the court finds him guilty of the murder
of Kim Useok and Lee Eunyeong.

00:14:40.443 --> 00:14:42.445
-[spectators gasp]
-No!

00:14:42.528 --> 00:14:43.946
No way!

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.573
-That's nonsense!
-[judge] In conclusion,

00:14:45.656 --> 00:14:47.700
the defendant committed fraud,

00:14:47.783 --> 00:14:50.286
embezzlement, dereliction of duty,
obstruction of business,

00:14:50.369 --> 00:14:52.788
conspiracy to murder and murder.

00:14:52.872 --> 00:14:54.457
The nature of the crime
is extremely egregious,

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.459
and its social harm is substantial.

00:14:56.542 --> 00:14:59.253
Accordingly, this court hereby grants
Jang Hangu, the defendant

00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:01.923
the death penalty.

00:15:02.506 --> 00:15:03.883

You know, Mom.

00:15:28.407 --> 00:15:30.618
I couldn't go to court today.

00:15:33.079 --> 00:15:35.289
I didn't think I could face him.

00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:38.251
He ruined our family

00:15:39.543 --> 00:15:41.462
and killed Useok.

00:15:42.088 --> 00:15:46.092
I should beat him to death
for what he did to you on top of that.

[♪ soft melancholy music playing]

How did he manage to dupe me
for all those years?

I didn't know what he was doing
so I whined and pestered you.

00:16:18.332 --> 00:16:21.794

Yes.

00:17:29.779 --> 00:17:31.906
[Useok] You were a cheeky boy
who wanted to do so many things.

00:17:32.448 --> 00:17:36.285
It made me sad to see you
huddled up in a corner.

00:17:39.622 --> 00:17:41.749
You got out of the long tunnel

I'm proud of you.

00:17:46.879 --> 00:17:47.963

I don't think we can accept

We're not actually a married couple.

My ex and I had agreed to divorce
around the time I won the unit.

I didn't want to lose out on the prize,

00:21:00.114 --> 00:21:05.244
so I brought him to claim it with me
instead of a real husband.

[Kim Wooju] We had
many opportunities to come clean,

and for breaking the contract.

I don't know. He didn't seem surprised.

You know he has a straight face.

00:21:42.907 --> 00:21:44.783
He'll talk to his people
and get back to us.

I'll move into Sori's studio apartment
and share the rent.

00:22:01.842 --> 00:22:02.968
Isn't that too far?

It's a short ride on the subway.

00:25:42.187 --> 00:25:44.982
Keep your mouth shut.

00:25:45.065 --> 00:25:46.441
"Keep your mouth shut."

00:25:47.109 --> 00:25:48.485
My head's ringing.

00:25:48.569 --> 00:25:49.653
"My head's ringing."

00:25:51.905 --> 00:25:53.615
Don't repeat what we all heard.

00:25:54.324 --> 00:25:55.784
Come on, Mom.

00:25:55.868 --> 00:25:57.244
[all chuckling]

00:25:57.327 --> 00:25:58.871
[♪ soft, gentle music playing]

00:26:12.885 --> 00:26:14.011
[Meri over phone] What, really?

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.388
That's such a relief.

00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:19.141
Everyone says she was incredibly lucky.

00:26:20.225 --> 00:26:23.270
[sighs] My eyes teared up
when she woke up.

00:26:24.229 --> 00:26:25.564
I almost cried.

00:26:26.106 --> 00:26:27.983
You're a crybaby.

00:26:29.109 --> 00:26:31.445
We can have dinner some other time.

00:26:31.528 --> 00:26:33.530
You should be with her today.

00:26:33.614 --> 00:26:34.656
[Kim Wooju] Okay.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.117
You can visit
once she regains some energy.

00:26:39.036 --> 00:26:40.078
Bye.

00:26:45.125 --> 00:26:46.126
[sighs in relief]

00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:52.257
Wooju.

00:26:57.554 --> 00:26:58.597
So... [clears throat]

00:27:02.517 --> 00:27:03.560
My husband...

00:27:05.854 --> 00:27:06.897
I mean...

00:27:07.356 --> 00:27:09.816
That fool.
The money he stole from the company.

00:27:10.943 --> 00:27:14.154
I'll get it back from him somehow.

00:27:15.322 --> 00:27:17.241
Give me a little time.

00:27:18.158 --> 00:27:21.828
Before that,
you should look after yourself first.

00:27:23.163 --> 00:27:25.165
Eungsoo has been really worried.

00:27:25.248 --> 00:27:27.542
He says you barely sleep at night.

00:27:34.341 --> 00:27:36.093
[sniffles] Well, that...

00:27:36.176 --> 00:27:37.302
[chuckles softly]

00:27:37.386 --> 00:27:40.180
That's because I'm menopausal.

00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:46.687
I don't have the right to complain
or say I'm having a hard time around you.

00:27:47.312 --> 00:27:50.273
I could make no excuses
even if I had extra mouths to speak with.

00:27:54.152 --> 00:27:56.071
You didn't know about it, either.

00:28:02.577 --> 00:28:03.662
I'm sorry, Wooju. [crying]

00:28:03.745 --> 00:28:05.497
[♪ soft, melancholy music playing]

00:28:05.956 --> 00:28:12.212
I gave you such a hard time,
and I left you alone for so long.

00:28:13.547 --> 00:28:15.424
There's no turning back time.

00:28:16.258 --> 00:28:20.554
If you don't want to see me ever again,

00:28:20.637 --> 00:28:22.597
we don't have to. [sniffles]

00:28:22.931 --> 00:28:25.600
If you don't want to call me "Auntie,"
then don't, okay?

00:28:25.684 --> 00:28:26.727
Until...

00:28:27.853 --> 00:28:32.107
Until you no longer feel resentful,
you can do whatever you want.

00:28:33.066 --> 00:28:34.109
Auntie.

00:28:35.944 --> 00:28:39.072
Just be there for me as you always were.

00:28:40.198 --> 00:28:42.951
I have no more family if I lose you, too.

00:28:45.579 --> 00:28:46.663
Wooju... [sobbing]

00:29:04.306 --> 00:29:05.348
[sniffles]

00:29:09.811 --> 00:29:11.563
[whistling]

00:29:13.023 --> 00:29:14.107
[in English] Okay.

00:29:17.069 --> 00:29:18.111
[in Korean] The plates.

00:29:18.528 --> 00:29:20.280
[in sing-song voice]
Everything must be straightened out.

00:29:20.864 --> 00:29:23.325
Lay out the plates.

00:29:23.408 --> 00:29:25.410
SEJUNG

00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:27.162
[exclaims]

00:29:29.247 --> 00:29:31.208
Hey, Sejung. Are you nearby?

00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:32.334
Yes.

00:29:33.293 --> 00:29:34.377
[Wonseok] Where are you?

00:29:36.296 --> 00:29:37.380
We're at the supermarket.

00:29:37.464 --> 00:29:38.799
The supermarket?

00:29:38.882 --> 00:29:40.884
-Do you need anything?
-You don't need to shop.

00:29:40.967 --> 00:29:44.304
Hey, it's a housewarming.
We can't go empty-handed.

00:29:44.596 --> 00:29:45.639
Drinks.

00:29:46.515 --> 00:29:47.516
Do you have drinks?

00:29:48.391 --> 00:29:49.726
Oh, really?

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.269
Okay, see you later, then.

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.190
Ms. Yoo said she'd get the alcohol.

00:29:55.273 --> 00:29:56.316
Oh, really?

00:29:56.942 --> 00:29:59.236
Should we get some toilet paper, then?

00:29:59.319 --> 00:30:00.362
-Sure.
-Where is it?

00:30:00.445 --> 00:30:01.488
It's over there.

00:30:01.863 --> 00:30:03.073
For his life to unravel well?

00:30:03.782 --> 00:30:06.368
-Shall we get some necessities?
-No, I'm sure he has enough.

00:30:06.451 --> 00:30:07.953
[♪ upbeat, whimsical music playing]

00:30:11.206 --> 00:30:12.666
That's a dreadful mix.

00:30:16.962 --> 00:30:17.963
[sighs]

00:30:20.465 --> 00:30:23.009
A box of peaches
on top of a box of grapes?

00:30:23.093 --> 00:30:25.262
Even numbers are always better than odd.

00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:26.388
What?

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.183
-This is too much.
-A guy

00:30:30.642 --> 00:30:33.186
who lives alone never buys fruit.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.313
But fruit goes bad really quickly.
[chuckles]

00:30:35.397 --> 00:30:37.190
He can't eat all this on his own.

00:30:37.274 --> 00:30:38.525
It's fine.

00:30:38.608 --> 00:30:39.860
This is a pineapple.

00:30:39.943 --> 00:30:42.404
It's not a cactus. Don't sit on it.
[chuckles]

00:30:42.904 --> 00:30:43.905
[chuckles awkwardly]

00:30:44.739 --> 00:30:47.159
Seriously, stop. That's more than enough.

00:30:47.242 --> 00:30:48.910
You buy way too much.

00:30:50.203 --> 00:30:51.246
Fine.

-Are you sulking?
-I'm not.

-You are sulking.
-I'm not.

00:31:03.258 --> 00:31:04.634
Okay, buy everything you want.

00:31:04.718 --> 00:31:05.760
Can I really?

00:31:06.678 --> 00:31:07.888
Don't we also need this?

We'll see them later anyway.

No, we can't. Not yet.

00:31:25.197 --> 00:31:27.532
I haven't told Songhee about us.

Why? Are you under a lot of stress?

Don't be like that.

her blind date didn't work out.

Right?

What?

[grunts] This won't do.

It's time to open the Door of Truth.
Mr. Han?

00:32:14.454 --> 00:32:15.497
Spin.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.874
Will you make some space in the center?

[Wonseok] Your question is,

00:32:30.345 --> 00:32:34.432
I'm stressed out
because of my blind date, yes or no?

00:32:35.976 --> 00:32:37.769
-No.
-See?

00:32:37.852 --> 00:32:39.479
-It's not the date.
-[Songhee] It's you.

00:32:39.562 --> 00:32:41.147
She didn't say it was because of me.

00:32:41.231 --> 00:32:42.482
[Wonseok] She might as well have.

00:32:42.565 --> 00:32:43.775
Okay, who's next?

[all mimicking drum roll]

00:33:26.526 --> 00:33:27.569
The answer is...

00:33:28.778 --> 00:33:29.821
I'll drink.

00:33:29.904 --> 00:33:32.073
-[Songhee] What?
-[Sejung] That's no fun.

00:33:32.157 --> 00:33:33.658
[Ms. Oh] That's not much of a secret.

-Come on.
-[Sejung] Ms. Yoo...

[Wonseok] I'm full from trying to keep up.

-[Sejung] It's Ms. Yoo again.
-Ms. Yoo!

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:18.411
Does this keep happening
because it's in the middle?

-No way.
-When was your most recent kiss?

00:34:22.665 --> 00:34:24.376
It was within the past week, yes or no?

[Sejung] That's it?

00:34:36.471 --> 00:34:38.306
Ms. Yoo, you're no fun.

00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:39.641
[Wonseok] She loves beer a lot.

00:34:40.225 --> 00:34:41.768
-Is this bottom's up?
-[Sejung] Bottom's up.

00:34:41.851 --> 00:34:44.104
-Bottom's up!
-[all] Bottom's up!

-[Ms. Oh] Mr. Kim can drink.
-[Wonseok] He's a heavy drinker.

00:35:00.995 --> 00:35:02.038
Mr. Kim.

00:35:04.499 --> 00:35:05.709
What's wrong?

00:35:05.792 --> 00:35:09.295
[inhales sharply] You pretended
to the very end not to have a boyfriend.

00:35:09.379 --> 00:35:12.549
That's because I haven't told Songhee yet.

00:35:12.632 --> 00:35:14.634
You kept hiding in the supermarket, too.

00:35:15.051 --> 00:35:17.137
Are you doing that
so you can go on blind dates?

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.764
[chuckles] No way. Don't be silly.

00:35:20.223 --> 00:35:21.599
Why can't you say, then?

00:35:21.683 --> 00:35:24.185
"This man is my man.
This person is my person."

00:35:24.269 --> 00:35:25.645
Why can't you say so?

00:35:25.729 --> 00:35:28.440
How can I say that this man is my man?

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:32.360
That he's so cute and so adorable
and that he drives me crazy?

00:35:32.444 --> 00:35:33.695
How can I say that?

00:35:33.778 --> 00:35:36.322
That would give everyone
the scare of a lifetime.

00:35:52.839 --> 00:35:54.132
I hurt my back. [clears throat]

00:35:54.841 --> 00:35:57.761
We saw it all already.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.641
Do you think this is enough?

00:36:03.725 --> 00:36:05.602
It'll last him three years.
That'll do. Let's go now.

00:36:08.396 --> 00:36:09.397

-Okay, buy everything you want.

Don't we also need this?

What are they doing?

00:36:19.199 --> 00:36:20.992
I think my heart is melting.

00:36:21.075 --> 00:36:22.494
What did I just witness?

-"Don't we also need this?"
-"Don't we also need this?"

00:36:31.377 --> 00:36:34.798
We played Truth or Dare
to see what you'd do.

00:36:35.799 --> 00:36:37.675
-[Meri] I feel humiliated.
-All that was on purpose?

[Ms. Oh] We caught you red-handed.

00:36:42.055 --> 00:36:44.057
You can't hide
from us any longer.

-Come in.
-Come in.

00:36:46.142 --> 00:36:47.811
That's not how I did it.

00:36:50.188 --> 00:36:51.231
Ms. Yoo.

Honestly.

How could you?

00:36:56.277 --> 00:36:58.571
You should've told me at least.

00:36:58.655 --> 00:37:02.575
I messed up the timing
because I wanted to tell you first.

00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:04.744
-Liar.
-It's the truth.

00:37:04.828 --> 00:37:07.163
Well, to be honest,

would've caught on.

Yes, Mom.

It's a dating show called I Am Single.

I met with the producers.

This is insane.

-They did make it obvious.
-[Wonseok] Pretty obvious.

[Sejung] When did it all begin?

00:37:55.211 --> 00:37:57.171
Was it since then?

00:37:57.255 --> 00:37:59.382
Our first team dinner?

00:37:59.632 --> 00:38:01.676
-Let's go.
-No, I think...

-No, it wasn't then.

at the photo studio.

Relax your face and smile a bit.

Yes.

00:50:41.644 --> 00:50:45.481
The owner once reported me for theft.

00:50:50.235 --> 00:50:54.073
She'd taken off her gold ring to work,
and it had disappeared.

00:50:54.156 --> 00:50:58.202
So, she searched all the kids' bags.

00:50:58.661 --> 00:50:59.703
The ring

00:51:00.496 --> 00:51:02.581
happened to be right by my feet.

00:51:06.543 --> 00:51:10.172
The thief had dropped it
so he wouldn't get caught.

00:51:10.255 --> 00:51:11.465
I was named

00:51:12.841 --> 00:51:13.926
as the thief.

00:51:14.009 --> 00:51:15.719
You were framed?

00:51:17.596 --> 00:51:18.639
I denied it was me.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:21.183
I said it wasn't.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.646
Just then, someone yelled from behind me.

00:51:27.439 --> 00:51:29.650
"He's an orphan."

00:51:30.567 --> 00:51:31.902
"He's from the orphanage."

00:51:35.447 --> 00:51:40.494
That's when everyone
started to call me a thief.

00:51:41.161 --> 00:51:42.162
I decided then

00:51:43.539 --> 00:51:45.124
that I should

00:51:47.251 --> 00:51:48.544
leave the orphanage.

00:51:51.547 --> 00:51:52.589
What then?

00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:54.800

The actual thief.

00:51:57.469 --> 00:51:59.179
I moved into his house.

00:51:59.722 --> 00:52:00.848
I kept my mouth shut.

00:52:02.099 --> 00:52:03.642
I took exams for him,

00:52:04.393 --> 00:52:06.520
and in return, I had a comfortable life.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.022
Sometimes...

00:52:10.315 --> 00:52:13.193

[sighs deeply]

00:52:20.534 --> 00:52:25.914
people stopped looking down on me.

00:52:27.249 --> 00:52:28.834
They didn't suspect me, either.

00:52:29.543 --> 00:52:30.586
So what now?

00:52:33.172 --> 00:52:34.548
Are you repaying the favor

00:52:35.841 --> 00:52:37.301
to the actual ring thief?

00:52:37.676 --> 00:52:38.719
Continuously?

00:52:39.928 --> 00:52:42.556
Why? For a comfortable life?

00:52:46.977 --> 00:52:49.480
I just don't want to go back
to how things were.

00:52:51.231 --> 00:52:53.859
Even so, you can't...

00:52:57.988 --> 00:52:59.031
Hang on.

00:53:04.328 --> 00:53:06.121
