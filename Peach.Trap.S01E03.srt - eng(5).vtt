00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.500
I apologize if it inconvenienced you.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.320
No!

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.450
It's nothing like that.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.930
I'm the one who should be sorry.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.010
I'll really treat you to a meal next time.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.600
Okay, you have to keep your promise.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.750
Okay, goodbye.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.900
He was looking out for me, but I...

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.070
Ugh.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.400
Messed up the interview?

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.520
You scared me. When did you get here?

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.980
You're the weird one,
sighing in front of the house gate, okay?

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.100
What now? Did the interview not go well?

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.670
No, it's not that.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.060
I feel bad for missing the interview
that Mr. Jeon arranged for me.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.480
Do you regret it?

00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:59.150
A little.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.050
So it's not a lot.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.800
I'm hungry.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.610
Have you eaten?

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:05.750
Not yet.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.070
Let's go eat.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.410
You must be exhausted.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.350
Here's your fried chicken.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:19.700
Thanks.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.950
It's been a long time since you came.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.300
I've been busy.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.970
-I want plain fried chicken.
-Welcome.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.000
Let's have the sweet and sour.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.020
But I want the plain one.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.570
Take a seat wherever you want.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:31.600
What about half-and-half?

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.850
Sure, sounds good.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:33.550
Sit.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.920
Oh? Mr. Jeon.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:44.950
This is my friend's shop.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.220
I just dropped by.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.480
Enjoy your meal.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:57.510
What are you waiting for? Sit.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:06.520
Mr. Jeon!

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.700
I'm sorry for letting you down.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.420
I didn't make myself clear previously.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.420
I know it's highly likely that

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.650
I'd pass the interview
you arranged for me.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:25.070
But...

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.650
this is the company
I've dreamed of working at

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.880
ever since I decided
to get into advertising.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.150
So even if I regret it later,

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.500
I thought I should
go for it at least once.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.080
I'm proud of you.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:45.800
Sorry?

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.200
You're way more mature

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.630
and more resilient
than I thought you are, Doha.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.120
Well, I'm not a kid...

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:57.980
You did the right thing.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.110
I guess I was worried for nothing.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.250
You're just fine on your own.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.100
Thank you.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.600
By the way, if you're here for dinner,

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.100
why don't you join us?

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.430
It seemed like
you haven't even had a bite.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:18.180
I don't think your friend would like that.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.320
No, he's very social. Hang on.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:27.070
No!

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.070
He's cool with it.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.750
If you're fine with it.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.900
You two must be really close.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.820
We've been friends our whole lives.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.700
Friends?

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:41.250
Let's go in.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.650
Maybe I shouldn't have invited him.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.350
Do you want some?

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.420
Here you are.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.270
You can't have...

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.620
fried chicken without beer.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.070
The beer is on the house. Enjoy.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.820
Let's drink.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.420
Cheers!

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.770
The girls' heads never dropped.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.620
Totally just staring at his face.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.320
That's right.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.000
So for the second round,
we have to go... there.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.850
Let's go.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.420
Yeon Haram, what are you waiting for?
Come on.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.700
No, I think I have something to do.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.200
Huh?

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.620
What do you mean you think?

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.890
I know what I have to do now.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.200
All of a sudden?

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.730
It's a long story. Go ahead.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.150
Well, he's popular.
That's not surprising. Let's go.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.200
Really?

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.730
-Let's follow him and join in the fun.
-No, no.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:32.570
Doha-hyung.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.400
Can I join you?

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.200
What?

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:40.670
I'll drink for you
so you don't get drunk, Doha-hyung.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.970
Won't you two join me in a drink?

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.850
Just going to leave me hanging?

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:53.980
It's embarrassing.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.150
When did you start wearing this watch?

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:45.610
