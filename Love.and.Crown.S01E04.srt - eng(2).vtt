LOVE & CROWN

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:31.025
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL MY QUEEN
BY XIE LOUNAN

00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:34.025
EPISODE 4

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:35.105
We have an invitation.

00:01:35.185 --> 00:01:36.905
Please, go upstairs
to the Green Haitang Chamber.

00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:38.585
This young lady is a distinguished guest.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:39.705
Let her in.

00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:43.385
Please come with me.

00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:46.305
Let's go.

00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:58.545
Master, why did you let her in?

00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:02.985
Willow and haitang blossoms.

00:02:03.505 --> 00:02:04.825
She's one of us.

00:02:22.905 --> 00:02:23.905
Look.

00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:36.305
Sorry for the long wait.

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:39.305
The highlight of our show today
will begin soon.

00:02:39.385 --> 00:02:42.745
You who come to this pleasure boat
must have already known the rules here.

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:43.665
A blind auction.

00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:46.145
You each have three
haitang flowers on your table,

00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:47.665
representing three bidding chances.

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:50.185
But let me put out a disclaimer now.

00:02:50.265 --> 00:02:52.465
If you bid but fail to pay,

00:02:53.265 --> 00:02:55.265
you'll be fed to the fish.

00:02:57.345 --> 00:02:59.825
-What are we bidding for today?
-I wonder.

00:02:59.905 --> 00:03:01.705
Allow me to start the bid.

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:03.665
My starting price is 100 liang.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:06.825
200 liang.

00:03:07.785 --> 00:03:09.505
How can we bid when we don't know
what it is?

00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:12.345
400 liang.

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:14.745
400 liang already? This soon?

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:17.625
Mr. Niu offers 400 liang.

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:19.305
Do I hear a higher bid?

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:26.745
3,000 liang.

00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:30.145
-3,000?
-3,000?

00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:34.505
Are you out of your mind?

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:36.225
How generous of this gentleman.

00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:37.465
3,000 liang.

00:03:37.545 --> 00:03:39.825
Any higher bids?

00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:40.985
5,000 liang.

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:43.665
5,000 liang?

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:44.865
5,000 liang?

00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:49.465
That's not fair.
He didn't throw the flower.

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:51.025
Patience, my esteemed guest.

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:53.225
Guests on the second floor,
in the Golden Haitang Chamber

00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:54.585
have special privileges,

00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:57.385
but they all have only three chances
as well.

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:02.065
6,000 liang.

00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:04.705
-8,000 liang.
-8,000 liang?

00:04:12.745 --> 00:04:14.225
Enough is enough. Stop it.

00:04:14.305 --> 00:04:15.425
What if they feed you to the fish?

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:16.865
Did you hear me?

00:04:25.705 --> 00:04:27.065
Two fluorite night pearls.

00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:33.105
Two fluorite night pearls.

00:04:33.185 --> 00:04:34.185
Fluorite night pearls.

00:04:39.505 --> 00:04:41.345
What an elucidating experience.

00:04:42.745 --> 00:04:44.425
That spoiled brat.

00:04:51.745 --> 00:04:53.985
What exquisite fluorite night pearls.
Fine tributes from the Western Sea.

00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:56.945
May I know where you hail from, Mr. Bai?

00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:58.465
This is just a transaction.

00:04:58.545 --> 00:05:00.785
Outside of this pleasure boat,
we're both strangers.

00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:03.545
Right. I agree.

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:07.425
I wonder what it is
that my husband spent a fortune

00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:08.385
to purchase.

00:05:08.465 --> 00:05:09.785
When can we get it?

00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:12.225
You're so impatient, Miss. Come with me.

00:05:13.265 --> 00:05:14.105
After you.

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:15.705
Wait for me here.

00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:17.425
I'd like to see a friend.

00:05:17.505 --> 00:05:19.225
A friend? Who?

00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:36.145
You're alone.

00:05:39.985 --> 00:05:41.345
Oh, my dear brother. Are you worried

00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:42.265
that I might feel lonely,

00:05:42.345 --> 00:05:44.465
so you came to have
a heart-to-heart talk with me?

00:05:44.545 --> 00:05:46.025
Someone tried to kill me when you learned

00:05:46.105 --> 00:05:47.985
that I joined Fenglai Pavilion.

00:05:48.065 --> 00:05:49.905
As my only brother,

00:05:49.985 --> 00:05:51.345
you sure want me dead.

00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:55.825
You think I tried to kill you?

00:05:58.665 --> 00:05:59.825
Are you implying

00:06:00.585 --> 00:06:02.105
that it was
your mother who wanted me dead,

00:06:02.705 --> 00:06:04.025
and you had no idea at all?

00:06:04.945 --> 00:06:06.665
Just like all the times before,

00:06:06.745 --> 00:06:08.585
it's always your mother who wants me dead,

00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:09.625
not you.

00:06:09.705 --> 00:06:11.225
Will you believe me if
I say I have nothing to do with it?

00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:14.345
Whether it's your or your mother's doing,

00:06:14.945 --> 00:06:16.345
it makes no difference.

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:25.465
Right.

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:30.585
You lured me to Botang Pleasure Boat.

00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:33.745
What if I kill you right now?

00:06:36.345 --> 00:06:37.625
Can you kill me though?

00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:39.145
I can try.

00:06:41.545 --> 00:06:42.985
I don't have time for a spar right now.

00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:46.585
Many kids on this boat are waiting
to be rescued.

00:06:47.265 --> 00:06:48.985
Drop your act.

00:06:49.065 --> 00:06:52.185
You forsook moral
principles for the throne.

00:06:52.265 --> 00:06:54.425
A human life is nothing in your eyes,

00:06:54.945 --> 00:06:56.465
let alone the lives of those kids.

00:06:56.545 --> 00:06:58.705
You only care about ruling Great Qi.

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:03.785
Yes.

00:07:03.865 --> 00:07:05.225
I do care about our empire

00:07:05.305 --> 00:07:07.345
but I care more about
the lives of my subjects.

00:07:07.425 --> 00:07:09.505
Even if it's just one person,

00:07:09.585 --> 00:07:10.985
that person is still
a citizen of Great Qi.

00:07:11.585 --> 00:07:14.425
You're still
the sanctimonious Xiao Huan I know.

00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:21.465
You again?

00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:26.345
Why do you two always
fight when you see each other?

00:07:27.225 --> 00:07:28.625
I told you to wait for me there.

00:07:29.865 --> 00:07:31.065
I…

00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:34.985
We have to pick the goods.

00:08:10.945 --> 00:08:12.945
They are here. Help yourself.

00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:16.665
Are these murder thralls?

00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:19.305
Keen eyes, Mister.

00:08:19.385 --> 00:08:20.705
They are stone men.

00:08:20.785 --> 00:08:22.985
They are invincible and feel no pain,

00:08:23.065 --> 00:08:24.305
perfect for a killing machine.

00:08:25.585 --> 00:08:27.425
It's hard to make one,

00:08:27.505 --> 00:08:29.465
and that's why it's expensive.

00:08:30.705 --> 00:08:32.425
We only have 10 minutes to save them.

00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:33.745
After 10 minutes,

00:08:33.825 --> 00:08:35.465
Prince of Yuzhang will surround the boat.

00:08:35.545 --> 00:08:38.505
None of the passengers
will be able to escape.

00:08:45.665 --> 00:08:47.705
We want this one.

00:08:47.785 --> 00:08:49.545
Wise choice.

00:08:56.825 --> 00:08:58.025
There are small boats behind the boat.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.145
Someone will pick you up there.

00:09:00.745 --> 00:09:02.225
Protect yourself and take the kids away.

00:09:20.465 --> 00:09:21.305
Run!

00:09:27.745 --> 00:09:29.305
-Here.
-Mother!

00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:30.225
Careful.

00:09:30.305 --> 00:09:31.505
Careful.

00:09:41.785 --> 00:09:42.625
Here.

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:47.425
Come.

00:09:47.505 --> 00:09:48.505
Take the kids away first.

00:09:48.585 --> 00:09:49.425
I'll save Bai.

00:09:57.985 --> 00:09:59.305
Why did you return?

00:09:59.385 --> 00:10:00.465
We fight together.

00:10:43.865 --> 00:10:44.985
Who are you?

00:10:45.065 --> 00:10:46.385
It doesn't matter.

00:10:46.465 --> 00:10:47.705
What you need to know

00:10:47.785 --> 00:10:50.145
is that he is not for you to kill.

00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:04.345
It's too late.

00:11:05.105 --> 00:11:06.425
Surrender yourself now.

00:11:19.665 --> 00:11:20.785
You came nonetheless.

00:11:20.865 --> 00:11:22.985
It is my feudal land.

00:11:23.065 --> 00:11:25.465
If someone wants to commit
an atrocious crime on my land,

00:11:25.545 --> 00:11:27.505
they'll have to get through me,
Prince of Yuzhang.

00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:33.105
Enemy vessels are
three zhang away from our boat.

00:11:33.185 --> 00:11:34.465
The boat must be destroyed.

00:11:36.345 --> 00:11:37.665
Long live Lingbi.

00:11:37.745 --> 00:11:38.825
We give our lives to you.

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:40.665
Long live Lingbi.

00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:42.105
We give our lives to you.

00:11:42.185 --> 00:11:43.305
Long live Lingbi.

00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:44.705
We give our lives to you.

00:11:44.785 --> 00:11:47.025
Long live Lingbi.
We give our lives to you.

00:11:47.105 --> 00:11:49.785
Long live Lingbi.
We give our lives to you.

00:11:49.865 --> 00:11:50.825
Long live Lingbi.

00:11:50.905 --> 00:11:51.865
-We give our lives to you.
-Run!

00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:54.665
Long live Lingbi.
We give our lives to you.

00:11:54.745 --> 00:11:57.265
Long live Lingbi.
We give our lives to you.

00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:39.305
FENGLAI PAVILION

00:12:39.385 --> 00:12:41.985
Miss Ling,
you merely suffered from the shock,

00:12:42.065 --> 00:12:43.305
so you're fine.

00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:45.145
He, however,
got the short end of the stick.

00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:48.025
His back is seriously wounded,
and he is suffering from nightmares.

00:12:48.785 --> 00:12:50.665
We don't know when he'll wake up.

00:12:55.825 --> 00:12:57.945
Bai. I'm sorry.

00:12:58.705 --> 00:13:00.025
Please be all right.

00:13:00.825 --> 00:13:01.905
What a joke.

00:13:01.985 --> 00:13:02.945
What a joke.

00:13:03.025 --> 00:13:04.985
You want to regain your power?

00:13:05.065 --> 00:13:06.465
Have you forgotten

00:13:06.545 --> 00:13:09.025
that you gave it to
us willingly in the past?

00:13:13.665 --> 00:13:14.945
Your Highness.

00:13:19.305 --> 00:13:20.705
It is cold out here,

00:13:20.785 --> 00:13:22.825
and you have a weak constitution.

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:25.665
Why are you standing here alone?

00:13:31.865 --> 00:13:34.065
Don't do this, Your Highness.

00:13:34.145 --> 00:13:34.985
Come.

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:40.625
If one day,

00:13:40.705 --> 00:13:42.305
I become the emperor,

00:13:42.385 --> 00:13:44.065
I shall make you the Grand Chancellor,

00:13:44.145 --> 00:13:45.825
and Cangcang the empress.

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:49.625
The Empress Dowager
never takes His Highness seriously.

00:13:49.705 --> 00:13:51.625
His Highness is isolated politically.

00:13:51.705 --> 00:13:54.345
It is shrewd of him to form
an alliance with the Grand Tutor.

00:13:55.145 --> 00:13:57.385
But should he become
the emperor in the future,

00:13:57.465 --> 00:14:00.265
this promise might be
the one thing that binds him.

00:14:00.345 --> 00:14:01.185
Indeed.

00:14:04.625 --> 00:14:05.905
Grand Tutor Ling,

00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:07.345
when will you let me rule in my own right?

00:14:08.025 --> 00:14:09.345
The day Cangcang weds you

00:14:09.425 --> 00:14:11.665
will be the day you take real power.

00:14:11.745 --> 00:14:14.745
Unfortunately,
you might not live to see that day.

00:14:14.825 --> 00:14:15.945
Isn't it great to be the Bai Chifan

00:14:16.025 --> 00:14:18.225
who roams freely in the martial world?

00:14:18.865 --> 00:14:20.225
If I lose my power,

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.145
I'll lose my life too.

00:14:24.745 --> 00:14:25.905
I will treat Cangcang with sincerity.

00:14:27.025 --> 00:14:29.185
Your sincerity is a joke.

00:14:29.265 --> 00:14:31.705
What a lovestruck ruler!

00:14:31.785 --> 00:14:33.065
Not only did
you fail to regain your power,

00:14:33.145 --> 00:14:35.105
but you will live like you used to before,

00:14:35.185 --> 00:14:36.705
wondering every day

00:14:36.785 --> 00:14:39.385
if you can live to
see the sunrise tomorrow.

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:42.145
You lay low for ten years,

00:14:42.225 --> 00:14:43.585
but you messed up
your plan in one crucial moment.

00:14:44.185 --> 00:14:47.665
You brought this upon yourself.

00:14:49.345 --> 00:14:50.185
No.

00:14:50.825 --> 00:14:54.385
No. What should I do? This can't be it.

00:14:54.465 --> 00:14:55.465
Bai.

00:14:59.985 --> 00:15:01.665
Bai. You're finally awake.

00:15:07.385 --> 00:15:08.625
Cangcang.

00:15:08.705 --> 00:15:09.745
Marry me.

00:15:11.825 --> 00:15:12.825
What?

00:15:12.905 --> 00:15:15.145
Cangcang. I love you.

00:15:15.745 --> 00:15:17.585
Marry me. All right?

00:15:36.465 --> 00:15:37.385
Luo.

00:15:39.865 --> 00:15:40.905
Cangcang.

00:15:40.985 --> 00:15:42.905
Father wants me
to bring you back to the Capital.

00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:44.105
Come with me.

00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:47.985
Let Cangcang go already.

00:15:48.065 --> 00:15:49.985
I'm going to marry Cangcang.

00:16:04.185 --> 00:16:05.665
Luo, don't hurt Bai.

00:16:05.745 --> 00:16:07.105
Cangcang.

00:16:07.185 --> 00:16:08.945
Since the beginning,
he approached you to fulfill his plan.

00:16:09.025 --> 00:16:10.265
He has an agenda.

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:11.545
I know very well if
he has an agenda or not.

00:16:11.625 --> 00:16:12.825
Someone with a secret agenda

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.105
will not risk their lives to
save me again and again.

00:16:14.705 --> 00:16:15.665
Cangcang.

00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:17.345
He did that to earn your sympathy.

00:16:17.425 --> 00:16:18.585
Can't you tell?

00:16:18.665 --> 00:16:19.785
Luo.

00:16:19.865 --> 00:16:21.785
I can tell if it's a ruse
to earn my sympathy,

00:16:21.865 --> 00:16:22.785
or if he truly cares about me.

00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:26.345
You'd rather believe
a stranger you just met than me?

00:16:26.425 --> 00:16:27.465
I…

00:16:30.785 --> 00:16:31.825
I didn't mean it that way.

00:16:32.545 --> 00:16:33.585
Do you…

00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:36.185
Do you fancy him as well?

00:16:46.825 --> 00:16:48.985
Father wants me to bring you back.

00:16:49.065 --> 00:16:50.185
Don't make my job difficult for me.

00:16:55.865 --> 00:16:56.985
Luo.

00:16:57.065 --> 00:16:58.865
Headstrong as I may be,
I dare not defy my father.

00:17:00.425 --> 00:17:01.945
Give me three days.

00:17:02.025 --> 00:17:02.905
Once I settle everything,

00:17:02.985 --> 00:17:04.505
I'll see my father
and ask for a punishment.

00:17:04.585 --> 00:17:05.704
But today,

00:17:06.505 --> 00:17:07.345
you're not hurting Bai.

00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:27.905
FENGLAI PAVILION

00:17:30.505 --> 00:17:31.385
I'm coming.

00:17:33.425 --> 00:17:34.265
Bai?

00:17:36.785 --> 00:17:37.625
What is this?

00:17:39.065 --> 00:17:40.825
-A gift.
-A gift?

00:17:44.185 --> 00:17:45.025
Frostflame Iron?

00:17:45.945 --> 00:17:47.585
Give this to your master.

00:17:48.825 --> 00:17:49.665
Cangcang,

00:17:50.305 --> 00:17:51.225
if I want your hand in marriage,

00:17:51.305 --> 00:17:53.225
I'll have to earn
your father's and master's recognition.

00:17:53.825 --> 00:17:56.705
I don't want to see any tension
between you and them because of me.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.385
So let's pay your master a visit.

00:18:03.865 --> 00:18:05.225
I'm sure he'll be over the moon.

00:18:05.305 --> 00:18:07.345
Among all things, he loves
making swords the most.

00:18:09.545 --> 00:18:12.505
Doesn't this belong to Prince of Yuzhang?
Why do you have it?

00:18:16.425 --> 00:18:19.705
HEROIC COMPOSURE

00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:21.305
Frostflame Iron?

00:18:22.705 --> 00:18:24.465
It's mine.

00:18:24.545 --> 00:18:25.785
Why must I give it to you?

00:18:27.545 --> 00:18:29.065
Botang Pleasure Boat was destroyed.

00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:31.185
The Lingbi Sect
suffers another great loss.

00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:34.505
You also solved
the case of the missing boys.

00:18:34.585 --> 00:18:36.785
I'm sure the imperial court
will reward you handsomely.

00:18:37.305 --> 00:18:38.585
You don't need the Frostflame Iron.

00:18:41.025 --> 00:18:43.425
I can give it to you for free.

00:18:44.025 --> 00:18:45.065
But only if you…

00:18:46.665 --> 00:18:47.865
If I?

00:18:49.665 --> 00:18:52.945
I'm afraid you can't give me what I want.

00:19:00.345 --> 00:19:02.585
Don't covet what isn't yours.

00:19:07.065 --> 00:19:08.065
Give me the Frostflame Iron.

00:19:09.385 --> 00:19:11.785
Are you ordering me as the emperor

00:19:12.425 --> 00:19:14.385
or are you pleading as my brother?

00:19:16.425 --> 00:19:17.305
What do you think?

00:19:30.385 --> 00:19:31.225
Whatever.

00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:33.745
I saved you twice in the quarry

00:19:34.545 --> 00:19:35.665
and on the boat.

00:19:37.225 --> 00:19:38.785
I will ask you to pay me back

00:19:39.705 --> 00:19:41.465
for those favors eventually.

00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:48.425
Consider this iron ore

00:19:48.945 --> 00:19:51.905
my gift to you for your upcoming wedding.

00:19:55.545 --> 00:19:56.385
Thank you.

00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:05.865
Bai, wait for me.

00:20:11.545 --> 00:20:12.385
Cangcang.

00:20:13.065 --> 00:20:14.545
Didn't you say your master is a swordsman?

00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:17.145
I thought a swordsman would
go on an adventure to uphold justice.

00:20:17.225 --> 00:20:18.265
Why is your master

00:20:18.345 --> 00:20:20.305
residing in this remote area?

00:20:21.545 --> 00:20:24.065
He was a swordsman,
and now, he's a recluse.

00:20:24.145 --> 00:20:26.625
Because
he doesn't like the hustle and bustle.

00:20:28.385 --> 00:20:29.465
How did you meet your master then?

00:20:31.145 --> 00:20:34.825
Did I tell you
why I wanted to rescue those kids?

00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:38.825
When I was little…

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:40.185
Father!

00:20:40.745 --> 00:20:43.905
I miss Mother. Can we visit her grave?

00:20:43.985 --> 00:20:45.105
Cangcang.

00:20:45.185 --> 00:20:46.625
I'm busy.

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:48.745
Quit making a fuss. Go back now.

00:20:48.825 --> 00:20:52.105
No. I don't want to stay home alone.

00:20:52.825 --> 00:20:53.945
Cangcang.

00:20:54.705 --> 00:20:55.745
Be a good girl.

00:20:56.345 --> 00:20:59.505
We will visit her grave in the future.

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.905
Bring her back.

00:21:02.985 --> 00:21:04.505
Find some playmates for her.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:06.225
Go back now.

00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:14.265
Slow down, Young Lady!

00:21:14.345 --> 00:21:15.665
Don't trip yourself.

00:21:21.825 --> 00:21:22.745
If you won't bring me there,

00:21:22.825 --> 00:21:24.705
I'll go there myself.

00:21:38.545 --> 00:21:40.865
Try running now. Run!

00:21:41.465 --> 00:21:43.105
I'll spank you.

00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:45.025
Father will save me!

00:21:45.585 --> 00:21:46.865
Run! Try running.

00:21:47.625 --> 00:21:48.985
-He'll save me.
-Come out!

00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:51.825
My father is the best father in the world!

00:21:55.265 --> 00:21:57.985
You had similar experiences,

00:21:58.065 --> 00:22:00.425
so you hate those who traffic children.

00:22:06.705 --> 00:22:08.305
What does this have
to do with your master?

00:22:11.225 --> 00:22:13.665
Mercy, sir.
I've not seen this girl before.

00:22:13.745 --> 00:22:16.025
I'm serious, sir.

00:22:16.105 --> 00:22:17.985
Just take that girl away.

00:22:18.065 --> 00:22:19.425
For free.

00:22:25.425 --> 00:22:27.305
Don't be scared. Let me help you.

00:22:32.025 --> 00:22:33.785
Easy now. I'll take you home, all right?

00:22:36.145 --> 00:22:37.385
I'm not a bad guy.

00:22:38.585 --> 00:22:40.105
Tell me.

00:22:40.185 --> 00:22:41.345
What is your name?

00:22:42.705 --> 00:22:44.745
-And then?
-And then,

00:22:45.625 --> 00:22:47.545
Master brought me to my father.

00:22:47.625 --> 00:22:50.545
My father hugged me and cried.

00:22:50.625 --> 00:22:51.465
Master also told Father

00:22:51.545 --> 00:22:53.985
that his daughter
had suffered the same fate,

00:22:54.065 --> 00:22:56.305
and that he had been looking for her.

00:22:56.385 --> 00:22:57.625
Did he manage to find her?

00:23:01.465 --> 00:23:02.585
It's over there.

00:23:03.785 --> 00:23:06.425
Master told me
that she loved haitang blossoms the most.

00:23:06.505 --> 00:23:08.105
Even though I have never met her,

00:23:08.185 --> 00:23:09.025
I'm sure

00:23:09.625 --> 00:23:11.545
she missed her father

00:23:11.625 --> 00:23:13.025
and this wonderful world a lot.

00:23:13.105 --> 00:23:14.825
TOMBSTONE OF BELOVED DAUGHTER,
LI XIAOTANG

00:23:17.505 --> 00:23:18.865
So later,

00:23:20.305 --> 00:23:21.865
I made the decision

00:23:22.745 --> 00:23:24.265
that even though
Master had lost her daughter,

00:23:25.145 --> 00:23:27.865
I would treat him as if he were my father.

00:23:31.665 --> 00:23:32.505
Bai.

00:23:33.465 --> 00:23:35.545
You will treat Master with kindness,
won't you?

00:23:42.265 --> 00:23:43.985
TOMBSTONE OF BELOVED DAUGHTER,
LI XIAOTANG

00:23:44.065 --> 00:23:45.345
Master, I'm here.

00:23:46.225 --> 00:23:47.305
Master.

00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:48.585
I'm here to visit you.

00:23:53.385 --> 00:23:54.665
Master.

00:23:56.785 --> 00:23:57.945
I'm here to visit you.

00:23:59.465 --> 00:24:00.585
Where did he go?

00:24:06.985 --> 00:24:08.225
What are you doing here?

00:24:08.305 --> 00:24:09.785
I'm here to see Cangcang's master.

00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:11.145
You're not welcome here.

00:24:12.145 --> 00:24:14.025
Are you saying that as Cangcang's master,

00:24:14.825 --> 00:24:16.305
or as the Ghost King?

00:24:20.105 --> 00:24:22.265
As expected of
a student of Grand Tutor Ling.

00:24:22.945 --> 00:24:25.865
Do you know
what your teacher thinks of you?

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:28.825
He said you were like a wolf pup

00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:31.145
prowling in the snow.

00:24:31.225 --> 00:24:34.145
People assume you're alone and powerless.

00:24:34.225 --> 00:24:35.945
But they seem to forget

00:24:38.745 --> 00:24:41.825
that you are still a wolf.

00:24:50.225 --> 00:24:51.065
Master!

00:24:51.785 --> 00:24:53.145
You're here.

00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:54.305
I was looking for you.

00:24:55.425 --> 00:24:56.425
Greetings, sir.

00:24:58.585 --> 00:25:00.065
I see you have talked to him.

00:25:00.145 --> 00:25:01.905
-Allow me to introduce…
-No need.

00:25:01.985 --> 00:25:03.425
We met just now.

00:25:05.025 --> 00:25:08.665
Then, about our marriage…

00:25:10.905 --> 00:25:13.105
I am just a farmer now.

00:25:13.185 --> 00:25:15.465
Your father should have the final say.

00:25:15.545 --> 00:25:16.585
What do you mean?

00:25:16.665 --> 00:25:18.585
You're as important to me as my father.

00:25:19.465 --> 00:25:20.745
I trust your judgment.

00:25:20.825 --> 00:25:21.865
Cangcang,

00:25:21.945 --> 00:25:24.745
Bai Chifan told me
that you came to have a sword made.

00:25:24.825 --> 00:25:27.185
Quick. Give me the Frostflame Iron.

00:26:15.465 --> 00:26:16.665
Your Majesty,

00:26:16.745 --> 00:26:18.265
I found something
important whilst investigating

00:26:18.345 --> 00:26:19.785
Grand Tutor Ling.

00:26:19.865 --> 00:26:21.225
Ling Cangcang's master is likely

00:26:21.305 --> 00:26:22.865
to be the Ghost King.

00:26:24.025 --> 00:26:24.905
Likely, you said?

00:26:24.985 --> 00:26:28.425
Don't you know how important he is
to Cangcang?

00:26:28.505 --> 00:26:29.865
I can capture Li Lu

00:26:29.945 --> 00:26:31.705
and interrogate him before we decide.

00:26:31.785 --> 00:26:33.105
No need for that.

00:26:33.185 --> 00:26:35.625
If I want Cangcang to marry me,
I must pay him a visit.

00:26:36.585 --> 00:26:38.025
If he turns out to be the Ghost King,

00:26:38.545 --> 00:26:40.945
we can only act on a full moon's night.

00:26:51.265 --> 00:26:52.305
Bai.

00:26:53.225 --> 00:26:54.785
What are you doing out here?

00:26:54.865 --> 00:26:55.825
I'm here to get some fresh air.

00:26:57.105 --> 00:26:58.665
Did you know?

00:26:58.745 --> 00:27:00.825
Master never lets
anyone into his sword cottage.

00:27:00.905 --> 00:27:03.945
But he lets you in.
That means you've earned his recognition.

00:27:09.425 --> 00:27:10.585
What's wrong?

00:27:13.905 --> 00:27:15.625
The full moon's night is near.

00:27:18.665 --> 00:27:19.505
Indeed.

00:27:20.025 --> 00:27:23.225
It feels like the moon here
is prettier than anywhere else.

00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:26.985
In the past,

00:27:27.065 --> 00:27:28.705
Master would never
allow me to admire the moon

00:27:28.785 --> 00:27:29.905
on a full moon's night.

00:27:30.905 --> 00:27:32.385
But tomorrow is a full moon's night

00:27:33.145 --> 00:27:34.705
and the day we'll get our swords.

00:27:35.425 --> 00:27:38.025
I hope he won't chase me away this time.

00:27:47.465 --> 00:27:48.545
Cangcang.

00:27:49.865 --> 00:27:51.625
I pray that you won't resent me.

00:28:37.065 --> 00:28:37.905
Is it done?

00:28:38.745 --> 00:28:39.585
Yes.

00:28:41.225 --> 00:28:42.545
Cangcang. Take a look.

00:28:55.345 --> 00:28:56.225
What an amazing blade.

00:29:12.305 --> 00:29:13.265
Master,

00:29:14.145 --> 00:29:15.025
it is a good sword.

00:29:15.665 --> 00:29:18.785
If that is your choice,
you should now name it.

00:29:26.945 --> 00:29:29.345
Master, I have already thought it through.

00:29:29.945 --> 00:29:31.785
Can we call it Willow?

00:29:43.065 --> 00:29:44.185
Of course.

00:29:45.425 --> 00:29:46.545
Thanks, Master.

00:29:56.745 --> 00:29:57.585
Bai Chifan,

00:29:57.665 --> 00:29:59.065
you can have this sword.

00:30:00.945 --> 00:30:02.945
Master, you should give it a name.

00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:08.585
The dragon hasn't soared high,

00:30:09.185 --> 00:30:10.785
but his reign can already be felt.

00:30:12.825 --> 00:30:15.265
This blade shall be called Rex.

00:30:17.305 --> 00:30:20.105
Rex and Willow.

00:30:20.945 --> 00:30:22.185
Those are good names.

00:30:26.945 --> 00:30:30.505
Consider these two blades

00:30:31.185 --> 00:30:32.345
my gifts to your wedding.

00:30:56.305 --> 00:30:58.025
Bai, thank my master already.

00:30:59.865 --> 00:31:00.905
Thank you for the sword, sir.

00:31:07.945 --> 00:31:09.105
Thank you, Master.

00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:38.065
You're here.

00:31:39.665 --> 00:31:41.465
Is Cangcang asleep already?

00:31:42.265 --> 00:31:45.625
Without her chattering, it feels quiet.

00:31:46.265 --> 00:31:48.425
You shouldn't have stayed here tonight.

00:31:48.505 --> 00:31:50.225
I'm sure your men

00:31:50.305 --> 00:31:52.105
are all around this sword grave.

00:31:52.625 --> 00:31:55.105
You have already noticed my plan,

00:31:55.185 --> 00:31:57.145
yet you decided to stay.

00:31:57.225 --> 00:31:58.545
Are you surrendering yourself?

00:31:59.985 --> 00:32:01.985
Do you know why

00:32:02.065 --> 00:32:05.065
Cangcang named the blade Willow?

00:32:06.425 --> 00:32:07.385
My daughter

00:32:07.465 --> 00:32:09.825
was playing house with
the kids from the same village.

00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:11.585
She loved to pretend to be a heroine.

00:32:11.665 --> 00:32:12.985
She went out to play all the time,

00:32:13.985 --> 00:32:17.145
and pestered me
to make her a wooden sword.

00:32:18.065 --> 00:32:20.865
Your sword is the best
sword in the world, Father.

00:32:20.945 --> 00:32:21.905
Thank you, Father.

00:32:21.985 --> 00:32:24.305
Should we give the sword a name?

00:32:24.385 --> 00:32:25.465
Sure!

00:32:27.305 --> 00:32:30.225
That day when I found my daughter,
I saw a mountain full of cadavers.

00:32:31.025 --> 00:32:32.785
All I could find of her

00:32:33.585 --> 00:32:35.465
was a mangled hand.

00:32:35.545 --> 00:32:36.865
That hand

00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:40.585
was clinging to the wooden sword tightly

00:32:42.545 --> 00:32:43.745
but she…

00:32:45.545 --> 00:32:46.745
She was gone.

00:32:47.985 --> 00:32:50.305
I held her hands

00:32:52.425 --> 00:32:56.905
and carved the name, Willow, on it

00:32:58.185 --> 00:33:01.425
by guiding her step by step.

00:33:03.025 --> 00:33:04.585
Breeze passes
through the willow tree softly.

00:33:04.665 --> 00:33:05.985
The moon shines on the haitang blossoms.

00:33:06.065 --> 00:33:07.985
So you know

00:33:09.065 --> 00:33:10.185
the complete codes.

00:33:10.865 --> 00:33:12.265
On Botang Pleasure Boat,

00:33:12.865 --> 00:33:13.785
when Jin Haitang

00:33:13.865 --> 00:33:15.265
saw the haitang blossom
pendant on Cangcang's waist,

00:33:16.025 --> 00:33:17.745
she let us into the auction.

00:33:17.825 --> 00:33:21.105
I suppose the pendant
was left behind by your daughter.

00:33:28.145 --> 00:33:30.305
You are indeed using Cangcang.

00:33:31.145 --> 00:33:31.985
She's such a sweet girl.

00:33:32.065 --> 00:33:33.825
How could you…

00:33:35.145 --> 00:33:38.425
So the Ghost King has empathy?

00:33:39.145 --> 00:33:41.305
Why did you lead the Lingbi Sect

00:33:41.385 --> 00:33:43.065
and commit inhumane crimes then?

00:33:43.145 --> 00:33:45.745
Factors out of our control often bind us.

00:33:45.825 --> 00:33:47.865
The Ghost King is but a puppet.

00:33:47.945 --> 00:33:50.185
I don't think myself morally perfect.

00:33:51.105 --> 00:33:53.825
I seek vengeance and repay gratitude.

00:33:56.505 --> 00:33:58.305
But why give your life away now?

00:33:58.985 --> 00:34:00.225
Come to the palace with me and repent.

00:34:00.945 --> 00:34:02.385
You will bring solace to everyone.

00:34:12.304 --> 00:34:13.585
Heed my warning.

00:34:14.145 --> 00:34:15.824
Stop pestering the Lingbi Sect.

00:34:16.344 --> 00:34:18.105
If I don't die, there will be no peace.

00:34:19.625 --> 00:34:21.225
So make it quick.

00:34:22.225 --> 00:34:23.545
Alas, what a cruel joke from life.

00:34:23.625 --> 00:34:25.425
Keep the truth from Cangcang.

00:34:28.025 --> 00:34:29.505
A promise from the emperor

00:34:31.945 --> 00:34:33.905
shall never be broken.

00:34:43.824 --> 00:34:44.905
Do it.

00:35:02.145 --> 00:35:03.265
Master!

00:35:10.905 --> 00:35:11.945
Master!

00:35:15.425 --> 00:35:16.585
Master!

00:35:25.425 --> 00:35:27.225
Master!

00:35:28.985 --> 00:35:30.025
Master!

00:35:30.665 --> 00:35:32.785
Wake up, Master!

00:36:11.665 --> 00:36:13.225
Tell me why.

00:36:19.585 --> 00:36:22.105
Why?

00:36:37.545 --> 00:36:39.985
My intervention was tardy.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:36:59.185 --> 00:37:00.705
What did he just call you?

00:37:16.785 --> 00:37:18.065
You killed my master.

00:37:18.145 --> 00:37:19.465
Why would I marry you?

00:37:20.985 --> 00:37:22.705
I want you to marry me willingly.

00:37:22.785 --> 00:37:27.185
I, Ling Cangcang, am willing to marry you.

00:37:29.105 --> 00:37:30.305
Who are you?

00:37:30.385 --> 00:37:33.745
Ling Cangcang or the Empress of Great Qi?

00:37:33.825 --> 00:37:35.665
Do you love the Emperor of Great Qi?

00:37:36.185 --> 00:37:38.825
Bai Chifan never existed.

00:37:39.425 --> 00:37:40.465
Bai Chifan…

00:37:47.425 --> 00:37:50.905
Bai Chifan never existed.

00:37:55.985 --> 00:37:57.985
My dear. You're awake.

00:38:01.505 --> 00:38:02.625
Your Majesty.

00:38:07.305 --> 00:38:08.345
How come you're here, Your Majesty?

00:38:10.945 --> 00:38:14.225
I came in
and heard you talking in your dream.

00:38:15.425 --> 00:38:16.465
Are you all right?

00:38:17.705 --> 00:38:18.985
I…

00:38:21.105 --> 00:38:22.145
I had a dream.

00:38:24.425 --> 00:38:25.465
What is it about?

00:38:26.425 --> 00:38:27.665
I dreamed that…

00:38:35.745 --> 00:38:36.865
I dreamed that…

00:38:38.545 --> 00:38:40.345
I dreamed that you were kind,

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:44.265
and that my master was still alive.

00:38:44.905 --> 00:38:48.585
And I was still the carefree soul.

00:38:51.345 --> 00:38:53.665
-My dear…
-Alas, a dream is the opposite of reality.

00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:58.305
My master is dead.

00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:11.505
Your Majesty, it's time to wake up.

00:39:11.585 --> 00:39:13.625
Today is the day you return home.

00:39:15.505 --> 00:39:16.545
Come in.

00:39:23.025 --> 00:39:23.865
Your Majesty.

00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:28.945
Since you have to return home today,

00:39:29.825 --> 00:39:31.065
I understand it might be tiring.

00:39:31.585 --> 00:39:33.905
So I will go back to
the Grand Chancellor's Manor with you.

00:39:34.945 --> 00:39:35.985
What do you think?

00:39:37.105 --> 00:39:38.705
You are a busy man, Your Majesty.

00:39:38.785 --> 00:39:41.305
I shouldn't burden you
with such a trivial matter.

00:39:44.705 --> 00:39:48.425
Your matter is not a trivial matter to me.

00:39:53.385 --> 00:39:54.705
I wouldn't want to impose.

00:40:18.105 --> 00:40:19.305
Relax, my dear.

00:40:20.185 --> 00:40:21.745
This is a wedding gift
from the young general,

00:40:22.345 --> 00:40:23.745
Ling Jueding.

00:40:24.345 --> 00:40:28.825
It took me a while to locate it.

00:40:29.545 --> 00:40:32.145
My dear, you may take a look.

00:40:42.865 --> 00:40:44.305
How thoughtful of General Ling.

00:40:45.265 --> 00:40:47.545
He couldn't attend
our wedding in the Capital,

00:40:47.625 --> 00:40:49.945
yet he gave us such a meaningful gift.

00:40:52.225 --> 00:40:54.425
He is stationed in Jiangzhou.

00:40:55.225 --> 00:40:57.105
I can only imagine the pain
he feels from being away from his family.

00:40:58.265 --> 00:41:00.705
Maybe it'll be less miserable

00:41:01.305 --> 00:41:03.625
if he
can secure a position in the Capital.

00:41:09.705 --> 00:41:11.065
My dear.

00:41:11.145 --> 00:41:13.305
You must think about
the ones who are still alive.

00:41:21.185 --> 00:41:22.665
Jueding is brave, strong,

00:41:23.185 --> 00:41:24.745
and straightforward.

00:41:24.825 --> 00:41:26.545
He should be a soldier.

00:41:26.625 --> 00:41:27.625
If…

00:41:32.665 --> 00:41:34.865
If we find him a desk job in the Capital,

00:41:35.585 --> 00:41:37.025
I'm sure he'd hate

00:41:38.345 --> 00:41:39.665
that kind of lifestyle.

00:41:42.585 --> 00:41:43.665
You're right, my dear.

00:41:44.625 --> 00:41:45.905
I didn't think of that.

00:41:45.985 --> 00:41:47.385
In that case…

00:41:47.465 --> 00:41:48.465
I turned your offer down,

00:41:48.545 --> 00:41:50.585
thinking that you'd be
too busy to come with me.

00:41:51.945 --> 00:41:52.985
But if

00:41:54.905 --> 00:41:57.465
you are willing to come home with me,

00:41:59.105 --> 00:42:00.745
I'll be extremely delighted.

00:42:02.665 --> 00:42:03.505
Good.

00:42:04.385 --> 00:42:07.025
Then I shall wait for you outside.

00:43:25.385 --> 00:43:27.945
Do you think
His Majesty loves Her Majesty?

00:43:28.585 --> 00:43:29.585
What are you on about?

00:43:30.105 --> 00:43:30.985
After they got married,

00:43:31.065 --> 00:43:33.225
His Majesty hasn't
consummated with Her Majesty.

00:43:33.305 --> 00:43:34.465
Everyone in the palace

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:36.465
is saying that His Majesty
only married Her Majesty

00:43:37.065 --> 00:43:38.345
for political reasons.

00:43:39.465 --> 00:43:40.945
But seeing

00:43:41.025 --> 00:43:43.265
His Majesty go back
home with Her Majesty today,

00:43:43.785 --> 00:43:46.385
I feel that he does love her.

00:44:22.185 --> 00:44:24.265
LING MANOR

00:44:26.825 --> 00:44:27.945
Let's go.
