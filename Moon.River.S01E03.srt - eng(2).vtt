He...

00:10:43.588 --> 00:10:45.321
As for Dal I,

00:10:45.321 --> 00:10:48.088
don't tell her that I'm the Crown Prince.

00:10:48.088 --> 00:10:49.588
If she learns my identity,

00:10:49.588 --> 00:10:53.053
she'll fret over past disrespects

00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:55.288
and fall ill.

00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:59.688
He might think we're runaway servants too,
so he told us to go somewhere safe and wait.

00:10:59.688 --> 00:11:02.554
He promised to bring you back safely.

Strange. I was certain that
porter's father was a palace eunuch.

The intuition felt spot-on.

This seems like the 38th time I'm answering this.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:46.488
Enough.

Yes, I spoke loudly for you to hear.

Alright.

00:12:12.588 --> 00:12:15.021
I'm afraid I might go to her.

You'd really let me go so easily?

00:27:00.488 --> 00:27:02.461
Well, I

00:27:02.461 --> 00:27:04.854
no longer need you.

00:27:05.854 --> 00:27:08.293
Your presence here

00:27:08.989 --> 00:27:11.054
only complicates things.

00:27:11.688 --> 00:27:13.421
Is this truth?

00:27:13.421 --> 00:27:15.521
You won't change your mind later, will you?

00:27:15.521 --> 00:27:17.341
Instead,

00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:18.854
grant me one request.

00:27:18.854 --> 00:27:20.688
You see, a request

00:27:20.688 --> 00:27:24.121
that goes too far becomes coercion
and even a threat.

00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:26.188
It also depends on what kind of request it is...

00:27:26.188 --> 00:27:28.354
I haven't torn up the contract yet.

00:27:28.354 --> 00:27:31.121
I mean, there are different
degrees of effort required.

00:27:31.121 --> 00:27:32.721
I need to give it my all.

00:27:32.721 --> 00:27:34.521
What could it be?

00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:39.221
Greetings to you.

00:27:39.221 --> 00:27:40.254
Who are you?

00:27:40.254 --> 00:27:42.088
Ah, a newcomer I see.

00:27:42.088 --> 00:27:44.253
[Yuk Uijeon: Six state-licensed monopoly markets]
I'm a courier for Hanyang Merchant Group

00:27:44.253 --> 00:27:46.521
serving former Master Leader.

00:27:46.521 --> 00:27:49.788
I've heard a courier has been granted
access to the Royal Wardrobe by His Highness.

00:27:49.788 --> 00:27:53.421
Could you be Cha Eun Woo?

00:27:54.221 --> 00:27:56.121
I am.

00:27:58.354 --> 00:28:00.388
I am Cha Eun Woo.

00:28:02.688 --> 00:28:03.688
Enter then.

00:28:03.688 --> 00:28:05.521
My thanks.

00:28:07.721 --> 00:28:11.288
Alright, let's go in.

00:28:11.288 --> 00:28:13.121
Yes.

00:28:15.221 --> 00:28:18.321
This bracelet has a crimson gem on it,
considered the finest of the hong jewels.

00:28:18.321 --> 00:28:20.421
Wearing it brings health and wisdom

00:28:20.421 --> 00:28:22.921
and banishes the fears in one's heart.

00:28:22.921 --> 00:28:25.521
Moreover, it holds the profound meaning

00:28:25.521 --> 00:28:27.054
of overcoming all dangers and obstacles.

00:28:27.054 --> 00:28:30.021
Ah, enough. Enough.

00:28:30.021 --> 00:28:33.288
Never mind the meaning.
Prepare something valuable that costs a lot.

00:28:33.288 --> 00:28:34.988
Understood, Your Highness.

00:28:34.988 --> 00:28:36.788
By when should we prepare it?

00:28:36.788 --> 00:28:38.321
[One shijin: Two hours]
Prepare it within one shijin.

00:28:38.321 --> 00:28:39.488
We depart today.

00:28:39.488 --> 00:28:42.721
What? Right now?

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:45.021
But there's so much to prepare.

00:28:45.021 --> 00:28:48.654
I'll take only fifteen royal guards
for a brief trip.

00:28:48.654 --> 00:28:51.521
- Prepare it.
- Yes, Your Highness.

00:28:54.721 --> 00:28:56.554
Bokbunja berries.

00:29:06.188 --> 00:29:08.054
The guards are exhausted.

00:29:08.054 --> 00:29:10.254
Let them rest awhile.

00:29:11.854 --> 00:29:14.154
Very well, we shall.

00:29:14.154 --> 00:29:16.621
Find a suitable resting place nearby.

00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:18.621
Yes, Your Highness.

00:29:38.854 --> 00:29:41.021
Going to Sinjusa Temple?

00:29:41.021 --> 00:29:43.421
Why?

00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:45.788
Today's errand is secret.

00:29:45.788 --> 00:29:47.554
Tell no one.

00:29:47.554 --> 00:29:48.554
Why not?

00:29:48.554 --> 00:29:52.388
Is it some love letter to your sweetheart?

00:29:57.388 --> 00:29:59.321
Understood.

00:30:02.688 --> 00:30:04.288
It's a secret.

00:30:04.288 --> 00:30:08.021
Where are you going then, my lord?

00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:09.988
It's a secret too.

00:30:11.854 --> 00:30:13.621
If you keep following me

00:30:13.621 --> 00:30:16.088
just because I look like her,

00:30:16.088 --> 00:30:20.088
how would your late wife feel?

00:30:21.854 --> 00:30:24.721
Well, you know,

00:30:24.721 --> 00:30:26.588
well...

00:30:26.588 --> 00:30:28.888
that time...

00:30:29.854 --> 00:30:31.754
during Jangmunhyeong punishment...

00:30:32.754 --> 00:30:35.688
Would you like to accompany us
to the Sinjusa Temple as well?

00:30:35.688 --> 00:30:37.254
Huh?

00:30:37.254 --> 00:30:39.054
You're going to Sinjusa Temple too?

00:30:39.054 --> 00:30:40.288
Why are you going there?

00:30:40.288 --> 00:30:43.221
To fetch his betrothed.

00:30:47.095 --> 00:30:48.954
Oh.

00:30:48.954 --> 00:30:52.688
So you have a betrothed.

00:30:52.688 --> 00:30:55.254
Well... Not exactly...

00:30:55.254 --> 00:30:56.588
What I mean is...

00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:59.721
I need to pack some luggage.

00:31:06.488 --> 00:31:11.221
Why don't you just walk around
with a sign that says 'Crown Prince is a fool'?

00:31:11.221 --> 00:31:12.554
What for?

00:31:12.554 --> 00:31:13.988
The whole capital already knows.

00:31:13.988 --> 00:31:16.188
But lately, you...

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:19.613
Jeez.

00:31:20.288 --> 00:31:22.721
Are we traveling with that porter?

00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:26.988
Since we're going the same way,
we'll naturally travel together.

00:31:32.954 --> 00:31:35.421
Speaking of which...

00:31:35.421 --> 00:31:39.254
I've ordered the guards
to keep your identity secret.

00:31:39.254 --> 00:31:41.554
Wait, how did you know what I wanted to say?

00:31:41.554 --> 00:31:45.588
Didn't you worry before
that porter might recognize

00:31:45.588 --> 00:31:48.088
Your Highness' true identity?

00:31:49.721 --> 00:31:53.597
Thank you. That punk should learn from you.

00:31:54.788 --> 00:31:56.521
Your Highness.

00:31:56.521 --> 00:31:59.005
Don't forget

00:31:59.005 --> 00:32:01.121
where you're going.

00:32:10.554 --> 00:32:12.388
Young Lady.

00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:24.454
Just nodding her head to greet me?

00:32:24.454 --> 00:32:27.154
Without even coming out?

00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:31.154
If women are that beautiful,
they don't need to move.

00:32:31.154 --> 00:32:33.821
Men should approach them.

00:32:34.454 --> 00:32:36.421
You are lucky, my lord.

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:38.054
To think such peerless beauty is your betrothed.

00:32:38.054 --> 00:32:39.654
Peerless beauty?

00:32:39.654 --> 00:32:42.054
You're even prettier.

00:32:54.188 --> 00:32:57.588
Why is there a Buddha statue in such a place?

00:32:57.588 --> 00:32:59.054
Wow.

00:32:59.054 --> 00:33:01.654
Where else would Buddha statues be but temples?

00:33:01.654 --> 00:33:03.288
Where indeed?

00:33:03.288 --> 00:33:05.388
Why this sudden nonsense?

00:33:05.388 --> 00:33:07.421
I was startled.

00:33:08.988 --> 00:33:11.721
Do many noble ladies visit here?

00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:13.654
I heard the Left Minister's daughter visits too.

00:33:13.654 --> 00:33:16.454
That's the Left Minister's daughter.

00:33:16.454 --> 00:33:20.288
Ah, so all his daughters are here?

00:33:20.288 --> 00:33:21.654
Daughters?

00:33:21.654 --> 00:33:24.054
He has only one daughter.

00:33:24.054 --> 00:33:25.854
That lady there.

00:33:45.221 --> 00:33:48.021
Your prayer seems intense.

00:33:48.021 --> 00:33:50.321
You haven't stood up despite seeing me.

00:33:50.321 --> 00:33:51.688
Yes.

00:33:51.688 --> 00:33:54.388
It must be a prayer that has to be fulfilled.

00:33:54.388 --> 00:33:59.688
If you have something to say,
shall we meet at the cliff edge after one shijin?

00:33:59.688 --> 00:34:04.388
Wow, why the cliff edge?

00:34:05.054 --> 00:34:07.121
Why there?

00:34:07.121 --> 00:34:09.488
Planning to push me off?

00:34:09.488 --> 00:34:11.888
I won't do something as foolish as that.

00:34:11.888 --> 00:34:14.621
The view from there is breathtaking.

00:34:14.621 --> 00:34:19.421
Since you came this far,
enjoy the scenery while you can.

00:34:24.554 --> 00:34:26.921
Are you a good person?

00:34:32.454 --> 00:34:33.754
How do I look?

00:34:33.754 --> 00:34:36.288
Does it seem like just a simple question?

00:34:36.288 --> 00:34:38.754
I'm a wicked person.

00:34:43.921 --> 00:34:45.654
How fortunate.

00:34:45.654 --> 00:34:49.988
Had you been a saint, I might've felt guilty.

00:34:57.254 --> 00:34:59.914
I'm just glad

00:34:59.914 --> 00:35:02.388
that I'm bad.

00:35:05.788 --> 00:35:08.088
Go ahead and finish what you were doing.

00:35:13.288 --> 00:35:15.121
Ah.

00:35:16.721 --> 00:35:18.988
Don't pray too fervently.

00:35:18.988 --> 00:35:23.888
The Buddha doesn't answer
the prayers of wicked people.

00:35:34.154 --> 00:35:35.988
Excuse me...

00:35:36.688 --> 00:35:38.554
What now...

00:35:39.388 --> 00:35:41.088
Who are you?

00:35:41.088 --> 00:35:44.388
Prince Je Woon sent me.

00:35:46.454 --> 00:35:49.254
You are the daughter
of the Left Minister, correct?

00:35:50.488 --> 00:35:53.854
Prince Je Woon has a message for you.

00:36:08.291 --> 00:36:10.121
[My early congratulations
on your royal marriage, Crown Princess.]

00:36:24.954 --> 00:36:28.221
Perhaps because this is a mountain,

00:36:28.221 --> 00:36:30.721
the wind cuts bitterly here.

00:36:32.154 --> 00:36:34.721
My eyes sting from the cold.

00:36:38.788 --> 00:36:41.621
Then I'll take my leave now.

00:36:41.621 --> 00:36:43.454
Stop.

00:36:47.754 --> 00:36:50.054
You take this path straight down the mountain.

00:36:50.054 --> 00:36:53.054
Pardon? The sun's already set.

00:36:53.054 --> 00:36:54.621
Go.

00:36:54.621 --> 00:36:55.988
This is your payment for the errand.

00:36:55.988 --> 00:36:56.988
Well...

00:36:56.988 --> 00:36:58.821
Go.

00:36:59.921 --> 00:37:01.754
Understood.

00:37:14.254 --> 00:37:15.354
You're here.

00:37:15.354 --> 00:37:17.588
Come take a bowl while it's hot.

00:37:19.321 --> 00:37:22.454
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

00:37:22.454 --> 00:37:23.788
Serves you right, you fool!

00:37:23.788 --> 00:37:26.454
I told you not to pick every raspberry you see.

00:37:26.454 --> 00:37:29.221
And you swallowed them whole without chewing.

00:37:29.221 --> 00:37:31.954
How do you expect your stomach to hold up?

00:37:31.954 --> 00:37:34.088
Jeez.

00:37:34.088 --> 00:37:37.654
Why is the eunuch so obsessed
with food that's good for men?

00:37:37.654 --> 00:37:40.054
I truly can't comprehend it.

00:37:40.854 --> 00:37:43.154
Eunuchs are still men.

00:37:44.088 --> 00:37:46.388
Goodness.

00:37:46.388 --> 00:37:49.254
That was an inconsiderate thing to say.

00:37:49.254 --> 00:37:51.388
What? Why?

00:37:51.388 --> 00:37:53.254
It's not incorrect.

00:37:53.254 --> 00:37:55.354
Just because something is true
doesn't mean it's right.

00:37:55.354 --> 00:37:57.521
Your father was my mentor,

00:37:57.521 --> 00:37:58.721
not you.

00:37:58.721 --> 00:38:01.341
It's my father's teaching.

00:38:03.421 --> 00:38:06.688
Goodness, is one shijin already up?

00:38:06.688 --> 00:38:09.154
I should take a short walk.

00:38:09.154 --> 00:38:11.321
Everyone, eat your fill and rest.

00:38:11.321 --> 00:38:13.121
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:38:22.654 --> 00:38:26.288
Where could this fellow be hiding?

00:38:27.554 --> 00:38:29.954
My lord.

00:38:29.954 --> 00:38:32.754
Have you seen the secret inspector?

00:38:32.754 --> 00:38:34.588
Over there.

00:38:42.354 --> 00:38:43.954
What did you just say?

00:38:43.954 --> 00:38:46.754
I refuse this royal marriage.

00:38:46.754 --> 00:38:50.221
It seems you don't understand the meaning of it.

00:38:50.221 --> 00:38:52.221
This is not just a match between the two of us.

00:38:52.221 --> 00:38:56.021
The Left Minister wants
the Royal Father-in-Law's seat. I want his power.

00:38:56.021 --> 00:38:57.705
That is

00:38:57.705 --> 00:39:00.221
the reason for our marriage.

00:39:01.854 --> 00:39:04.354
My lack of personal feelings

00:39:04.354 --> 00:39:06.321
is precisely why I decline.

00:39:06.321 --> 00:39:08.454
Do you think I harbor any affection here for you?

00:39:08.454 --> 00:39:12.921
Hence, Your Highness must withdraw the proposal.

00:39:16.054 --> 00:39:19.321
Then how about this?

00:39:23.988 --> 00:39:27.188
What if I try to love you sincerely?

00:39:27.188 --> 00:39:29.757
The women I love

00:39:29.757 --> 00:39:31.921
always end up dead.

00:39:34.254 --> 00:39:35.973
Who do you think

00:39:36.733 --> 00:39:39.088
killed them?

00:39:49.154 --> 00:39:52.021
Ugh, how embarrassing...

00:39:54.021 --> 00:39:57.354
Then... I'll take my leave now.

00:39:57.354 --> 00:40:02.454
Please tell the inspector that I will never
go to Hanyang again, so there is no need to worry.

00:40:02.454 --> 00:40:04.788
I hope you're doing well, too.

00:40:08.688 --> 00:40:11.254
Why did he act so sweet when he already

00:40:11.254 --> 00:40:14.054
has a woman to carry in the flower palanquin?

00:40:14.054 --> 00:40:15.921
He's just confusing people.

00:40:16.888 --> 00:40:19.221
Do you know

00:40:20.588 --> 00:40:23.121
what that remark implies?

00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:26.288
Your Highness and I understand it well, don't we?

00:40:26.288 --> 00:40:30.688
Is that why you intend to take me as your consort?

00:40:30.688 --> 00:40:33.654
To exact revenge on my father.

00:40:33.654 --> 00:40:36.221
I'm sorry, but I have no such intention.

00:40:36.221 --> 00:40:39.921
I'm sick of being anyone's pawn.

00:40:39.921 --> 00:40:41.693
Truthfully,

00:40:42.397 --> 00:40:44.788
I'm not even sorry.

00:40:47.088 --> 00:40:50.521
Having made myself clear, I'll retire.

00:40:50.521 --> 00:40:53.588
You must be exhausted.

00:40:54.988 --> 00:40:57.988
Sleep long and deep.

00:41:44.088 --> 00:41:48.154
A tiger should at least leave one paw behind.

00:41:48.154 --> 00:41:51.421
If I become tiger food and end up
rolling down the mountain path,

00:41:51.421 --> 00:41:54.921
that's when he'll realize, because of him,

00:41:54.921 --> 00:41:58.121
the good peddler died, and shed tears of regret.

00:41:58.121 --> 00:41:59.821
Speaking of which,

00:41:59.821 --> 00:42:04.221
does the inspector know about this love triangle?

00:42:08.554 --> 00:42:10.109
Maybe

00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:13.121
I should've at least bowed to him before I left?

00:42:13.121 --> 00:42:16.721
I never even thanked him for saving me
from Jangmunhyeong punishment.

00:42:17.388 --> 00:42:18.721
Has she already left?

00:42:18.721 --> 00:42:23.254
Yes. She said to tell you not to worry,
as she won't go to Hanyang.

00:42:23.254 --> 00:42:25.488
How can I not worry?

00:42:25.488 --> 00:42:28.388
Even for the most experienced porter
who knows every river and mountain route,

00:42:28.388 --> 00:42:30.421
this terrain is so treacherous.

00:42:30.421 --> 00:42:32.054
How could she wander off so recklessly...

00:42:32.054 --> 00:42:34.954
Wait, where did she go?

00:42:52.488 --> 00:42:54.388
Who sent them?

00:42:54.388 --> 00:42:56.288
I'll try to stop them somehow.

00:42:56.288 --> 00:42:58.154
Take cover with the young lady.

00:42:58.154 --> 00:42:59.454
Don't put on airs.

00:42:59.454 --> 00:43:02.554
How do you plan to handle this many alone?

00:43:03.321 --> 00:43:04.754
Save me.

00:43:04.754 --> 00:43:07.221
Didn't you say you wanted me dead?

00:43:07.221 --> 00:43:10.588
To kill me, I need to stay alive first.

00:43:13.721 --> 00:43:16.154
Your Highness, hurry!

00:43:21.988 --> 00:43:23.354
Wait a moment.

00:43:23.354 --> 00:43:25.421
I'll return shortly.

00:43:37.539 --> 00:43:38.665
[Daeungjeon Hall]

00:43:49.154 --> 00:43:51.454
Do not come out under any circumstances.

00:43:51.454 --> 00:43:53.588
Don't make a sound.

00:44:03.288 --> 00:44:05.554
How can you laugh in this situation?

00:44:05.554 --> 00:44:07.254
Isn't this absurd?

00:44:07.254 --> 00:44:12.421
Just moments ago, you wanted to kill me.
Now you're saving me.

00:44:13.621 --> 00:44:15.188
As you said, you must remain alive

00:44:15.188 --> 00:44:19.421
so that I may kill you with my own hands
someday, whether tomorrow or next year.

00:44:19.421 --> 00:44:21.621
So, you shall live today.

00:44:58.388 --> 00:45:00.221
Oh Shin Won.

00:45:04.054 --> 00:45:06.221
Yes, Your Highness.

00:45:57.554 --> 00:45:59.488
Left Guard Officer Oh Shin Won!

00:45:59.488 --> 00:46:00.754
Yes, Your Highness.

00:46:00.754 --> 00:46:03.654
From now on, run like

00:46:03.654 --> 00:46:05.021
your life depends on it!

00:46:05.021 --> 00:46:06.821
Seriously?

00:46:16.021 --> 00:46:18.688
If we go a bit further, there's a beacon tower.

00:46:18.688 --> 00:46:19.688
Hold on.

00:46:19.688 --> 00:46:20.721
Let's go that way.

00:46:20.721 --> 00:46:22.554
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:46:23.288 --> 00:46:25.088
Let's go.

00:46:43.654 --> 00:46:46.354
Did they know we'd reach the beacon tower?

00:46:46.354 --> 00:46:48.121
We need to light a fire.

00:46:48.121 --> 00:46:50.388
This is exactly why

00:46:50.388 --> 00:46:53.321
a person must learn.

00:47:04.721 --> 00:47:07.188
The people's hardships finally bear meaning.

00:47:07.188 --> 00:47:09.688
Don't hang out with Yoon Se Dol from now on.

00:47:22.421 --> 00:47:23.854
I feel a chill.

00:47:23.854 --> 00:47:26.421
A dagger seems to fly and lodge in my chest.

00:47:26.421 --> 00:47:29.388
It feels like it might pierce
my back rather than my chest.

00:48:31.421 --> 00:48:33.254
Your Highness.

00:49:08.588 --> 00:49:11.454
Please stop insisting on
traveling with minimal guards.

00:49:11.454 --> 00:49:12.621
I'm exhausted.

00:49:12.621 --> 00:49:14.688
Growth comes through hardships.

00:49:14.688 --> 00:49:17.821
Any more growth now would just be aging.

00:49:54.988 --> 00:49:56.821
Shin Won.

00:49:57.688 --> 00:49:59.521
Shin Won.

00:50:04.988 --> 00:50:06.588
Shin Won.

00:50:06.588 --> 00:50:09.188
- Your Highness.
- No.

00:50:09.188 --> 00:50:10.821
You mustn't go, Shin Won.

00:50:10.821 --> 00:50:12.154
You mustn't go like this.

00:50:12.154 --> 00:50:14.821
You mustn't go like this, Shin Won.

00:50:18.188 --> 00:50:19.988
Fine.

00:50:21.254 --> 00:50:23.321
You must be weary.

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:27.688
Get some rest.

00:50:27.688 --> 00:50:32.188
I-I'll support you and take you...

00:51:51.788 --> 00:51:55.521
Your Highness.

00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:58.721
Left Guard Officer!

00:51:58.721 --> 00:52:00.354
Left Guard Officer!

00:52:00.354 --> 00:52:03.588
Left Guard Officer, open your eyes.

00:52:05.221 --> 00:52:07.854
Jeez, you startled me.

00:52:08.488 --> 00:52:10.654
Left Guard Officer.

00:52:12.154 --> 00:52:14.454
- What a relief.
- Your Highness.

00:52:14.454 --> 00:52:16.288
Your Highness.

00:52:16.288 --> 00:52:18.154
Your Highness.

00:52:18.154 --> 00:52:21.188
Your Highness... Why look for him there?

00:52:21.188 --> 00:52:23.988
His Highness was shot.

00:52:25.021 --> 00:52:26.821
Your Highness.

00:52:35.588 --> 00:52:37.188
Left Guard Officer.

00:52:37.188 --> 00:52:39.454
This...

00:52:39.454 --> 00:52:42.521
His Highness... surely is not...

00:52:44.754 --> 00:52:46.821
Right?

00:52:58.354 --> 00:53:01.254
Your Highness.

00:53:03.421 --> 00:53:05.954
Your Highness.

00:53:08.621 --> 00:53:10.021
Your Majesty.

00:53:10.021 --> 00:53:13.454
The Left Minister's daughter
witnessed His Highness fall

00:53:13.454 --> 00:53:16.121
from the cliff with her own eyes.

00:53:16.121 --> 00:53:19.121
Therefore, waiting for His Highness now...

00:53:19.121 --> 00:53:20.388
Surely you're not suggesting

00:53:20.388 --> 00:53:24.829
to appoint Prince Je Woon as Crown Prince

00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:25.988
amidst this crisis?

00:53:25.988 --> 00:53:29.788
Do not insult the loyal hearts that care
for the ancestral shrines and the state.

00:53:29.788 --> 00:53:31.221
Moreover, in the current situation,

00:53:31.221 --> 00:53:34.121
there's no alternative but Prince Je Woon.

00:53:34.121 --> 00:53:37.454
[Boryeong: A respectful term for the king's age]
Your Majesty has passed forty years of age.

00:53:37.454 --> 00:53:39.821
It is time for a royal marriage.

00:53:39.821 --> 00:53:42.521
- What nonsense is this?
- Well, that might be acceptable.

00:53:42.521 --> 00:53:44.288
How bold you are.

00:53:44.288 --> 00:53:48.488
How dare you mention royal marriage
before His Majesty who lost his son?

00:53:48.488 --> 00:53:49.754
How utterly disgraceful.

00:53:49.754 --> 00:53:52.021
Enough. Observe decorum.

00:53:52.021 --> 00:53:53.521
What? Disgraceful?

00:53:53.521 --> 00:53:54.921
You truly...

00:53:54.921 --> 00:53:56.288
Dare to challenge me?

00:53:56.288 --> 00:53:58.354
Do you think words solve everything?

00:53:58.354 --> 00:54:00.288
Enough!

00:54:01.888 --> 00:54:07.188
How can ministers of state fail
to discern His Majesty's anguish?

00:54:07.188 --> 00:54:10.554
Our apologies, Left Minister.

00:54:40.588 --> 00:54:42.654
Wow, it's a ship!

00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:45.573
Whoosh!

00:55:35.221 --> 00:55:37.954
Something like a human corpse...

00:55:39.354 --> 00:55:41.088
Is that a corpse?

00:55:41.088 --> 00:55:45.721
Finally! The tiger came all the way here.

00:55:45.721 --> 00:55:50.088
Then only bones should remain. Why is it intact?

00:55:50.088 --> 00:55:53.621
Goodness, goodness.

00:56:09.721 --> 00:56:11.521
My lord?

00:56:11.521 --> 00:56:12.721
My lord!

00:56:12.721 --> 00:56:15.321
Wake up!

00:56:16.154 --> 00:56:17.954
What's this?

00:56:20.254 --> 00:56:25.954
You went to marry the Left Minister's
daughter and got shot?

00:56:25.954 --> 00:56:27.788
Jeez.

00:56:29.221 --> 00:56:30.621
Have you seen this man?

00:56:30.621 --> 00:56:33.221
He should've been shot in the chest.

00:56:33.221 --> 00:56:35.054
Huh?

00:56:39.154 --> 00:56:40.421
Well.

00:56:40.421 --> 00:56:43.054
If you see him, you must
report it to the authorities.

00:56:43.054 --> 00:56:44.054
Definitely.

00:56:44.054 --> 00:56:46.154
Yes, travel safely.

00:56:46.154 --> 00:56:48.421
That way. Go that way!

00:56:50.554 --> 00:56:53.121
What crime did he commit?

00:56:54.821 --> 00:56:59.154
If the authorities know he's been shot,
they'll first search all the doctors.

00:57:00.321 --> 00:57:03.654
If we don't go, will he die here?

00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:09.488
Still, this is better than getting caught
and dying without treatment.

00:57:36.637 --> 00:57:38.988
Oh my, oh my.

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:41.321
Why isn't this stopping?

00:57:43.554 --> 00:57:46.269
Oh, heavens. What do I do?

00:57:46.269 --> 00:57:47.654
Wait.

00:57:48.721 --> 00:57:52.188
Why isn't the bleeding stopping?

00:57:54.154 --> 00:57:56.188
Just a moment.

00:57:57.388 --> 00:57:59.454
Endure a little longer.

00:58:10.973 --> 00:58:13.433
Goodness, right.

00:58:15.288 --> 00:58:17.321
Forgive me, my lord.

00:58:32.621 --> 00:58:34.454
I'm sorry.

00:59:21.154 --> 00:59:25.654
If Prince Je Woon is truly appointed
as Crown Prince, it'll be a disaster.

00:59:25.654 --> 00:59:30.288
If we force this royal marriage now,
His Majesty might take his own life.

00:59:30.288 --> 00:59:31.654
Left Minister.

00:59:31.654 --> 00:59:35.221
Making Prince Je Woon
the backup heir carries too many risks.

00:59:35.221 --> 00:59:38.054
The only reason I could control
His Majesty until now

00:59:38.054 --> 00:59:41.321
was because His Majesty
had the Crown Prince as his weakness.

00:59:41.321 --> 00:59:43.988
Now His Majesty has no such vulnerability.

00:59:43.988 --> 00:59:46.388
Then do you intend to leave things as they are?

00:59:46.388 --> 00:59:47.954
If the Crown Prince is dead,

00:59:47.954 --> 00:59:51.854
it would be the natural course
for Prince Je Woon to succeed to the throne.

00:59:51.854 --> 00:59:56.688
Was His Majesty ever the one rightfully
next in line to sit on the throne?

00:59:56.688 --> 00:59:59.021
Do you mean...

00:59:59.021 --> 01:00:03.854
Are you saying you might even kill Prince Je Woon?

01:00:15.988 --> 01:00:19.554
Father, I'm here.

01:00:21.421 --> 01:00:23.321
What did you just say?

01:00:23.321 --> 01:00:26.154
I killed the Crown Prince.

01:00:26.154 --> 01:00:31.188
To make Prince Je Woon the Crown Prince
and take my place beside him.

01:00:32.154 --> 01:00:33.588
You wouldn't dare.

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:35.688
Yes, he's my true lover.

01:00:35.688 --> 01:00:39.954
How dare you defy my will

01:00:39.954 --> 01:00:42.154
and shatter my dreams?

01:00:42.154 --> 01:00:47.521
Do you know how hard I worked
to become Royal Father-in-Law?

01:00:47.521 --> 01:00:50.254
Yet you dared do this knowing full well?

01:00:50.254 --> 01:00:53.754
I have no intention of thwarting your plans.

01:00:53.754 --> 01:00:55.837
Make Prince Je Woon the Crown Prince,

01:00:55.837 --> 01:00:57.821
and I'll become his Crown Princess.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:00.588
Thus, I'll become the queen of this country.

01:01:00.588 --> 01:01:04.054
Naturally, you'll become Royal Father-in-Law.

01:01:04.054 --> 01:01:07.588
Who permitted you to have your own thoughts?

01:01:07.588 --> 01:01:10.288
I have decided to do so.

01:01:10.288 --> 01:01:12.488
From now on, you should understand this.

01:01:12.488 --> 01:01:15.554
That I am no longer your tool.

01:01:15.554 --> 01:01:18.554
But you are mine.

01:01:19.388 --> 01:01:22.588
You may have crafted the current king,

01:01:22.588 --> 01:01:24.605
but the next king,

01:01:24.605 --> 01:01:27.488
and the one after that,

01:01:27.488 --> 01:01:29.754
will be my creations.

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:35.821
Whether this becomes treason or opportunity

01:01:36.754 --> 01:01:39.188
rests in my hands.

01:02:03.754 --> 01:02:05.688
Are you awake?

01:02:28.654 --> 01:02:31.821
Are you a dream

01:02:31.821 --> 01:02:34.754
or a spirit before me?

01:02:53.788 --> 01:02:56.421
Be it a dream or a spirit,

01:02:57.988 --> 01:03:02.521
whether I'm dead and this is hell, it matters not.

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:06.221
I just wanted to see you even like this.

01:03:07.854 --> 01:03:10.221
My Yeon Wol.

your senses haven't fully returned.

01:03:33.088 --> 01:03:38.154
Well, you did get shot, so it's understandable.

01:03:43.421 --> 01:03:44.869
Careful.

01:03:58.188 --> 01:04:00.754
You saved me?

01:04:02.188 --> 01:04:04.021
Good work.

01:04:04.988 --> 01:04:07.821
Just 'good work'?

01:04:07.821 --> 01:04:10.821
I almost died myself, nursing you day and night

01:04:10.821 --> 01:04:12.121
for fifteen days.

01:04:12.121 --> 01:04:13.854
What?

01:04:13.854 --> 01:04:15.588
Fifteen days?

01:04:15.588 --> 01:04:17.721
Yes, did good, right?

01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:20.021
I must go to Hanyang immediately.

01:04:20.021 --> 01:04:21.921
Find me a horse.

01:04:21.921 --> 01:04:23.621
You'll be handsomely rewarded.

01:04:23.621 --> 01:04:25.788
This is Yeongdeok.

01:04:25.788 --> 01:04:28.088
You can't ride all the way to Hanyang

01:04:28.088 --> 01:04:29.554
in your state.

01:04:29.554 --> 01:04:33.054
That's just inviting the Grim Reaper to take you.

01:04:33.054 --> 01:04:35.088
I'll handle that myself.

01:04:35.088 --> 01:04:37.321
Just hurry and get me a horse.

01:04:39.754 --> 01:04:44.421
If it's urgent, why not send a letter?
