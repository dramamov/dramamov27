WEBVTT

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.780
Did Kim Sun Jae
get the divorce papers signed?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.080
Yes. Her signature is on them.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.020
He's good at that sort of thing, at least.
What's your next move?

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.270
What are you going to do with Lawyer Kim?

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.680
You're not actually planning to marry him,
are you?

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.780
I already told you.
That's not going to happen.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.550
Now I have to decide
whether to use him up or cast him aside.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.950
Now that hunting season's over,
we don't need the hunting dog anymore.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.170
I'll take care of it, so don't you worry.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.240
I won't let you down.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.080
As for Se Ri, your granddaughter,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.220
I'll never let her call
just any man "Dad."

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.150
I wouldn't settle for anyone
less than someone like Ho Se.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.990
That's a relief.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.560
My own flesh and blood can't be calling
some random loser "Father."

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.460
I'll see you later.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.530
Okay. I'll talk to you again.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.700
Why did you do that?

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.170
You let Lawyer Kim listen in on purpose,
didn't you?

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.980
He must be devastated.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.780
Because it's the quickest
and most reliable way.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.580
Instead of hearing it secondhand,
it's better that he heard it himself.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.760
He still seems to be
a very capable right-hand man to CEO Min.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.130
That doesn't make him fit
to be Se Ri's stepfather.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.600
He's too vicious to be the father
of my grandchild.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.700
He won't take it lying down when he learns
you've thrown him out after using him.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.970
As a lawyer, he could take legal action.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.410
Being a lawyer is exactly
why he can't go by the book.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.810
Everything he's done for us
has been illegal,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.550
a sketchy mix of cutting corners
and bending the law.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.580
If he exposes his opponent's secrets,
his own secrets will blow up in his face.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.950
Is he really going to do that?
Not unless he's on a suicide mission.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.120
So you manipulated CEO Min...

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.020
just to dump him
once he got the papers signed?

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.630
Of course.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.000
Is this what they call
killing two birds with one stone?

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.030
I got rid of both Lucia and Kim Sun Jae
in one fell swoop.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.340
Tae Joo, how about we go somewhere nice
and get something delicious to eat?

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.080
I'm starving all of a sudden.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.150
How about some spicy stir-fried octopus?

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.230
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.640
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.650
So this is how
you're getting rid of me, Min Kyung Chae?

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.490
So you two were in on it together
the whole time?

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.030
You dare use me like this! How dare you!

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.300
After everything I've done for you?

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.270
Fine. You two have fun.
Let's see how far you get.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.070
You probably think Jang Yeon Sook
is your savior right now.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.040
You may think she makes you invincible,
but you're dead wrong.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.580
As long as I have this in my hands,
nothing will go according to your plan.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.810
Just you wait.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.920
The person you have called is unavailable.
You will be forwarded to their voicemail.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.260
Seriously, where could he be
and what is he doing?

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.830
He's not even picking up his phone.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.530
(Mingang Distribution)

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.710
Kim Sun Jae, you mean?

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.610
I'm not sure what happened,
but he looked terrible.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.620
It didn't seem like an off-site meeting.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.650
It looked like he was
just storming out of the office.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.360
Why would he act like that?
He should be ecstatic.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.360
Just a little while ago,

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.030
I signed the divorce papers for him.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.500
So you finally signed them.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.440
Now I need to think about our next move.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.910
Knowing Kim Sun Jae,
he'll use the law to his advantage.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.740
Regardless of what Kim Sun Jae does,
our job now...

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.450
is to prove that Chairman Min Doo Sik
was forced to stamp those papers,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.620
so we can get the divorce nullified.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.790
Then, we need to find out
where Chairman Min is.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.420
Even if the papers are filed,
the divorce isn't finalized right away,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.260
so try not to worry.
Let's focus on what we can do.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.630
Let's think about where they could be
keeping Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.170
If Tae Joo were on the case like before,

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.800
we would've found him in no time.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.640
What can we do?

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.410
If our ties with Jang Yeon Sook
are cut,

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.440
his connection to us is severed as well.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.480
Darn it.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.920
How much longer do I have to waste my time
on these useless proposals?

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.820
This is grunt work.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.090
I'm about to become a director.
And I'm stuck doing this nonsense?

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.790
Seriously...

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.560
What are you muttering to yourself about?

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.170
About these proposals...

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.000
Can't someone else do this?

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.100
You're Vice Director, so you should do it.
Who else would do it?

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.370
There's no one else here either.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.640
Everyone else is busy with meetings,
business trips, and their own tasks.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.410
So the person who isn't busy should do it.
Am I supposed to do it?

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.880
The one who "isn't busy?"

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.650
Look here, Director Moon Tae Kyung.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.220
Are you really that clueless?

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.690
You have no idea who you're messing with.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.120
Don't you know your place?

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.560
Excuse me?
Who is it that doesn't know their place?

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.990
What are you going to be
that's got you acting so high and mighty?

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.960
I'm about to become...

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.930
Anyway, I'm about to move up,

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.040
so stop giving me a hard time.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.010
You don't want to regret it later.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.380
Why are you always popping in and out
of my office lately?

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.890
I was just wondering what the air was like
in the director's office...

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.260
and to check out the decor.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.330
By the way, you've had Secretary Kang
for a long time, right?

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.290
What's he like? Is he any good?

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.260
If he's good, I might just keep him on.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.630
Why would you need my personal secretary?

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.870
Don't you know you have to be at least
an executive to have your own secretary?

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.210
Also, this is my office.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.780
Go back and enjoy the air over
at the online team.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.810
Gosh, that mouth of yours.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.380
Is it a crime for me to get a whiff
of the air in here?

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.750
Just because this is your office now
doesn't mean it'll be yours forever.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.650
Get real!

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.920
Have you no self-awareness?

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.030
The only way you'll get my seat
is when the inferno freezes over.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.360
Then what are you going to do?

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.800
Because it seems
the inferno has already frozen over.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.270
What's that supposed to mean?

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.900
Kyung Chae... I mean, the CEO...

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.840
said she's kicking you out
and giving me your position.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.480
- Says who?
- The CEO, of course.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.710
Right, Ja Kyung and I decided to give
our entire stake to Kyung Chae.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.680
You see where this is going, don't you?

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.350
Father's incapacitated, so he can't vote.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.660
And if that happens,

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.790
Kyung Chae becomes
the majority shareholder.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.530
Kyung Chae is going to be
the majority shareholder?

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.300
Do you get it now?
You totally backed the wrong horse.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.230
That woman, Lucia? Her career is over.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.540
If you hadn't sided with her
before the emergency shareholder meeting,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.040
none of this would have happened.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.680
Darn it.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.220
What was Ji Seop just telling me?

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.420
Did you really decide
to give him my position?

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.960
It's not like that position
had your name on it.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.690
It should go to whoever
is better for the job.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.330
You're doing this because...

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.060
I said I'd support Lucia
with my shares, aren't you?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.130
But I never thought
you'd actually go this far.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.800
We may fight like we're enemies,
but we're still family.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.210
If you didn't want to take my side,
you should have at least remained neutral.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.010
How could you possibly side with her?

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.480
Look at how she's torn apart
our family and this company.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.580
Please, reconsider.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.480
I won't give my stake to her.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.950
Just let me keep my job as director.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.260
No, it's too late.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.430
That's always your problem.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.490
You're always one step behind.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.200
- Are you really going to do this?
- Get out!

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.970
Now go be a good director
for the little time you have left.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.390
Chairman Min.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.960
Do you see what this is, don't you?

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.200
All I have to do is file this,

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.530
and you and Lucia will be
nothing to each other.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.770
See? The bond of marriage means nothing.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.740
Of course, when you eventually wake up,

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.540
you could claim...

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.410
the thumbprint on the forms
wasn't made of your own free will...

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.410
and get the divorce nullified.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.750
But that's a process, and it takes time.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.190
And by then, Min Kyung Chae will have
already taken everything.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.130
Even for you, going up against her
won't be easy.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.760
But as long as I have this,

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.470
that changes everything.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.270
You're Kyung Chae's dog.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.540
But I wonder how long
you'll stay on her side.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.110
I know exactly
what kind of person Min Kyung Chae is.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.450
That's why I'm going to start
doing things my own way.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.750
I'm not going to be a hound that's used
for a season and then abandoned,

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.020
but a mad dog that turns on its master.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.210
So Kyung Chae is
really promoting you soon, right?

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.410
That's what I said.
Why are you so skeptical?

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.680
She said once she deals with Soo Jung,
she'll give me the position.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.180
Unbelievable.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.520
Everything is just falling into place.
Right, darling?

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.220
Honestly, who would've thought
we'd end up on Kyung Chae's side?

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.130
That's how know-it-all Soo Jung
got left out.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.800
By the way, did you tell your parents
about my promotion?

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.130
Of course. Mom and Dad are thrilled.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.070
No, wait. That's not enough.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.040
We should visit
your dad's restaurant tomorrow.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.610
It's about time I did my part
as a son-in-law.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.240
- Okay, should we?
- Yes.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.020
What Ji Seop said is true.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.690
There's going to be
a management shake-up soon.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.620
So does that mean you're really
getting pushed out?

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.320
I mean,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.320
are you getting fired?

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.030
It seems my sister
has already made up her mind.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.300
Wait, what's going to happen to me?

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.930
I'm your only ally at the company.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.970
CEO Min is really taking this too far.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.670
I mean, to her own sister...

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.070
Wait...

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.570
You're not going to let this slide,
are you?

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.910
Of course not.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.180
It's time I exposed
CEO Min Kyung Chae's weakness.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.720
Her weakness?

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.390
And what's that?

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.690
Se Ri is her daughter.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.130
You mean Miss Se Ri!

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.730
It's just a hunch, though.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.370
Everything's okay at the house today,
right?

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.040
You know you always call around this time?

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.410
That's because this is when
I start to worry.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.610
It's when everyone in that house
is usually together.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.440
It's like you're sleeping with the enemy.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:31.180
Surrounded by those terrifying Mins,
I worry if you can even breathe.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:35.020
I'm breathing, eating,
and sleeping just fine,

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.290
so don't you worry.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.360
Every day must feel like
you're walking on eggshells.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.420
Every single moment must be torment.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.030
Living under the same roof
with people like them.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.760
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.030
But I'm the one who's not okay with it.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.770
Min Kyung Chae already showed up
with divorce papers.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.540
I can just imagine how they must be
treating you over there.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.980
I'm okay for now,
so stop worrying and get some rest.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.950
The moment I'm not okay,
I'll let you know.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.180
I'll say, "Please, get me out of here."

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.390
All right. Rest well,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.510
Tae Joo, it's me.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.080
- Moon Tae Kyung.
- Yes, go ahead.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.950
If Madam Jang is there with you,
just listen.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.050
All right.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.790
If you're free tomorrow,

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.460
could we meet briefly?

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.460
Me? Why?

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.190
You should know why I'm asking to see you.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.860
It won't take long.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.570
Please come for Lucia's sake
and the bond you two shared.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.140
You can pick the time and place.
Whatever's convenient.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.300
- Who was that?
- Just someone I know.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.930
They want to meet tomorrow
about something.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.600
Who is this person you know?

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.640
It's no one you know, Mother.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.270
Is that so?

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.350
Since it's come to this,

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.150
all I have to do is prove Min Kyung Chae
and Min Se Ri are mother and daughter.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.590
If I can prove it's not just my suspicion,
but a fact,

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.130
then I can turn the tables
back in my favor.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.510
What are you hiding behind your back?

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.310
Hiding? What would I be hiding?

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:16.980
I'm sure you just hid something.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.220
I told you I didn't.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.750
Fine, if you say so.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.590
Why aren't you heading to work today?

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.260
I'm going to in a little while.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.800
This is so annoying!
Why is it gone again?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.470
What's wrong? Has something gone missing?

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.440
My toothbrush. Why is it missing again?

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.010
I'm sure someone stole it!

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:47.480
Look again carefully.
Who would want a used toothbrush?

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.980
That's what I thought,
so I brought them all out, see?

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.250
Look. Where's mine?

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.050
Why did you bring out
everyone's toothbrushes?

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.690
Because I'm annoyed!
It went missing last time, too.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.630
Here, let me see. I'll help you find it.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:06.300
Not this one...

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.470
What?

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.500
Wait. Come to think of it,
Kyung Chae's is missing too.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.370
You're right. Kyung Chae's is gone too.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.280
Who on earth took
Kyung Chae's toothbrush and mine?

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.760
I have Se Ri's and Kyung Chae's
toothbrushes now.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.930
If we can use these
to prove they're mother and daughter,

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.640
then we'll get another chance.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.770
Even if CEO Min...

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.840
really is Se Ri's birth mother,
how can we use that against her?

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.780
We'll publicly reveal...

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.050
that Se Ri is
CEO Min Kyung Chae's illegitimate child...

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.250
and that she's built her image
as a "career woman"...

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.150
with a pristine private life.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.350
So she deserves
a huge public humiliation.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.960
Should we have the Board of Directors
make an issue of it?

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.260
We need to blow this thing wide open.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.630
We'll shake things up and attack her
until her CEO position is at risk.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.500
We have to do everything we possibly can.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.870
We'll leak it to the press
and mobilize an army of online trolls.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.810
What should I do?
She just got her CEO position back.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.010
I can't let something go wrong
for her again now.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:40.790
This one belongs to Madam Jung.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.090
This should do the trick, right?

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.270
What is it? Why didn't you knock?

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.610
Where is my head?
I was in such a rush, I forgot.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.710
I wanted to get you some breakfast
before you leave for work.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.680
I don't have an appetite, so please leave.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.980
But if you don't eat breakfast,
you'll be starving before lunch.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.950
Please, have some.
I made your favorite croaker soup.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.220
Since when is croaker soup my favorite?

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.830
I'm telling you, I'm really not hungry.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.360
Don't be like that.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.460
At least have one bite for the person
who prepared it. Please?

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.400
- Come on.
- Goodness!

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.900
- Please, have one bite before you go.
- I said I'm not hungry!

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.600
You have to eat before you leave.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.140
I hate it croaker soup!

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.980
- But you really should eat first.
- What are you going on about?

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.180
Here, sit down.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.180
Here you go.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.750
Here you are.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.420
Go on, dig in.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.850
Gosh, you're so thin.
I'm worried about you.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.890
Don't worry about me.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:47.720
I may be thin,
but I'm tougher than I look.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.990
Finish the whole bowl.
Don't make me get mad.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.860
Take your time and chew properly.
Now, eat up.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.200
Okay.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.660
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.760
The person you are calling
is unavailable...

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.900
The person you have called is unavailable.
Please leave a message...

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.340
Kim Sun Jae.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.170
Why on earth aren't you
answering my calls?

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:38.710
Since yesterday.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.510
Legal said they haven't heard
from him either.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.610
What do you think he's up to?

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.320
Does Min Kyung Chae know about this?

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.520
No, I don't think she does.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.820
Seeing the CEO's secretary called Legal
to check if he had come in.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.400
(Mo Tae Joo)

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.670
Let's meet at Lucepé at
the Mucheon Roundabout in an hour.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.400
What's that text about?

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.470
It's nothing.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.510
Thank you...

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.350
for agreeing to meet me.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.420
Don't mention it.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.080
I've been wanting to meet you
and talk to you as well.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.050
Mother.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.660
You call her Madam Jang, I believe.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.600
As I'm always by her side, I know better
than anyone that she's on a rampage.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.630
Which is why...

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.470
I have a favor to ask you.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.300
This will probably be a difficult favor
for you to grant.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.810
I came here fully prepared
for you to refuse,

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.240
so please don't feel pressured.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.410
Somehow, I think I already know
what it is.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:55.490
So, Lawyer Kim has been out of contact
and disappeared since yesterday?

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:56.790
Yes.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.590
Seeing how he left dropping a bouquet
and a proposal ring right there,

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:02.690
I'm sure something must have
happened suddenly.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.500
So, Kim Sun Jae is human after all.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.730
After finding out his fiancée treated him
like her own personal hound,

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.300
he wouldn't be human if he stuck around.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.410
I suppose something came up.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.540
Why look for someone who wants to hide?
Just let him be.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.450
You think you can't find another lawyer
as good as Kim Sun Jae?

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.690
I'll set you up with a lawyer
who will be helpful to you.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:32.620
A real ace who will be a great help
to our work going forward.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.460
But he's not the type to just disappear
without a word.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.400
I said let's drop the subject
of Kim Sun Jae.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.030
How about we talk about
something more exciting?

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.370
So, did you file for divorce?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.710
- Hello, what can I get for you folks?
- We'll have two goat soups, please.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:49.970
Two goat soups, got it.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.780
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.410
Here you go.
Enjoy your meal.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.780
- Sir!
- Dad!

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:01.850
Mother.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.490
If it isn't the future director
of Mingang Distribution.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.430
But Ji Seop, are you sure
it's a done deal this time?

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.530
This isn't the first time you've been
so sure and then it fell through.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.570
Mom, please.
It's a done deal this time.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.300
Stop being so sour.
Save the vinegar for the food.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.870
So this time it's the real deal, right?

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.770
Yes, I'm telling you.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.840
It's still confidential,
but it's as good as decided.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.610
Soon, I'll be Min Ji Seop,
Director of Mingang Distribution!

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.380
- That's who I'll be.
- Am I dreaming, or is this real?

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:34.850
Ouch!

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.250
Ouch!

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.520
It's real!

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.190
Hooray for the Republic of Korea!
What are you doing? Join in!

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.660
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:43.830
- Hooray!
- Hooray

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.560
Attention, everyone!
We have some great news to celebrate!

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.630
This guy here is my son-in-law,

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.600
and he'll be
a director at Mingang Distribution,

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.940
Korea's number one company.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.200
Let's applaud him!

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.710
- Congratulations!
- Thank you so much.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:57.770
Thank you.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.440
I'm in a great mood.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.350
Everything you're eating is on me!

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:03.950
I'm ringing the golden bell!

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.420
Ringing the golden bell? Are you serious?
That's not just a few bucks.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.190
This is how you're meant to spend money.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.390
And if you all join me for three cheers,

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.190
I'll even throw in a plate
of our boiled pork for everyone!

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.990
- To our Ji Seop, hooray!
- Hooray!

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.830
- Hooray!
- Hooray for our restaurant!

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.970
- Hooray!
- Hooray for Oh Pan Sool!

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.030
- Hooray!
- Hey, bring out the boiled pork.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.600
- Bring it quick!
- All right.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.520
Shouldn't you be at work at this time?

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.220
Are you expecting someone?

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.490
You don't need to know, Manager Gong.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.020
- Are you going to the market?
- Yes, I'm heading to the supermarket.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:47.820
I'll be on my way.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.870
She's really sweating it.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:00.370
She's eager to use that paternity test
to stick it to Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.410
It's not going to go her way.
Not while I'm around. Not a chance.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.220
- Excuse me, do you live here?
- Yes, I do. What is it?

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.690
I have a registered letter for
Ms. Min Soo Jung at this address.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.830
That's the younger miss.
She's inside right now.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.100
Just give it to me.
I'll make sure she gets it.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.460
Thank you.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.910
So this must be the DNA test result.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.380
I don't even have to look.
It's obviously not a match.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.250
After all, Ms. Se Ri and Lucia
aren't blood-related in the slightest.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.550
So the results are a given.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.460
Imagine her disappointment.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.060
Serves her right
for messing with Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.330
An illegitimate child must know her place.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.710
Maybe I'll just take a little peek.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.700
No...

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:37.970
No, but why...

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.340
How can this...

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.240
How can Se Ri and that woman be...

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.850
All right, you're almost there.
Just one more push!

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.230
Goodness, she's the spitting image
of her mother.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.240
Take a look, Kyung Chae.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.510
Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.640
Ms. Kyung Chae?

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.750
Ms. Kyung Chae, stay with me!

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:26.220
Ms. Kyung Chae!

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.250
Why did she suddenly stop crying?

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.760
Darling!

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:50.270
What's wrong?

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.480
Please, help my baby.
She just suddenly stopped crying.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.710
Okay, hold on.
Please get in the ambulance.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.310
As luck would have it,
another mother and her baby are in here.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.980
I can take you to the same hospital.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.720
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:04.720
- This way, please.
- Okay.
