[humming]

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:51.365
Which car did you get?

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:53.950
I think I got screwed.

00:00:54.868 --> 00:00:57.954
I should've kept it fair and given
everyone the same car to race in.

00:00:58.038 --> 00:00:59.122
Ah, those fuckers.

00:01:00.374 --> 00:01:02.417
You got a good one. Sneaky bastard.

00:01:04.127 --> 00:01:05.837
No, I didn't. Fucking idiot.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:11.218
[sighs]

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:14.471
Everyone's busy making secret alliances.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:16.556
I think it's smart.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.310
Anyone who goes up this thing alone
is doomed to fail, don't you think?

00:01:21.603 --> 00:01:23.480
Hey, did you ask for a consultation?

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:25.857
I think I will.

00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:29.194
When I win this, I wanna cut a deal
and see if they'll throw in the car.

00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:30.278
You know what I mean?

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:36.743
Hey.

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:40.372
Are you sure this is safe?

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:44.668
They're watching us.

00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:50.298
My mission is to spy on you,
so they expect us to talk.

00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:52.342
Hey, listen up.

00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:55.053
We should team up together.

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:59.975
If the winner gets five billion,
that's a lot of money

00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:01.476
and all I want is an apartment.

00:02:01.977 --> 00:02:04.271
You can have the rest of the money,
if we win.

00:02:05.397 --> 00:02:06.398
Let's be partners.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.024
I'm not interested.

00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:11.528
Give your grandmother the rest of it.

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:13.363
You know my grandma?

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:17.909
This must be destiny.

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:22.581
It's a good thing you have
that auto mechanic license.

00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:24.499
No, I don't.

00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:25.667
I saw it.

00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:34.134
Listen up.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.345
No matter who wins, we split it.

00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:41.266
I want us working as a team on this.

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:44.019
Which means you do what I tell you.

00:02:44.102 --> 00:02:45.187
Got it?

00:02:46.062 --> 00:02:47.230
-Yeah.
-Yes.

00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:50.066
Stick with me and we can win everything.

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:00.911
Come and sit down.

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.050
Thank you for giving up
some of your valuable time.

00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:19.012
Do Gangjae, you're the first
to request a meeting.

00:03:19.095 --> 00:03:20.096
What's this about?

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:31.525
MID-TO-LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIP

00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:32.734
What's this?

00:03:32.817 --> 00:03:34.361
Just keep me in mind.

00:03:34.444 --> 00:03:36.613
There are many ways
that I could be of service.

00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:38.323
[both laughing]

00:03:39.407 --> 00:03:42.285
I don't think you'd want me
as a mid-to-long-term partner.

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:43.870
[chuckles]

00:03:43.954 --> 00:03:45.038
Yeah, I would.

00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:47.499
[chuckling] You're being
far too humble, sir.

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:52.671
I noticed you've got cameras all over.

00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:54.798
The scale of this operation is no joke.

00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:57.092
And you managed to bring us all here.

00:03:58.051 --> 00:04:00.637
You've even got the warden
afraid to make a move.

00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:02.681
Is that so?

00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:06.309
Yeah. It's obvious to me that
you're the one who's running the show.

00:04:06.393 --> 00:04:08.603
I see the effort
you're putting into this race,

00:04:08.687 --> 00:04:11.356
which means that it must be
a long-term investment.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.275
We should become partners.

00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:14.985
I am the best person for you.

00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:18.738
It would be really good for you
and great for me.

00:04:18.822 --> 00:04:22.325
I'm surprised you don't want money
or an early release.

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:23.493
[chuckles]

00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:26.371
No, I'm not that short-sighted. [laughs]

00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:31.543
I'm not here for the money.
I'm here to network.

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:33.461
Even if I got out, what are the chances

00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:35.839
that I'd meet someone
this powerful on the outside?

00:04:35.922 --> 00:04:38.133
I don't think I have that kind of power.

00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:41.887
You're so coy. It makes you even scarier.

00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:47.017
You've got the kind of money
that allowed you to buy this huge factory

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.644
and turn it into your personal playground.

00:04:49.728 --> 00:04:51.980
I've never met anyone as powerful as you.

00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:58.737
Now, if I may be so bold, sir,

00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:01.948
let me open up my heart
to you for a moment.

00:05:02.032 --> 00:05:05.368
You know what, it says here
you have 18 fraud convictions.

00:05:05.452 --> 00:05:07.329
So you're in the business of flattery.

00:05:08.872 --> 00:05:09.873
Just a minute.

00:05:09.956 --> 00:05:11.958
Are you kissing my ass too?

00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:15.420
[laughing]

00:05:18.632 --> 00:05:20.342
No, I was just kidding. Just kidding.

00:05:22.052 --> 00:05:25.055
Get to know me and you'll find
I can be a very useful toy.

00:05:26.097 --> 00:05:27.599
Please feel free to play with me.

00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:30.810
[both laughing]

00:05:35.523 --> 00:05:36.524
I got it.

00:05:36.608 --> 00:05:37.901
I'll think about it for now.

00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:42.781
Oh, by the way,

00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:47.661
if you require any kind of little
party favors, just let me know.

00:05:47.744 --> 00:05:50.956
I can have grade-A goods delivered
within 30 minutes

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.165
and at any time of day.

00:05:56.586 --> 00:05:58.046
We'll talk later.

00:06:11.768 --> 00:06:16.022
We're both busy men,
so I'll keep this short and to the point.

00:06:16.898 --> 00:06:17.899
Please do so.

00:06:18.817 --> 00:06:22.821
You know all that money
you said you'd give to the winner?

00:06:24.572 --> 00:06:27.909
Well, I would like something else instead.
[chuckles]

00:06:29.703 --> 00:06:31.037
What else would you like?

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.167
Ah, what I really want...

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:42.632
is to kill one of these sons of bitches
with my own hands.

00:06:48.054 --> 00:06:49.806
What's so funny?

00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:54.018
Do you like boxing, by any chance?

00:06:54.102 --> 00:06:57.647
If you were to kill someone
outside the ring, it's murder. But...

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:01.735
when you're inside the ring,
it's just a part of the sport.

00:07:01.818 --> 00:07:02.819
You understand?

00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:06.990
So as long as you're playing the game,
do whatever you want.

00:07:08.074 --> 00:07:10.160
Don't give up on the prize money, either.

00:07:11.035 --> 00:07:13.455
The warden would never approve of this.

00:07:13.538 --> 00:07:17.709
He's too much of a coward,
and he kept telling me not to do it.

00:07:21.087 --> 00:07:22.338
Ahh.

00:07:23.006 --> 00:07:24.883
You, on the other hand,

00:07:25.675 --> 00:07:27.427
are much more fun.

00:07:34.768 --> 00:07:36.019
[sighs]

00:07:36.102 --> 00:07:38.229
I really want this race
to be a lot of fun.

00:07:38.313 --> 00:07:39.773
[♪ dramatic music playing]

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.784
[car engine starts]

00:07:50.867 --> 00:07:52.327
[Jiyong] Damn.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.620
Just look at this thing.

00:07:54.913 --> 00:07:55.997
Yeah.

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:01.753
Don't go around telling other people
this is my car.

00:08:01.836 --> 00:08:03.379
Well, actually...

00:08:03.463 --> 00:08:05.048
[engine revving loudly]

00:08:08.843 --> 00:08:10.428
-This car is trash.
-What?

00:08:13.223 --> 00:08:14.307
Hey.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.684
You jealous?

00:08:18.061 --> 00:08:19.938
Let's take a look at the brake pads.

00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:21.856
Wait. Are you serious?

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.441
What the fuck?

00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:24.609
[metallic thud]

00:08:25.318 --> 00:08:27.195
[groaning] Shit.

00:08:28.363 --> 00:08:29.656
-Give me the keys.
-No way.

[saw whirring]

00:08:36.496 --> 00:08:38.122
-Here.
-Okay, okay!

00:08:38.206 --> 00:08:40.208
-I'll give it you.
-[switches off saw]

00:08:42.752 --> 00:08:43.753
Here it is.

00:08:44.546 --> 00:08:46.047
What, are you angry?

00:08:47.048 --> 00:08:48.842
No, I'm not. I'm not.

00:08:48.925 --> 00:08:50.009
We're cool.

00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:53.346
-Take off the trunk.
-Okay.

00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:54.889
-Put on the rear wing.
-Got it.

00:08:59.185 --> 00:09:00.186
What's this?

00:09:02.188 --> 00:09:03.773
-Can they do that?
-Shit.

00:09:03.857 --> 00:09:05.608
That asshole's just stealing it.

00:09:09.737 --> 00:09:10.738
Wait a minute.

00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:17.412
When they said there would be no rules,
this is what they were talking about.

00:09:18.037 --> 00:09:19.581
Search from the top there.

00:09:19.664 --> 00:09:21.624
-I'm on it.
-Come on.

00:09:23.293 --> 00:09:24.627
What the fuck is this?

00:09:29.883 --> 00:09:31.176
Huh?

00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:32.260
What?

00:09:32.343 --> 00:09:34.470

[panting]

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.816
Number 10 is a sports car.

-Yes.

Hey, get off me, asshole!

00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:25.063
Those fuckers.
I knew they'd pull this shit.

Oh, fuck!

Goddamn, open the fucking door.

No, you're not coming in!

00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:10.710
Fucking bastard!

00:12:13.338 --> 00:12:14.422
If you won't move it...

those bastards?

Oh, shit.

00:12:30.646 --> 00:12:31.731
Bitch.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.902
I talked with my friends in Busan
and I told them about you.

00:12:36.778 --> 00:12:38.279
And now they want to meet you.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.450
You shouldn't be talking about me.

He's not taking this car.

00:12:48.873 --> 00:12:50.208
Not today. [grunts]

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.923
Shit! It's Yeo Deoksu!

00:12:57.006 --> 00:12:59.175
He's right on our tail. You have to hurry!

00:13:01.344 --> 00:13:02.804
Wait, it started already?

00:13:07.767 --> 00:13:10.269
Once we're in the car,
the game has started, right?

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.526
They're so fucking fast, those bastards.

00:13:17.652 --> 00:13:18.903
Shit! This piece of junk.

00:13:18.986 --> 00:13:20.488
Yes, I just saw it.

00:13:20.571 --> 00:13:21.656
Leave him alone.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.174
He's after my car, too.

00:13:40.258 --> 00:13:43.136
We're supposed to be on the same side.
That son of a bitch!

This whole car's gonna fall apart.

This feels so fucking real.

they all get killed? Huh?

Wow, you've really got
a fun life here, huh?

00:15:50.388 --> 00:15:52.181
I hope the main game is even more fun.

00:15:55.476 --> 00:15:56.602
I think that's enough.

00:15:57.645 --> 00:16:00.356
What? Come on. This is fun. Why?

00:16:00.439 --> 00:16:02.191
They can't drive if they get injured.

Your car's completely fucked.

Oh, yeah? So is your face.

Jesus! What a fucking waste of the car.

Fine. I'm going, I'm going.

Hey, you gotta push harder.

I am!

Taejoong...

The car. You can still repair it, right?

00:16:44.483 --> 00:16:46.652
How am I supposed to repair this thing?

00:16:46.736 --> 00:16:49.447
If you can't,
how will I win the prize money for us?

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.949
Hey, push a little harder.
Harder, harder. Harder.

Not bad at all.

Nothing you can't fix.

Go. Quickly.

Move it!

00:19:32.443 --> 00:19:34.737
I enjoyed your practice game last night.

00:19:36.113 --> 00:19:37.198
So...

00:19:37.907 --> 00:19:39.575
why did you request this meeting?

00:19:51.086 --> 00:19:52.505
I was just curious.

00:19:54.006 --> 00:19:55.341
About?

00:19:55.424 --> 00:19:56.425
[Taejoong] Your plan.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.554
This isn't really about a race, is it?

00:20:02.848 --> 00:20:03.933
Why do you say that?

00:20:06.352 --> 00:20:08.854
For starters,
we've all been given different cars.

00:20:09.605 --> 00:20:12.233
There aren't clear rules,
and you keep provoking fights.

00:20:12.316 --> 00:20:15.611
And honestly, a place like this
is not exactly ideal

00:20:15.694 --> 00:20:17.780
for holding a competition, is it?

00:20:18.614 --> 00:20:20.115
You're quite observant.

00:20:20.199 --> 00:20:22.576
It'd be too difficult to do this
with regular people,

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.245
so instead you're using prisoners?

00:20:25.246 --> 00:20:26.539
You're smart too, I guess.

00:20:29.917 --> 00:20:31.418
Tell me why you're doing this.

00:20:37.466 --> 00:20:39.426
Because it's fun. [chuckles]

00:20:53.399 --> 00:20:54.567
What exactly do you need?

00:20:56.485 --> 00:20:57.778
[Taejoong sighs]

00:21:00.573 --> 00:21:01.574
Vitamins.

00:21:01.657 --> 00:21:03.075
Vitamins?

00:21:05.536 --> 00:21:06.787
I prefer vitamins, but...

00:21:08.747 --> 00:21:10.249
all you have here is alcohol.

You heard the guy.

00:21:27.558 --> 00:21:28.809
From the looks of it...

00:21:30.811 --> 00:21:33.272
your friend over there
needs it more than I do.

00:21:38.736 --> 00:21:39.820
Because this

00:21:40.613 --> 00:21:42.072
doesn't really suit my taste.

00:21:55.586 --> 00:21:57.755
It's wilted. Replace it.

00:21:57.838 --> 00:21:58.839
Yes, sir.

go after ruining my car?

[drill whirring]

00:22:56.105 --> 00:22:57.648
Number six, what does he do?

00:22:58.607 --> 00:23:01.777
That guy's useless. You don't have
to worry about him, trust me.

00:23:03.487 --> 00:23:04.613
And number eight?

00:23:04.697 --> 00:23:06.573
He was a tow trucker in Jangan-dong.

00:23:07.616 --> 00:23:09.243
A tow trucker. [chuckles]

00:23:09.326 --> 00:23:10.411
That's surprising.

I'm taking out.

Easy, boss.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.550
Don't worry about Park Taejoong.

00:23:24.633 --> 00:23:26.468
This all ends once we come in first.

00:23:28.512 --> 00:23:31.390
That guy can drive a total wreck
and still win this race.

00:23:32.349 --> 00:23:33.851
What a son of a bitch.

00:23:36.145 --> 00:23:37.187
Does it hurt?

00:23:37.271 --> 00:23:39.273
Oh, this? No, it's nothing.

00:23:39.356 --> 00:23:40.441
And the car?

00:23:42.192 --> 00:23:43.777
They swapped my car for a compact.

00:23:43.861 --> 00:23:46.155
You think I'm just gonna
sit here and take it?

00:23:46.739 --> 00:23:49.616
No fucking way.
So I switched it out with a turbo engine.

00:23:50.576 --> 00:23:53.037
You've got some skills,
you son of a bitch.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.582
That's right. All these other assholes
are gonna choke on my exhaust.

00:23:56.665 --> 00:23:57.791
Just you wait.

00:24:07.634 --> 00:24:08.719

Mr. Do, I think I'm going to
accept your offer.

You won't regret it, sir.
I promise you that.

00:24:53.597 --> 00:24:56.558
I left you a gift
in the back seat of your car.

00:24:56.642 --> 00:25:00.145
And if the race starts to drag,
use it to keep things interesting.

00:25:00.229 --> 00:25:04.108
Think of it as an investment
in a long-term partnership.

00:25:05.484 --> 00:25:08.737
I'm the one person you can count on
to keep things fun for you.

what you're really made of.

00:28:25.976 --> 00:28:27.602
I'll think about it when it's over.

00:28:27.686 --> 00:28:30.355
No matter your vehicle,
put your skills to the test.

00:28:30.439 --> 00:28:31.898
In the end, the car doesn't win.

00:28:31.982 --> 00:28:33.233
You do.

00:28:37.362 --> 00:28:38.572
Get out, asshole.

00:28:38.655 --> 00:28:40.365
You hear me? I said, get out, fucker!

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.619
Hey!

00:28:55.547 --> 00:28:57.257
When it starts, open up the way.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.009
Take out Park Taejoong first.

00:28:59.092 --> 00:29:00.385
You got it, boss. I'm on it.

00:29:06.683 --> 00:29:08.351
Hey, which number did you bet on?

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:10.771
Nine.

00:29:11.605 --> 00:29:13.148
[sighs]

00:29:14.107 --> 00:29:15.484
What a punchable face.

00:29:15.567 --> 00:29:17.152
[both laughing]

00:29:52.938 --> 00:29:54.481
[buzzer sounds]

00:30:02.614 --> 00:30:03.698
Let's go number 9?

00:30:03.782 --> 00:30:06.618
Whoa, number 6, all right! [whooping]

00:30:10.372 --> 00:30:12.332
Shit! All kinds of crap!

00:30:12.415 --> 00:30:14.084
Cool it, you motherfucker!

00:30:17.963 --> 00:30:19.965
Car number 11 is veering off course.

00:30:22.175 --> 00:30:23.385
Follow number 11.

00:30:23.468 --> 00:30:24.719
-Following 11.
-Copy that.

00:30:27.264 --> 00:30:29.015
Fuck you, bitch!

00:30:29.683 --> 00:30:31.434
[engine revving]

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.478
He's fast!

00:30:34.688 --> 00:30:36.064
Ahhh!

00:30:38.775 --> 00:30:41.194
I'm in first! Yeah, I'm in first!

00:30:41.278 --> 00:30:42.821
Fucking stupid bastard!

00:30:47.409 --> 00:30:48.743
Please, no! Please! Oh, shit!

00:30:48.827 --> 00:30:50.287
Oh, no!

00:30:54.166 --> 00:30:55.458
Oh! [laughs]

00:30:59.504 --> 00:31:02.048
Holy shit!
This race is already intense as hell.

00:31:02.132 --> 00:31:03.425
Fucking great!

00:31:03.508 --> 00:31:06.303
[laughing, whooping]

00:31:06.386 --> 00:31:07.888
[Yohan] Where have I seen him?

00:31:28.992 --> 00:31:30.619
[tires screeching]

00:31:38.335 --> 00:31:40.754
Hey, they just finished a full lap, right?

00:31:40.837 --> 00:31:42.714
It looks like it. [laughs]

00:31:47.219 --> 00:31:49.137
[Taejoong] I prefer vitamins, but...

00:31:49.221 --> 00:31:50.805
from the looks of it,

00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:53.600
your friend over there
needs them more than I do.

00:32:00.106 --> 00:32:01.149
Bingo.

00:32:01.233 --> 00:32:02.525
Our culprit.

00:32:05.612 --> 00:32:06.988
No way.

00:32:11.117 --> 00:32:12.118
[thud]

00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:20.168
Do Gangjae. Get Car number 9.

00:32:21.211 --> 00:32:23.463
You don't have to tell me that, I know.

00:32:23.546 --> 00:32:25.048
That bastard's mine.

00:32:29.928 --> 00:32:31.179
[laughing maniacally]

00:32:35.433 --> 00:32:36.518
Number 9, drive!

00:32:36.643 --> 00:32:38.270
Number 6, let's go!

00:32:39.271 --> 00:32:41.439
Yeah. Step on the gas.

00:32:49.364 --> 00:32:50.365
[cheering]

00:32:50.448 --> 00:32:51.866
Who's that fucker, number 5?

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.326
Okay.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.370
What the fuck?

00:32:55.453 --> 00:32:57.038
I wonder what will happen next.

00:32:57.122 --> 00:32:58.456
They're really going at it.

00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.833
I love being fucking rich.

00:32:59.916 --> 00:33:03.211
They think they're gonna die,
so they're all freaking out right now.

00:33:03.295 --> 00:33:04.462
Fucking idiots.

00:33:11.511 --> 00:33:14.723
Look at this guy. Number 6
just pulled off to the side.

00:33:14.806 --> 00:33:16.057
What a move!

00:33:20.186 --> 00:33:21.771
Number 9. He's breaking off first.

00:33:28.528 --> 00:33:29.821
Number 4's chasing number 9.

00:33:29.904 --> 00:33:32.198
Number 6 is charging in
from the other side.

00:33:32.282 --> 00:33:33.325
No!

00:33:33.408 --> 00:33:34.576
You can do it, number 9!

00:33:34.659 --> 00:33:36.578
Come on! Step on it! Go!

00:33:37.746 --> 00:33:38.997
Park Taejoong!

00:33:40.665 --> 00:33:41.958
[yells]

00:33:50.633 --> 00:33:51.801
Oh, fuck that!

00:33:52.886 --> 00:33:55.263
You made a stupid bet.
What are you gonna do?

00:33:55.347 --> 00:33:57.849
That son of a bitch!
I bet so much on this shit, man.

00:34:05.899 --> 00:34:06.900
What's this?

00:34:06.983 --> 00:34:08.818
Hey. Is that a knife?

00:34:08.902 --> 00:34:10.362
-It's a knife.
-[laughing]

00:34:11.988 --> 00:34:12.989
[groaning]

00:34:17.077 --> 00:34:18.828
[man 1] No! Please don't kill him.

00:34:18.912 --> 00:34:20.372
Please kill him.

00:34:20.455 --> 00:34:21.956
Just fucking kill him! Do it!

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.083
[man 1] Let 9 live!

00:34:24.584 --> 00:34:26.211
Boss, wait.

00:34:27.587 --> 00:34:28.880
It's me, Gu Jiyong.

00:34:29.714 --> 00:34:31.674
Park Taejoong. Park Tae--

00:34:32.926 --> 00:34:35.387
[announcer] Car 11's
veering off course again.

00:34:38.098 --> 00:34:39.099
[tires screeching]

00:34:39.182 --> 00:34:41.101
[engine accelerating]

00:34:44.479 --> 00:34:45.855
Don't worry, Grandma.

00:34:45.939 --> 00:34:48.358
I'm gonna get rich,
get out and buy you a house.

00:34:49.984 --> 00:34:51.694
[man] Number 9, take him out!

00:34:59.869 --> 00:35:02.580
-[man] There's no one inside.
-Well, find him then.

00:35:16.428 --> 00:35:17.804
Was that a motorbike?

00:35:17.887 --> 00:35:19.931
[man] Hey, isn't it cheating?

00:35:24.561 --> 00:35:26.229
Park Taejoong.

00:35:42.495 --> 00:35:44.414
Where is he? Motherfucker!

00:36:03.767 --> 00:36:05.059
What the hell?

00:36:05.643 --> 00:36:06.811
Look, there he goes.

00:36:30.835 --> 00:36:32.045
Whoa!

00:36:32.128 --> 00:36:33.505
[laughing]

00:36:35.673 --> 00:36:36.841
What is this?

00:36:37.383 --> 00:36:40.011
Holy shit! Number 9 looks so cool!

00:36:45.475 --> 00:36:47.352
Oh, those little rats!

00:36:48.311 --> 00:36:49.312
Let's go!

00:36:58.613 --> 00:36:59.614
Follow the bike.

00:37:05.912 --> 00:37:07.997
Taejoong, where'd you go, asshole?

00:37:08.081 --> 00:37:10.625
Do Gangae, now's the time
to show me what you've got.

00:37:20.677 --> 00:37:21.678
[laughs]

00:37:22.929 --> 00:37:24.347
Now it's getting fun.

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:25.765
This is real Hollywood shit.

00:37:42.198 --> 00:37:43.324
[man] He's getting away.

00:37:43.408 --> 00:37:46.077
Number 9, you crazy motherfucker!
I fucking love you.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.370
Let's go!

00:37:56.379 --> 00:37:58.006
He's right there. Can you get him?

00:38:01.134 --> 00:38:03.177
He's way ahead of me. Fuck!

00:38:04.262 --> 00:38:05.889
You better catch him quickly.

00:38:21.112 --> 00:38:22.864
Those motherfuckers.

00:38:22.947 --> 00:38:24.699
Where did those assholes run off to?

00:38:25.658 --> 00:38:27.035
There's that bastard!

00:38:27.118 --> 00:38:28.745
I fucking got you now!

00:38:35.293 --> 00:38:36.336
You son of a bitch.

Oh, shit!

00:38:45.428 --> 00:38:48.222
-Is that a gun?
-Hold up. You let them have guns?

00:38:48.306 --> 00:38:50.892
Hell yeah! Get to see some people
shoot each other!

00:38:50.975 --> 00:38:52.352
This is bulletproof, right?

00:38:53.311 --> 00:38:54.979
What the fuck?

00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:03.446
I hate you, motherfucker.

00:39:12.747 --> 00:39:13.831
Aah!

00:39:34.602 --> 00:39:36.437

-Incredible!
-Yeah!

00:39:39.148 --> 00:39:42.068
This shit is so fucking fun.
This is gonna be a huge hit.

Fucking hell.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.463
Starting now, I'm changing the rules.

00:40:02.547 --> 00:40:05.633
The one who catches the motorbike
will be declared the winner.

00:40:05.717 --> 00:40:08.386
And if you're the one to catch him
dead or alive,

00:40:08.469 --> 00:40:11.014
I will double your prize money
for coming in first.

00:40:12.765 --> 00:40:14.517
10 billion?

00:40:15.685 --> 00:40:17.186
Where is he? Where's his bike?

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.188
I gotta find the motorbike right now.

00:40:19.272 --> 00:40:21.274
Park Taejoong is worth 10 billion?

00:40:23.401 --> 00:40:24.527
Motorbike! Motorbike!

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:26.863
Fuck. I'm really risking it all
for you bastards!

00:40:41.961 --> 00:40:43.296
Park Taejoong.

00:40:44.088 --> 00:40:46.424
Are you okay? Oh, you're hurt, aren't you?

00:40:46.507 --> 00:40:49.052
Huh? You okay? You okay? Are you?

Whoa! What was that? What are you doing?

00:43:03.561 --> 00:43:04.812
What is that for?

00:43:04.896 --> 00:43:06.147
Why do you have a gun?

00:43:06.856 --> 00:43:08.816
-Whoa! What the fuck?
-What are you doing?

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:09.901
Are you fucking crazy?

00:43:09.984 --> 00:43:11.986
Take the guests to a safe place.

00:43:16.365 --> 00:43:17.658
Where are we going?

00:43:20.536 --> 00:43:23.581
Sorry. Sorry. Okay, okay, okay, I'll go.

Move it! You're blocking the view.

[gunshot]

00:43:58.032 --> 00:43:59.325
What? Are you scared now?

00:43:59.408 --> 00:44:00.868
Are you freaking out?

00:44:00.952 --> 00:44:02.662
[laughing maniacally]

00:44:06.123 --> 00:44:07.500
You're running away now?

00:44:07.583 --> 00:44:08.876
Too bad.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.795
Try and hide. Go on.

00:44:15.758 --> 00:44:17.218

Where are you going?

Where are you?

00:45:13.607 --> 00:45:14.608
Oh, there he is!

After him, now!

00:46:06.535 --> 00:46:07.870
So...

00:46:08.954 --> 00:46:10.831
why did you request this meeting?

00:46:15.044 --> 00:46:16.629
I was just curious.

00:46:16.712 --> 00:46:18.839
Did you come up here all for this?
