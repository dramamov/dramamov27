Because I'm more powerful than you?

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.340
Because despite how dangerous you were,

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.920
Fang Zhou still chose to trust you,

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.970
passing the Heart-Moon Return to you,

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.610

What was I to him?

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.010
You were a good junior to him

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.240
and a bad senior to me.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:20.960
Actually,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.840
he knew I was hiding something.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.290
Yet he still chose to believe in me.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:32.750
But I

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.490

Hao Wenhou's fiancée?

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.030
I originally thought

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.420
you sent her to me.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.320
Why would I send someone

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.530
to you?

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.200
Then why did Fang Zhou trust me?

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.640
Because that's just how he was.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.440
He clearly knew

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.000
about your connection

with Yique Yinyang.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.020
Yet he still believed
he could guide you properly.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.700
Only he could do that.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.480
I couldn't.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:10.960
And you

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.510
couldn't either.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.670
Did he really love every single person

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.980
in this world that much?

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:16.750
He would

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.480
sacrifice himself for someone

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.080

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.200
How foolish.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.120
I think so too.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.630
I told him that.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.530
But he wouldn't listen.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.320
One time,

he brought an injured tiger
from the mountain

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.920
back to Zhoudi Tower for treatment.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.440
It scared away all the children

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.440
living in the peach blossom forest.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.300
Fu had to feed the tiger.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.460
When the tiger roared,

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.280
he was scared half to death.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.170
Any news about Fu?

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.620

whenever I arrive at a new place,

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.870

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.600
His body isn't inside.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:10.870
I know.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.870
Above this tomb,

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.170
I've set up a formation
of the Tianren Realm.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.510
Ordinary people can't see through it,

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.040
so it can protect Fang Zhou.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.840
If what you say is true,

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.680
I'll return the power
of the Rebirth Scroll

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.470
to you.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.490
This formation

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.750
changes with the flow of time.

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:42.400
Every day,

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.980
the hour

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.520
and direction

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.290
to open the formation change accordingly.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.420
Even on the same day,

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.490
the position
to open the formation differs.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.000
From the position
of the one opening the formation,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.510
the moon

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.790
must be

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.450
directly above the cenotaph.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.360
If you miss the time,

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:20.510
you cannot

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.260
open it again that day.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.910
Besides,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.390
opening the formation

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.850
also requires the power
of the bone-washing silver bracelet.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:16.900
Senior.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.110
I've made an agreement with Shui Duopo.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.200
As long as you return
the power of the Rebirth Scroll

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:38.880
to me,

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.710
she will extract from my abdomen

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.730
Fang Zhou's heart crystal

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.820
to help resurrect him.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.810
I want to see him again.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:54.640
May I?

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.510
Yes,

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.740
but not for too long.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.640
Yan.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.170
We need to seal the coffin now.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.070
I keep telling myself

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.240
not to be deceived by you.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.440
But I still can't help

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.170
believing you again and again.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.310
Now,

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.050
you're trying to fool me

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.080
with such a cheap trick,

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.000
and you still expect me to believe you?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.530
What are you talking about?

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.880
How could this be?

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200
How could this be?

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:43.550
It's impossible.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.610
How could this happen?

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.960
Where is Fang Zhou?

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.170
Where's Fang Zhou?

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.510
Tang Lici,

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.000
you're still acting even now!

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:05.920
How could this happen?

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.120
Where exactly is Fang Zhou?

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.140
Where is he?

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.160
Where exactly is he?

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.590
Fang Zhou's been dead for years!

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.400
He died at Zhoudi Tower four years ago!

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.800
His body was never found!

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.110
Tang Lici.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.720
Don't try to fool me again!

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.920
Liu Yan.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.000
Did you tell Ghostly Peony

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.880
about Fang Zhou?

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.210
Do you take me for a fool?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.510
I didn't tell anyone

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.440
about Fang Zhou!

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.830
So you do know him.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.880
Has Ghostly Peony

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.340
ever been to Zhoudi Tower?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.460
You just said it yourself.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.440
This is a formation of the Tianren Realm.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.350
Without the bone-washing silver bracelet,

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.350
no one can open it.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.270
He did come here,

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.870
but he couldn't do anything!

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.070
Ghostly Peony is Yique Yinyang!

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.440
Yeah.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.910
Ghostly Peony is Yique Yinyang.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.960
Why didn't I realize this sooner?

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.270
He's not merely the vessel

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.870
for Yique Yinyang's spirit.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.140
He's Yique Yinyang himself!

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:29.690
Otherwise…

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.010
how could he open the formation?

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.280
Impossible.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:40.580
Impossible.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:41.970
Impossible!

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:42.830
Shut up!

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:44.750
No, you shut up!

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.790
Liu Yan.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:53.590
Listen to me.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.550
Ghostly Peony has stolen

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.550
Fang Zhou's body.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.550
Let's join forces

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.240
to make him return

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.680
Fang Zhou's body.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.460
Tang Lici, you're really something.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.070
How can you tell one lie

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.240
after another?

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:12.640
Liu Yan!

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.400
Shut up!

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.110
Fine.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.200
You won't help me.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.050
Then I'll do it myself.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:23.750
Tell me.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.550
Where is Ghostly Peony?

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.600
After I kill you,

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.000
I'll send him to see you.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.200
Liu Yan.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.670
I'm asking you one more time.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.160
Where is

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.270
Ghostly Peony?

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.110
Yan!

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.720
Don't go!

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.590
Yan.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:04.550
Fang Zhou.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.120
Ghostly Peony.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.110
Ghostly Peony!

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.310
Tang Lici will definitely not let you go.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.550
The formation of the Tianren Realm

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.350
required the bone-washing silver bracelet
as the key.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.880
Fortunately, Qiaoyi Qiankun
made it in time.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.480
That was close,

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.080
wasn't it?

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.200
Fang Zhou's body is missing.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.000
Do you think

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.960
Tang Lici can still remain calm?

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.350
At least,

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:53.440
Liu Yan can't stay calm.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.640
Lies attract more lies.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.400
Around one lie,

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.110
there are at least four more.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.170
Fang Pingzhai's Inverted Dream.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.830
Fang Zhou's body at Zhoudi Tower.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.790
Around Tang Lici,

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.150
how many more lies are there?

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.920
Head Fang,

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.100
I can't persuade your disciple.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.920
I just hope
that when you learn your resurrection

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.880
was paid for

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.400
with your disciple's life,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.460
you won't blame me.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.480
Miss Shei.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.240
Senior.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.480
Mr. Tang has been gone for days.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.750
Do you know where he went?

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.280
He's not my responsibility.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.310
Besides,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.270
that fox

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:53.790
must be plotting something.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.510
He might be

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.310
stirring up trouble somewhere.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:57.920
You talk

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.390
just like Chi.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.110
Do I?

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.060
I told you he's cunning.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.750
This is

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.920
Head Fang's figurine?

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:14.480
You know it?

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.950
I've seen it before.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.750
Mr. Tang has been carving it recently.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:21.130
I didn't expect

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.050
he'd finish it so quickly.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.190
His face...

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:34.710
Shei.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.000
Brother.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.000
My sister Fang Ci

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.030
is now in your care.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.280
I must go to the mountain to learn skills

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.070
to fight against Yique Yinyang.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.600
I don't know if I'll survive.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.220
Her past name no longer matters.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.830
From now on, call her Shei.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.590
Father.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.410
Your brother's name is

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.160
Fang Zhou.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.830
He's been looking for you.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.680
Brother.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.680
It's me.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:08.480
Brother.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.270
Brother, where are you?

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.960
Brother!

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.110
He's Tang Lici.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.880
Do you want revenge?

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.710
With your memory intact,

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.390
you can't fool Tang Lici.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.160
Have you lost your memory before?

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:31.880
What?

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.590
I used the Xuluo needle

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.170
to pierce your Yuzhen acupoint.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.300
You had no reaction.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.550
This is a symptom of memory loss.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:43.650
Forget your brother.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:52.400
Miss Shei,

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.030
you confuse me.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.550
You're in this game,

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:57.350
yet you know

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.800
nothing about it.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.240
Miss Shei.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:08.150
Miss Shei, what's wrong?

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.200
Shei?

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.300
Fang Zhou is gone.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.520
He really died because of me.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.070
Fang Zhou is gone.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.620
He really died because of me.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:31.070
Master!

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:33.400
Master!

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.310
I need to complete the final refinement

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.970
of the Thousand Curse Needle.

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.720
Get out!

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.270
No.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.720
To refine the Thousand Curse Needle,

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.580
you must force it out
through the Tianmen acupoint.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.160
The pain will kill you.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.250
If Tang Lici isn't dead yet,

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.480
how can I die?

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.480
Master.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.510
Tang Lici

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.770
isn't worth you suffering like this.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.480
Master!

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.240
Don't tell me what to do!

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:58.880
Get out!

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.070
Master!

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:11.720
Master!

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.870
Open the door!

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.750
Master!

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.720
Master!

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.750
Tang Lici.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.830
I'll make you wish you were dead.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.350
I'll make you wish you were dead!

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.720
Mr. Tang,

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.160
reports from the front:

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.400
Xifang Tao has gathered troops
on the western front.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.550
Fucui is on the eastern side.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.920
It seems they plan

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.310
to strike from both sides

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.970
to attack the Sword Alliance.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.750
They're determined to fight

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.480
to the death with the Alliance.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.690
Master Shao,

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.930
any news of Ghostly Peony?

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:04.720
Not yet,

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.790
but Fengliu Shop has mobilized
all their forces this time.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.770
Ghostly Peony will certainly come.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:11.270
Tongsha River and Xiulao Peak

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.130
on the east and west of Mount Cloud

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.030
are crucial for gaining

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.090
the upper hand against the Alliance.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.400
Mr. Tang,

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.220
do you have a strategy?

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:39.890
At this moment,

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:42.640
neither side has fully recovered
its strength.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.400
Fengliu Shop has sent out all their forces

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.000
because they want a quick victory.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:49.030
With this battle,

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.110
they aim to determine the winner
between them and us.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.920
The Tongsha River
forms a natural barrier to the west.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.270
The banks on both sides are flat.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:56.720
Liu Yan will deploy
the Nine Qilin Transformations

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.400
there.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.110
We can position
our main forces along the river.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.160
Master Puzhu and I

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:03.750
will lead the Sword Alliance

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.440
and the Yanmen disciples to fight them.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.370
On the east side,

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.030
at Xiulao Peak,

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.720
we can take advantage of the mountain

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.960
and maintain a strong defense.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.690
Master Shao,

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:13.350
you and Master Cheng

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.310
should establish
a defensive line here together.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.910
Hold your ground without attacking.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.170
Once Master Puzhu and I

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.110
break through the western line together,

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.750
we'll move downstream along the river

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.080
and circle behind Fucui

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.680
to attack from both the front and back.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:26.720
Fengliu Shop

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.510
will be annihilated in this one battle.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.480
If Liu Yan makes a move…

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.990
Even if he doesn't come for me,

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.180
I'll go after him.

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.960
Master.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.280
All troops are in position.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.660
We await your command.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.400
Starting tomorrow,

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.640
gather all our forces

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.040
to completely destroy the Sword Alliance.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.040
Notify Qiaoyi Qiankun

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.560
to act as the vanguard

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.560
and break through the front line
at the Tongsha River.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.670
Qingchan,

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:02.960
you will assist Palace Chief Xifang.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.750
The battle at Tongsha River

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:04.640
can't be lost!

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:05.480
Yes, Master.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:07.200
Fucui,

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:08.830
I'm giving you the remaining

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:09.960
Blood Ghost Pills.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.310
Xiulao Peak's terrain is complex.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:12.910
You'll have to fight on foot.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.240
Bring Kuanglan Wuxing

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.550
with you.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:16.750
Yes.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:18.480
Then, Master,

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.790
which front will you lead?

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.750
Wherever Tang Lici is,

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.060
that's where I'll be.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:29.240
Set off now.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.440
Don't worry, Mr. Chi.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.020
With Yanmeng here,

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:43.440
they won't be able to cross

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.720
the Tongsha River.

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:47.200
Tongsha—

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.960
what a good name.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.590
Let's kill

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:52.450
every last one of them right here.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:57.930
Mr. Tang.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.300
Have you found Ghostly Peony yet?

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.230
Ten li southwest

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.270
lies Master Puzhu's unit.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.530
All of you stay here.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.719
I'll go to help them.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.280
Shen.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.320
Have you noticed that Foxy Tang has been

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.320
acting stranger and stranger lately?

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.120
I'll go check.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.070
Ants!

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.570
You're all just ants!

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.150
What kind of monster is that?

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:41.760
Nine Qilin Transformations!

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.440
Run!

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.190
Light Technique.

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.320
Unbreakable Snare!

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:12.590
Don't kill him!

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.130
Take him as a hostage.

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:06.100
Where is Ghostly Peony?

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.630
That's not something I should know.

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.380
Only one of you needs to live.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.840
Let's see which one that'll be.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:02.770
You're not escaping.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.020
Step aside!

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:08.210
Puzhu's wounded!

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.840
Not my problem.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.800
Tang Lici!

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.230
How could you lose

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.490
your usual composure?

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.260
That fire was poisonous.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.650
Return to camp and rest.

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.570
The fire poison is fierce.

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:46.030
Master Puzhu,

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.280
you must return to the Sword Alliance

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.280
and seek treatment from Shui Duopo.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.230
We're in the middle

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.550
of a decisive battle with Fengliu Shop.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:56.680
I can't retreat now.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:58.570
Going into battle wounded

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.430
will only aggravate the injury.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:02.960
Then, Mr. Tang,

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800
can you stay calm?

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.150
Why do you ask?

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.320
I've

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.280
never seen you

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.210
so angry before.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.640
I know what I'm doing.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.240
Xifang Tao, what are you doing here?

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.440
I'm just here to deliver medicine.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.480
Why don't you two believe me?

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:32.730
A cat delivering rice to a mouse—

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.660
who'd buy that?

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.510
How is Master Puzhu?

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.240
If you came to spy on our forces,

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.230
you'll have to leave some intel

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.440
before you go.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:46.430
This medicine

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.890
won't fully neutralize the fire poison,

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.920
but it can ease

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.520
Master Puzhu's pain for now.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:56.970
No one here believes that.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.190
I do.

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.840
Miss Tao,

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.960
did you bring this medicine

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.020
especially for me?

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:23.070
As you can see.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.150
May I leave now?

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.550
Since you're already here,

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.360
why leave?

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:33.920
Sir,

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:35.950
don't forget

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.160
that we stand on opposite sides.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:40.750
If that's the case,

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.110
why

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.880
save me at all?

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.890
I'm indebted to you.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.490
I wanted to offer myself to you,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.460
but I feared you'd refuse,

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.090
so all I could give was this antidote.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.390
They're...

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:57.670
Is your tongue broken?

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.710
There's nothing improper
between Master Puzhu and me.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:02.360
Besides,

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.590
he's the successor of Tianjing Pavilion—

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:07.640
he's as chaste as they come.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:14.230
Foxy Tang,

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:16.040
are you just letting her go?

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.280
If Ghostly Peony dies,

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:20.960
will you

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.510
be free again?

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:26.440
Where is

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.620
Ghostly Peony?

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.180
If you'd asked me earlier,

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.960
I'd have told you

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.160
he was at Plum Garden.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.440
But a few days ago,

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:37.670
he somehow

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:38.880
got hold of a coffin.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:41.480
A coffin?

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.440
He said he was going to

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.840
the Sky-Ascending Pillars in Puti Valley.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.880
The Sky-Ascending Pillars
built by Yique Yinyang?

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.400
I guess

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:49.920
he wants to place

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.500
that coffin there.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:53.440
Can we trust you?

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.860
You won't get more from me
even if you kill me.

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:59.590
At least we can't let you remain a threat.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:14.970
Mr. Tang,

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.590
isn't this repaying kindness with enmity?

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:20.250
Because of your sneak attack,

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.320
Master Puzhu was injured.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.400
You brought him medicine

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:26.360
because you owed him a favor.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:28.670
And this strike of mine

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.760
was for your ambush just now.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.050
For seven days,

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.520
you'll only have 30% of your power,

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.770
but it won't be life-threatening.

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:39.560
This settlement

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.660
is more than merciful.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:47.230
Mr. Tang, you're quite calculating.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.000
This is indeed fair.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:56.760
Master Puzhu,

00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.520
farewell.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.190
Why did she only say

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:11.120
farewell to you?

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.080
Master Puzhu,

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.090
your injuries are severe,

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.150
but if you return to the Sword Alliance,

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:35.510
Shui Duopo can heal you.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.470
You can return to battle
within seven days.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.400
That's faster than

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.630
Miss Xifang's

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.400
recovery time.

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.630
Also,

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.870
please notify Her Highness quickly

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:48.920
to send reinforcements to Tongsha River.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.510
Ideally,

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.320
General Yuchi

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.080
should personally command the troops.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.370
Alright.

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:04.550
I will return to the Alliance immediately.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:06.650
Thank you, Master Puzhu.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:15.710
Tang Lici.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.770
I have something to say.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:24.800
What happened?

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:26.840
The coffin

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:29.040
and your strange behavior.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:32.230
Fang Zhou…

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:35.000
is not dead.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.760
Fang Zhou isn't dead?

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:38.300
That's impossible.

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.000
Why is it impossible?

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:44.670
When Fang Zhou

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:46.440
had just a breath left,

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:49.550
I extracted his heart crystal
with my own hands

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:51.080
and buried it in my abdomen.

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:53.000
With my self-healing constitution,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.260
I've been nurturing this heart crystal,

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:56.550
cleansing the evil energy

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:58.280
left by Yique Yinyang.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.590
That's why

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:01.800
you've been having stomach pains.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.800
Does Liu Yan know?

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:09.330
He doesn't believe me.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.440
You're truly insane.
