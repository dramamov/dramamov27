00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.710
(Peace and Prosperity)
Come on.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.580
A hot spring villa?

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.300
Yes, it's near Fengling City.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.760
I've compared the portrait

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.760
you gave me.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.780
The follower...

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.220
Xue Hanmei.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.420
He's right there.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.550
There's no time to waste.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.860
Stop drinking; let's go.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.140
General Chu,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.770
the scout just reported

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.560
that the North Qi army
had suddenly gathered,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.890
heading towards the North Qi camp

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.630
near Fengling City.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.660
(Sui)

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.060
(Fengling City)

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.070
The North Qi army is here.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.630
Don't worry.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.060
The more they are, the better.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.470
My new octagonal crossbow

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.340
will surely wipe them out.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.380
I'm just afraid
they won't dare to fight.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.180
Pass the order down:

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.160
The crossbowmen are on standby.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.690
All soldiers,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.290
prepare for battle.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.810
Yes.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.850
Shoot!

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.010
- Retreat!
- Retreat!

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.460
Retreat!

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.730
What a pity.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.620
The manufacturing process

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.190
of the crossbow is too complicated,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.170
so it can only be equipped
for the crossbowmen.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.760
If every soldier defending the city

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.300
had one,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.500
we could easily flatten North Qi.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.120
North Qi's troops are on par with ours.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.900
Since they're already here,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.140
why are they avoiding battle?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.160
Yun, what happened after you sent

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.100
the vanguard today?

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.750
After a short fight,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.690
they didn't chase us.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.310
They surround

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.340
but do not attack.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.430
What is North Qi

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.820
really planning?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.630
Chusheng,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.920
anything from the interrogation

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.100
of Xu Lingzhang last night?

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.210
He claimed that North Qi

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.290
would send another 20,000 troops

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.850
to take Qingzhou.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.490
Another 20,000 troops?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.580
That's too absurd.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.610
Xu Lingzhang is cunning.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.370
We can't easily believe

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.660
what he says.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.120
Though we don't know North Qi's

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.060
true intentions,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.800
(Sui)
but their current actions

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.470
have shown that their real goal

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.820
is not to attack Qingzhou.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.930
What is this thing?

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.930
Report!

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.950
Report from the front line:

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.220
More North Qi troops are coming,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.070
and there are even

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.340
octagonal crossbow chariots.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.240
They have actually made

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.410
octagonal crossbow chariots?

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.590
It's not certain whether they were made

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.780
according to your mechanism.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.930
If North Qi has also produced

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.220
a genius of the ages...

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.370
Yu!

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.140
There's gunpowder, too.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.340
Chariots combined with gunpowder

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.620
are even more powerful.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.770
Chu Shan, pass the order:

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:29.890
Strengthen the defense.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.980
Yes.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.180
Linyang,

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.370
I'll guard here for you.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.860
Go and arrange the defense.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.180
Yu,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.420
be very careful.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.020
Crossbowmen, get ready.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.130
Yes.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.800
Be careful.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.800
Careful, careful.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.640
Slow down.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.540
Carry him back.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.240
Didn't I tell Chu Shan

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.440
to prepare a carriage for you

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.800
to send you back to Huajing City?

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.160
Why are you still here?

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.190
I won't go.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.130
I want to stay here.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.020
Haven't you seen
that the war has started?

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.700
As the general of Fengling,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.580
I won't have time to look after you.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.720
If you get hurt because of the war,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.340
how can I explain to your father?

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.120
Look at these soldiers here.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.170
I'm a physician.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.360
As long as I stay,

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.390
they have a better chance of survival.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.600
Do you want me to ignore them?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.600
I can't do that.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.460
Even if you send me
back to Huajing today,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.870
I will come again tomorrow.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:22.810
Qingping.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.940
I do like you,

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.610
but I'm staying today

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.040
for these soldiers

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.980
and the people.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.490
Everyone has been caring for me,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.730
hoping that I could live
a peaceful life.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.510
But now that Fengling is in danger,

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.100
how can I stand by and do nothing?

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.900
The woman standing in front of you

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.610
is not the daughter of the Duke of Hu,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.100
nor is she the Tuantuan
who needs protection.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.660
I am just a military physician.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.690
General Chu,

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.340
please respect my choice.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.490
Lend a hand.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.780
Come on.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.300
- Be careful.
- Hurry.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.720
Come on, this way.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.660
Coming.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.370
Protect yourself.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.170
No matter when,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.020
make sure you survive first.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.070
Gently, gently.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.010
Alright.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.660
I understand.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.140
Stop his bleeding.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.000
Stop his bleeding!

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.940
Coming.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.980
Charge!

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.320
Even if we create

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.340
more powerful weapons,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.120
we can't withstand this endless war.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.890
They just want to exhaust us.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.380
Then we'll hold on to the death.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.490
My father died for the country.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.010
I will carry on

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.610
my father's will,

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.300
guard the border

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.890
of Great Sui,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.610
and die if I have to.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.100
I'm willing to guard the city

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.520
with Linyang with my life.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.830
If the city stands, we live.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.060
If the city falls, we die.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.740
(Sui)

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.970
Listen up, Chu Army.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.770
We will never retreat!

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.610
Never retreat!

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.220
Never retreat!

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.770
Never retreat!

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.340
Never retreat!

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.770
Never retreat!

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.340
(Qingzhou Yamen)

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.490
The Yunyang Princess of North Qi

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.370
once plotted against the Lord of Qin

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.240
and caused us

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.540
to lose three cities.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.630
Now, she holds

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.080
considerable influence in North Qi.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.510
Even Su Can, King of North Qi,

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.610
is wary of her.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.180
It's hard to say

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.490
who planned all this

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:50.730
in North Qi.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.670
Yun,

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.790
how come you know so much

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.070
about the North Qi royal family?

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.360
Since they can plant spies

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.300
in Great Sui,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.480
we naturally need

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.490
a source of intelligence.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.160
When the former marquis was alive,

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.550
he had already planted

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.490
insiders in North Qi.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.220
What a far-reaching

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:09.450
vision.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.120
After we lost three cities,

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.060
Qingzhou and Fengling

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.540
became our border.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.580
(Qi)
Fengling is the hard target.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.130
Once it is breached,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.250
Huajing will be exposed.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.670
North Qi has gathered

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.610
a large army in Qingzhou

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.890
without attacking.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:27.700
What is their real purpose?

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.970
Their target

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.850
might not be us.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.460
You mean

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.970
they are stationed in Qingzhou

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.440
and actually targeting Fengling?

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.210
Report.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.340
Fengling was raided by North Qi.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.450
It's in great danger.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.240
North Qi has sent a large army

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.220
to Qingzhou

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.240
to prevent us

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.300
from supporting Fengling.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.150
We can send part of our troops

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.270
- to Fengling.
- No.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.460
If we reduce our forces,

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.360
the North Qi army outside

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.460
will attack us,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.840
leaving both cities

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.720
unable to cope.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.660
Ultimately,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.300
we'll suffer a total defeat.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.940
What a vicious plan.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.330
(Yu.)

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.970
Send an urgent war report

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.270
to the court immediately,

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.820
informing them of the situation,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.850
and requesting reinforcements
for Fengling.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.420
Yes.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.600
When General Chu

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.720
was guarding the city,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.840
the court was

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.730
too complicated,

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:29.970
and no reinforcements were sent.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.300
Wei Yun,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.940
there are too many voices in the court.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.390
It'll affect the Emperor's judgment.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.330
But we have to do this.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:38.550
The Emperor must know

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.800
the situation of the two cities.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.380
Even if the message reaches the Palace,

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.360
the reinforcements

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.700
may not be able to arrive in time.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.340
Will it be too late?

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.060
Fengling can't wait.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.600
Come on.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.030
Is there anything we can do?

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.910
We can't just stand by

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.100
and watch Fengling fall.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.540
Come on.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.580
With the North Qi's main force outside,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.340
there must be an opportunity within.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.940
They're using a diversionary tactic;

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.820
I will attack their weak spot.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.900
Everyone,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.750
I need you to help me hold on

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:14.700
for four days.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.580
I'm going to fight

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.490
for a glimmer of hope for Great Sui.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.660
Wenchang,

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.250
you look the most like me.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.060
Pretend to be me and patrol daily.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.850
Do not let North Qi find out.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.460
The weather is dry.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.180
Be careful with fire.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.610
Since you've made this risky decision,

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.180
you must've had

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.060
an infallible plan,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.300
right?

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.440
The one who understands you the most

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.380
is your opponent.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.370
You're indeed meticulous.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.600
General Wei,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.930
in matters concerning Great Sui,

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.390
you would not make

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:38.700
any hasty decisions.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.360
So,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.200
apart from having us

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.340
delay for you,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.370
what is your plan?

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.300
Assassinate Su Can, King of North Qi.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.300
Kill Su Can in four days?

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.340
Why are you so confident?

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.940
That insider

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.060
is my last resort.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.300
Even if I fail,

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.720
there is still one last person

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.820
to complete this mission.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.830
Even if it means mutual destruction,

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.610
I will kill Su Can.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.060
Then I will do everything I can

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.220
to delay for you.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.060
To you.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.580
(Yu,)

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.020
(please hold on.)

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:31.780
Ms. Chu Jin, please enjoy.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.480
My Lady,

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.750
you haven't had a proper meal

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.890
for several days in a row.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.980
Please eat something.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.020
Quan,

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.350
how are Linyang and Yu doing

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.060
in Fengling?

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.100
What's happening in Qingzhou?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.540
If you're so worried about Mr. Song,

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.440
why not write a letter

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.380
to Qingzhou?

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.260
I have my principles.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.160
I will not change

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.100
for anyone.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.690
But I'll also face my feelings.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.280
Three times is the limit.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.030
If I think of him

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.340
for the third time,

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.060
I will definitely go to him.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.700
(Chu Mansion)

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.660
My Lady,

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.170
you can't climb up.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.270
Why don't we

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.640
just sneak out

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.820
through the main gate?

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.670
If we go out through the main gate,

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.580
Mother will find out.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.740
Chu Yu can climb over the wall

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.620
so easily every time.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.680
Why can't I?

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.790
I am also a Chu.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.000
I can do it, too.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.060
My Lady,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.610
are you really going?

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.300
If Madam Chu finds out,

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.110
we will never be able

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.200
to enter this house again.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.440
Stop talking nonsense.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.540
Hurry up and give me a hand.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.160
My Lady,

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.100
I can't hold on any longer.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.140
My Lady.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.180
You scared me.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.380
Wanyue,

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.620
what are you doing here?

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.890
I knew it.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.830
The one who can't climb over the wall

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.410
is indeed you.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.510
What are you doing here,

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.890
sneaking around

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.120
in the middle of the night?

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.780
Don't wake my mother up.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.340
Wanyue,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.830
don't you want to go to Fengling

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:22.930
to see my sister?

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.000
But Ms. Chu asked me to stay

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.200
and protect you and Madam Chu.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:28.240
What?

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.780
Are you also going to Fengling?

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.070
Why am I going to Fengling?

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.060
I'm going to Qingzhou.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.680
I don't have

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.610
to prove myself under their nose.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.450
My Lady,

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.170
do you want to prove yourself,

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.170
or do you want to see Mr. Song?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.030
Listen.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.260
I overheard it today.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.550
Qingzhou is now surrounded

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.120
by tens of thousands of North Qi troops.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:49.930
It's very dangerous.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.120
I just can't sit still.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.500
No matter what,

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.370
I have to see it with my own eyes.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.300
I'll help in any way I can.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.780
I don't want to be useless

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.060
and always protected by everyone.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.720
- Let's go.
- I won't go back.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.020
I'll take you there.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.120
You can't even climb over the wall.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.470
Do you really think you can get

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.460
to Qingzhou by yourself?

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.820
(Qingzhou)

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:34.370
(Qi)
General Wei must've arrived

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.890
(Qizhou)
in North Qi.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.490
The mission is arduous,

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.890
and there are only four days.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.510
Chusheng,

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.450
in your opinion,

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.550
what are the chances of success?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.130
Wei Yun told me before he left

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.170
that he'd guard Qingzhou.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.270
Since he is willing to risk his life

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.850
to assassinate Su Can,

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.000
I must

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.940
buy him some time

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.240
and hold Qingzhou for him.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:57.690
You're right.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.740
We should trust General Wei.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.050
I'm so thirsty.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.450
Get me a glass of water.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.080
Only when I'm pretending to be Yun

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:13.820
have I realized

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.830
that military affairs

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.820
are so complicated.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.260
There are so many tricks in patrolling.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.650
I've oversimplified

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.020
the battlefield.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:22.880
Wenchang,

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.160
your imitation of General Wei

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.300
is so lifelike.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.030
Shen You was once a spy.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.640
He's so good at observing details,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.680
yet he hasn't found out.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.780
Yun has gone to North Qi

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.580
on such a dangerous mission.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.720
He entrusted me

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.860
with such an important task.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.060
I must not let him down.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.890
We must be careful these days.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:40.610
If Shen You finds out

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.260
that Wei Yun is not in the city,

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.060
it might reveal his whereabouts.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.530
Then,

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.130
Qingzhou will be in danger;

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.550
Wei Yun will also be obstructed
in North Qi.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.140
Don't worry.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.510
I know.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.510
My task this time

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.880
is to hold on until Yun comes back.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.610
I won't be careless.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.010
I'm off

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.340
to continue the patrol.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.380
Wenchang used

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.690
to be idle all the time.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.300
Now that he's found something
he wants to do,

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.820
he's changed quite a bit.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.660
(Sui, Qingzhou)

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.500
(Qizhou, North Qi)

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.940
(Qi)

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.300
(Qi)

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.350
Your Majesty.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.290
Your Highness.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.030
Someone from Great Sui

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:58.910
has the audacity

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.790
(City Lord of Yun, Gongsun Lan)
to lead a troop

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.820
deep into the heart of North Qi.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.060
Did you see clearly?

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.690
Are they really from Great Sui?

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.450
Why would they come here?

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:08.980
I'm absolutely certain.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.500
My intelligence is never wrong.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.630
Is he really going

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.880
(Su Can, King of North Qi)
to attack our royal court?

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.900
Pass the order down.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.140
Wait.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.340
Your Majesty, don't rush.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.890
(Yunyang, Eldest Princess of North Qi)

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.270
We only know

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.740
that they are from Great Sui,

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.790
but we don't know

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:26.170
who is leading the troops.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.890
Even if someone has come secretly,

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.130
they are just minor soldiers,

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.980
nothing to be afraid of.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.620
Aunt,

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.120
you started the war at Fengling;

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.780
I'm pinning Qingzhou down.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.310
There are no spare soldiers

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.440
left in the royal court now.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:41.780
Isn't that dangerous?

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.160
The diversionary tactic

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.540
we conspired

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.240
is to take Great Sui

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.450
in one fell swoop.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.060
If Qingzhou withdraws its troops

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.820
and Wei Yun rushes to Fengling,

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.890
wouldn't our plan be ruined

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.070
at the last moment?

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.540
We might be taken by Great Sui

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.930
before we succeed.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:01.690
I want to recall half of the troops
from Qingzhou.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.650
(With me here,)

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.410
(no one can step into Fengling.)

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.140
General Chu,

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.780
North Qi keeps sending

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.030
soldiers and war chariots

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.400
in return.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.440
If this continues,

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.690
we will be exhausted.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.620
Hold our ground!

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.620
Be careful!

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.010
General Chu!

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:35.490
Linyang.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.890
Chu Shan, retreat the army.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.140
- Yes.
- Let's go.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.020
Everyone, retreat!

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.900
(General's Mansion)

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.820
Don't worry. I'm fine.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:13.690
Chu Shan,

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:15.780
no need to feel guilty.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.780
You've followed me for years.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.690
You're like my brother.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.450
If losing a leg could save your life,

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:25.370
it'd be worth it.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.820
Go and guard the city gates.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.780
Don't mope around here.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.940
Yes, General.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.860
(Peace and Prosperity)

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.180
It's okay.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.620
I've seen it clearly.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.610
Their mechanism
is still the original one,

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.110
so it will break down

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.060
in a few days.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.500
But the power of that war chariot

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.980
is just too strong.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.260
If we can't deal with them,

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:02.690
we have no chance

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.300
of winning this battle.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.240
Here's what I'm thinking.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.690
Such a large war chariot

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.690
is not easy to move around,

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.580
and it breaks down so frequently,

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.310
but there are always new war chariots

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.850
being sent to the front line.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.240
What does this mean?

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.640
The place to make the war chariots

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.020
must be near Fengling.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.100
That makes sense.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.400
I smelled a strong sulfur odor

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.020
on that war chariot.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.510
The same smell

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.060
is also on the arrows.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.130
The hot spring water contains sulfur.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.690
The hot spring villa.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.300
You mentioned it before.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.300
There must be a problem there.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.200
Linyang,

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.260
I'll take care of this.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:49.730
Yu,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.020
it's too dangerous for you

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.300
to go there rashly.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.690
Don't worry.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:58.210
I'm going there

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.850
to find a way out for everyone.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:10.020
Mother gave me this talisman

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.500
before I left.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.850
Keep it safe for me

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.610
before I come back.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.300
Guard Fengling as well.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.250
I'm off.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.850
Chu Yu,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.550
don't forget

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.500
the Eldest Princess.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.250
Don't worry.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:44.440
I will bring

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.700
the Eldest Princess back safely.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.180
Let's go.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:08.180
(Safe)

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:19.860
(Qingzhou City)

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.540
Why did the North Qi army

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:33.440
suddenly get so close?

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.540
Why are they suddenly here?

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.640
Is it a night raid?

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.740
(Qingzhou City)

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.370
Why did they suddenly get so close?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.930
General Wei is truly remarkable.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.480
Fengling is in a state of emergency,

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.740
yet you remain so calm.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.350
I've heard

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.820
that the Chu siblings

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.820
are currently in Fengling.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.640
Why is Shen You

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.980
suddenly making a fuss?

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.450
Does he want to provoke me?

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.140
No way.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:24.450
Song Wenchang,

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.370
you must remain calm.

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:27.820
I can't show any flaw.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:33.780
Deputy Shen,

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.350
they don't take you seriously

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:36.340
at all.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.680
There have been rumors

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.850
about Chu Yu and Wei Yun

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.540
in Huajing City.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.540
With Fengling in a critical situation,

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.340
he remains so calm and composed.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.060
In just a few days,

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.110
Wei Yun,

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.930
your skills have become worse.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.850
What do you mean?

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.340
I've fought with Wei Yun multiple times.

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.410
This man's abilities

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:19.740
are definitely not his.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.210
It's not Wei Yun?

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:23.440
As the main general,

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.540
Wei Yun is not in the city.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.450
Qingzhou is now leaderless.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.500
If we launch an attack now,

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.850
taking Qingzhou will be as easy as pie.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.210
Regardless of where Wei Yun is,

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.270
once the battle starts in Qingzhou,

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.740
he will be pinned down.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:39.490
Commander Gao,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.720
this is a once-in-a-lifetime

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.660
opportunity.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.820
Very well.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.170
Pass my order.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.580
Everyone, get ready.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.370
Prepare to attack the city.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.450
Yes.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:56.940
Wenchang,

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.010
are you hurt?

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.140
Shilan,

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.690
did I mess up?

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.580
It's okay.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.690
It was sudden.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.970
No one expected Shen You

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.110
to suddenly shoot an arrow.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.400
I must have messed up.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.410
Put yourself together.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.500
No one will blame you.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.740
(Sui)

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:01.970
Shilan,

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.610
North Qi is attacking.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:06.690
Respond.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.900
Hurry.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.180
Run!

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.660
Run!

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:51.770
Sweetie.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.200
I've finally found you.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.140
Let's go.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:56.730
Honey,

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.020
come in!

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.210
Hurry.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.580
(Qingzhou City)

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.260
Wenchang,

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:15.090
come with me to fight.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.360
There's no time to comfort you now.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.800
If you want others to respect you,

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.210
come with me to the battlefield.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:10.260
(Qingzhou City)

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.030
A bunch of inexperienced kids,

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:17.170
overestimating themselves.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.090
Everyone,

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.500
there are no generals in the city,

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.380
just nobodies giving orders.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.150
Let's take Qingzhou.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.100
Charge!

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.500
(Qingzhou City)

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:28.280
Escort the elderly, women,

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.490
and children out of the city.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.440
Leave some soldiers

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.380
to fight with me.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.280
But you're a civil official.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.380
I'm still an official.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.960
Escort as many

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.060
as you can.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.300
Go!

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.700
Let's go.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.610
Even with one breath left,

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.500
we'll guard Qingzhou.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:29.500
(Sui)

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.700
(Sui)

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.580
(As a civil official,)

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.690
(I regret I don't know how to fight.)

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.700
(Wei Yun,)

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.840
(you once said you never thought)

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.020
(I was a good person,)

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.650
(but you protected me)

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.650
(for Great Sui.)

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.380
(Today, I will also pin down)

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.100
(the North Qi army)

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.250
(and buy time for you for Great Sui.)
