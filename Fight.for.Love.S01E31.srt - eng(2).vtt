We are

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.600
like a pair of fellow sufferers.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.240
I'm not

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.510
your fellow.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.270
But I am.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.960
How is it?

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.720
I'm your good fellow, right?

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.070
If it weren't for my quick eyes

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.120
and agile hands,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.630
you wouldn't have gotten back

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.040
your spear.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.610
Look at what I've gone through

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.390
on this trip.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.120
This is not just a workshop;

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.680
it's an underground city.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.480
It's as big as twice my bureau.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.760
The war chariot

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.270
was hoisted by a zip line.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.800
Come on.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.310
There was only

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.430
a one-way channel.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.630
I ran around to lay the fuses

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.070
and set the explosives.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.270
I was exhausted.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.110
My hand

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.600
was even cramping.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.560
I've done so much.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.870
It's okay for me to call you Wei

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.150
from now on, right?

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.000
Lu Qiba.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.800
Chu Yu, look at him.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.740
He'll hit me even now.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.790
Thank you.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.030
Lu Qiba,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.640
thank you.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.480
You two...

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.200
I'm your good fellow, after all.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.600
Don't laugh at me,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.390
but when I first saw the war chariots

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.870
in the workshop,

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.730
my self-esteem was almost gone.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.490
I didn't expect
that they sacrificed so many lives

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.930
to test the octagonal crossbow.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.560
For a weapon,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.190
they'd stop at nothing.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.950
They completely disregard

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.170
the lives of their own people.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.480
It's too cruel.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.920
If the premise of winning a battle

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.800
is like this,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.390
I'd rather never be able to make

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.050
a war chariot in my whole life.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.760
Lu Qiba,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.880
everyone

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.240
has principles to uphold.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.840
You are right.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.000
Otherwise,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.360
why would North Qi have used

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.370
your discarded mechanism

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.920
on the battlefield in another form?

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.310
But they are doomed to fail.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:53.790
Alright.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.120
Time to go back to Fengling.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.120
The Chu troops resting here,

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.630
Father,

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.000
I will carry on your will

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.600
and never retreat,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.240
even at the cost of my life.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.630
Kill!

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:26.750
Kill! Kill! Kill!

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.600
Kill! Kill! Kill!

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.120
I'm here!

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.390
Don't even think about
taking one step forward.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.600
I have fought for years.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.320
My life long dedicated to the nation.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.550
Even if I die in battle,

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.200
I must dedicate myself

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.960
to heaven and earth,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.480
and to guard the nation's gate!

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.620
(Sui)

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.990
The reinforcements are here.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.000
The reinforcements
sent by the court are here!

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.300
(Sui)

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.040
Linyang!

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.110
Linyang!

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.350
Linyang.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.320
We made it.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.670
North Qi has retreated.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.750
We have held Fengling City.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.150
Linyang!

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.470
Linyang,

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.270
I'm back.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.440
General Chu, rest easy.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:51.870
Young Marquis Wei killed Su Can;

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.670
Chu Yu and I destroyed

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.360
the underground crossbow workshop.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.610
Qingzhou and Fengling are safe now.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.840
We have won

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.080
this battle.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.150
- Linyang?
- General Chu?

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.080
Linyang!

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.020
Linyang!

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:16.390
Linyang!

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.120
Linyang?

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.900
(General's Mansion)

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.840
I thought

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.870
I'd never see you again.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.550
Linyang,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.150
you should rest now.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.200
Tuantuan,

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:52.720
when will my body

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.840
be able to recover?

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.510
You risked your life

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.200
to destroy the war chariot.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.890
The fact that you came back alive

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.000
is already the best outcome.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.750
As for your leg...

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:29.840
Is there nothing you can do?

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.750
I have accomplished

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.180
everything I've ever sought.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.750
I asked for Fengling to be safe,

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.080
for Great Sui to be peaceful,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.270
and for the octagonal crossbow,

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:58.320
which devastated my family,

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.750
to disappear from the world.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.280
All causes and effects have dissipated.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.840
I have no regrets now.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.600
All of this is thanks to you.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.630
Thank you,

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.990
Tuantuan.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.000
You are a good physician.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.670
Am I just

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.320
a good physician to you?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.840
Tuantuan,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.670
not everything in this world

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.320
has to end

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.360
with being together.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.360
Is that your answer?

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.120
I never lie.

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:08.680
Since the day we met,

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:10.240
you've always been hesitant.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.680
But I believed you had feelings for me,

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.240
so I confessed my feelings

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.720
and followed you to Fengling.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.800
I...

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.720
I've done my best,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.750
and I've gotten my answer.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.960
I won't bother you anymore.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.350
General Chu, you should rest well.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:08.670
Tuantuan,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.200
I was a man with a death wish,

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.510
never expecting to survive.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:18.720
Meeting you...

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.270
You are the best physician for me.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.350
How is General Chu now?

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.950
He's fine.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.400
Tuantuan has checked for him.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:53.680
His leg injury

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.880
won't heal in a short time,

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.390
but fortunately,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.310
his life is not in danger.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.930
That's a stroke of luck in misfortune.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.080
Yu,

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.200
the worst is over.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.240
Things will get better.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.540
I wonder how the Eldest Princess

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:18.830
is doing in North Qi.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:20.920
I've sent people to inquire.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.030
We should get the news soon.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.000
North Qi has been defeated.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.800
Zhao Yue's foundation is unstable

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.310
and will need time to recuperate.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.590
The Eldest Princess

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:40.550
is his leverage against Great Sui.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.390
So, don't worry.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.270
However bold he is,

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.350
he won't dare to neglect her.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.340
Another piece of good news.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.840
Su Can's death

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.440
has eased the crisis in Qingzhou.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.590
(Su Can's death caused chaos)

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.100
(among the North Qi troops.)
They have

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.020
(We've reclaimed Qingzhou.)
reclaimed Qingzhou.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.400
(From Gu Chusheng)

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.960
To gain an advantage,

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.640
he went for the worst.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.790
That's his style.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.960
What's wrong?

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.000
Are you jealous again?

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.890
I don't like you mentioning him.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.240
You brought him up first.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.280
How can you blame me?

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.980
You can't act like you know him

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.000
so well.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.440
I don't want to see that.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.510
You're the Marquis of Zhenguo,

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.980
yet you're still like a young boy
when you're jealous.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.200
That's because you said...

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.920
You said that you'd choose

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.760
neither of us.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.440
Don't worry.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.790
No matter what,

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:19.830
I can't upset you,

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.350
right?

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.480
Look at the state you're in.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.370
If people see you, it'll be a joke.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.320
Alright.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.310
I like you, I like you.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.150
I like you the most.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.110
Is that enough?

(General's Mansion)

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:51.730
I just bought the pastries.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.160
They're freshly made; have a taste.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.000
Okay.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.870
- Have one.
- Let's eat together.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.080

Linyang, Yu,

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.160
cover for me later, okay?

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.170
You're the one

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.610
who insisted on coming back with us.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.960
Where's that courage

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.000
to sneak to Qingzhou now?

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.000
You're scared now?

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.350
Linyang, help me later, okay?

00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.630
Don't help her.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.280
You're back.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.750
- Mother.
- Mother.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.590
We're back.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.200
Mother, our heroes,

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.750
who have won the battle, are back.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:13.790

You're all here.

You're all here...

Linyang,

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.110
what happened to your leg?

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.270
Mother,

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.110
don't worry.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.510
My leg can be healed.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.000
Don't be sad.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.350
We're already lucky

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:41.400
to come back alive.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.240
- That's right.
- Linyang is right.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.080
We're already lucky

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.060
to come back alive.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.240
You're back, huh?

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:49.980
Will you run away again?

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:51.270
Will you do it again?

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.250
Mother, I'm wrong. Sorry.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.240
Will you run away again?

Mother, I'm wrong.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:55.070
Mother, I'm wrong.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.960
Will you do it again?

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.960
Yu, save me!

Yu!

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.280
You ran, huh?

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.250
- Yu, help!
- How dare you?

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.450

- Mother.

Good.

It's good that you're back.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.720
It's good that you're back.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.030

Heaven has blessed Great Sui.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.200
This great victory has brought

such honor and pride to Great Sui.

Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:48.440
Marquis of Zhenguo,

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.160
you beheaded the King
of Northern Qi, Su Can,

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:52.680
and deserve the foremost merit.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.210
Wenchang, Shilan.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:55.440
You two have also

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.110
impressed me greatly.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.440
Before, your father

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.650
forbade you from going to war.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.310
We underestimated your talents.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:02.590
Your Majesty,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.310
Supervisor Gu lost Qingzhou,

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.450
and surrendered to Northern Qi.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.960
This is a fact known to all.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.240
Therefore, I believe

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.550
he should not only not receive rewards,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
but should be charged with a crime.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.160
Marquis of Zhenguo,

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.720
what is your opinion?

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:24.350
Your Majesty,

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.480
Supervisor Gu feigned surrender

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.350
to buy time for me

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.920
to kill Su Can,

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.020
thus relieving the crisis
in Qingzhou and Fengling.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.720
Had he failed,

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.130
we'd also have been guilty
beyond pardon.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.310
Duke of Ning,

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.400
should we all be punished as well?

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.800
This...

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.510
With his body,

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.000
Supervisor Gu held Qingzhou

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.240
and protected

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.640
the people within the city.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.550
I am a Wei.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.450
I despise traitors the most.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.720
If Supervisor Gu had truly betrayed us,

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:07.400
I'd never have allowed him

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.540
to return to Huajing alive.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:10.390
Your Majesty,

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.240
without Supervisor Gu's sacrifice

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.180
and cooperation with us,

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.840
it'd be hard for us to reclaim Qingzhou.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.910
Indeed, Your Majesty.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.000
Supervisor Gu

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.000
helped us protect

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:18.940
the people of Qingzhou.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.720
I once heard that Supervisor Gu

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.590
and the Marquis of Zhenguo

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:23.510
were at odds,

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.170
but it seems now

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.120
that civil and military officials
are united.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.720
Very good.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.080
Very good.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:31.630
Gu Chusheng,

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.920
your achievements are remarkable.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.880
You are hereby promoted
to Minister of Personnel.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.050
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.590
Your Majesty,

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:49.070
there was another person

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.090
who contributed to Fengling's victory.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.200
Chu Yu, daughter
of the General of the Northwest,

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.600
infiltrated the hot spring villa,

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.610
risked her life to destroy
the crossbow workshop,

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.000
and brought peace to Fengling.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.240
Do you wish

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.960
to request a reward for Chu Yu?

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.280
Your Majesty,

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.400
I do wish to speak...

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.070
General Chu Jianchang's daughter...

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.280
I know her.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.160
She is also your sister-in-law.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.640
Let me think

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.750
about how to reward a woman

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.510
who has slain enemies
on the battlefield.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.110
By the way,

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.200
Duke of Ning, anything to report?

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.240
Your Majesty,

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.640
though the war
between our two nations has eased,

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.440
true peace has yet to come.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.880
We should send envoys soon
to pursue peace talks,

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.550
so that Great Sui

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.160
may enjoy lasting stability.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.480
I shall think

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.400
on this as well.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.840
Your Lordship,

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.750
the Emperor invites you
to join him for lunch.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.950
Sure.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.420
Thank you, Eunuch Huang.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.080
Wei Yun,

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.320
here's a reminder.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.350
You just now referred to her

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.430
not as Mrs. Wei,

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.830
but as Ms. Chu.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.350
I fear the Emperor

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.830
does not favor such

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:22.830
self-serving wording.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.240
You're quite good

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.550
at reading imperial intent, Minister Gu.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.000
But why stay behind

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.880
just to warn me?

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.440
Perhaps you're also serving yourself.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.960
My warning this time

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.240
is sincere.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.340
It's to thank you

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.410
for defending me just now.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.030
I only did so for the sake of Great Sui.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.960
I don't usually

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.240
serve myself.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:09.390
Young Marquis,

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:10.930
didn't you plan to use your merit

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.270
to win a chance

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.400
to be with Ms. Chu?

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.920
Did the Emperor refuse you?

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:17.270
It's worse.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.340
He didn't even let me ask for it.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.400
You don't want money

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:23.960
nor rank, or title.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:25.960
Shouldn't that please

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.800
the Emperor?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.480
I know you have a pure heart,

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.830
hoping that all who toil

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:37.750
will receive their due.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.030
But our nation

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.270
truly needs a sage.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.320
Your Majesty,

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.030
I do not understand

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.480
what you are trying to say.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.240
In this turbulent world,

00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.920
he needs to convince everyone

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:01.440
that his existence

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.350
will bring victory every time.

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:05.350
Before the people,

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.030
he may speak of justice,

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:08.640
law, and the people,

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.510
but the only thing

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.160
he cannot speak of

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.240
is his own desire.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:18.960
The realm,

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:20.310
the peace of the land,

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.030
and the people.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:23.200
Each of these

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.310
must weigh more
than the woman by his side.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:29.750
Great Sui has finally

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:30.750
won a victory.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.590
The Emperor must've made a decision.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.720
But when it falls upon me,

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:38.240
it's not so easy to accept.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.110
All sages have always been lonely.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:48.870
Could it be

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.720
that the Emperor wants you

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.660
to live alone forever?

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.150
Wei Qiu, you...

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.720
You'd better start

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.560
reading more books.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.270
I want one.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.070
Sir, me, too.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:07.640
- I'll take two!
- I was here first!

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.720
Sir, I want one!

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.560
Give me one!

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.200
Give me one!

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.620
You'll all get one. Help yourselves.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.310
Sir, sir.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:13.640
You'll all get one.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.440
I want this one!

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.000
- Here's the money.
- Take it yourself.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.200
What's plastered all over the streets?

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.600
The Marquis of Zhenguo slays Su Can!

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.340
It wards off evil!

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.080
Come and buy one!

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:22.960
You'll all get one!

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.800
Plenty for everyone!

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.510
This one's mine!

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:27.030
Come on, take one yourself!

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.310
How ridiculous.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.030
Indeed.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.350
How ridiculous.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.000
Your Majesty, how did you know

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.590
what the Marquis of Zhenguo wanted?

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.110
How could I not know

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.240
about Ms. Chu and him?

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.800
I am already old,

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.320
and it's time for me to think

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.160
about Huan's future.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:18.000
Huan must have

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.880
both reliable allies

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:25.150
and loyal followers.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:26.880
For the realm to remain stable,

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.920
some must cast aside

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.960
their personal desires.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.840
Wei Yun

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.110
cannot merely be Wei Yun

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.840
nor

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.760
just the Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.480
Your Majesty,

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.790
since you have such expectations

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:47.910
of the Marquis of Zhenguo,

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:49.480
does that mean you already have

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:50.710
a plan against North Qi?

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.070
Changming is still in North Qi.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.360
This matter

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:00.440
must be carefully considered.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.070
In diplomacy,

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.590
we must pursue peace talks
with North Qi.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.200
In military affairs,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.550
we must establish

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.290
a war god so fearsome

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.150
that North Qi will tremble at his name.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.510
No wonder you chose
the Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.670
He did kill the King of North Qi

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.230
and rescued Great Sui

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.760
from peril.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.550
Yet such a man,

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.880
entangled in love,

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.000
will surely have a weakness.

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.670
A portrait of the Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.350
- The Marquis's portrait.
- Give me one.

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:37.540
- Give me one!
- Me, too!

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:38.880
You're never late.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.550
What happened today?

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.930
The Marquis secured the northern border,

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.570
killed Su Can,

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:44.790
and brought peace to Qingzhou.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.920
They're glorious feats,

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.860
yet to you young ladies,

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:47.670
all you see

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:48.800
is romance and passion.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.360
Ten copies of The General in White!

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:52.710
Sure, we have them.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.320
What about the Marquis's portraits?

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.230
We've got plenty.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:56.480
On my way here,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.190
I saw the same scene.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.670
Young Marquis Wei risked his life

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.080
to kill the King of North Qi.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.070
Such a feat is indeed legendary.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:06.960
That it's taken Huajing by storm

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.800
is hardly surprising.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.840
Still,

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.480
the fervor seems a bit too much.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.110
Huajing is the capital.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:13.900
For such a great stir to rise,

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.320
someone must be fanning the flames

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.160
behind the scenes.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:17.910
It seems the Emperor is determined

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:18.910
to make Wei Yun

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.800
the pillar that steadies Great Sui.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.190
(Teahouse)
The Marquis's portraits

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.150
are sold out,

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.510
but I still have portraits

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:26.550
of the Left General

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.880
and the Right General.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.840
Who wants their portraits?

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.390
You should've said so earlier.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:33.070
I chased all the way here for nothing.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.710
I don't want their portraits.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.550
I only want the Marquis's portrait.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.400
- Exactly.
- Yes.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.610
I want the Marquis's portrait.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.640
Don't go!

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:41.760
Don't go!

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.600
Let's go.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:44.710
Let's check another vendor.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.360
Come on.

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.160
(Song Generals, Wenchang, Shilan)
Paintings!

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:49.840
Take a look at the paintings!

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.000
Brave generals are few in Great Sui.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.760
Shilan,

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.200
your performance

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.400
in the battle of Qingzhou

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.240
was outstanding.

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.320
Your future will surely be bright.

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:02.480
Chusheng, are you advising me

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:04.440
not to care about short-term gains
and losses?

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.030
I was able to go to Qingzhou

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.170
thanks to Young Marquis Wei's
recommendation.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.800
It let me fulfill my ambition.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.400
So, rest assured.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.400
I bear no resentment.

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:17.510
Instead, I truly admire

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:18.710
Young Marquis Wei's courage.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.800
Besides, it seems

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.160
that you

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.360
and Young Marquis Wei

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.230
have eased your tensions quite a bit.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:28.710
The prosperity of Great Sui

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.400
cannot rely on one man alone.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.210
As long as we stay united,

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:34.800
we will achieve great things.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.230
I've always known

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:37.150
that truth.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:39.950
Here.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:45.580
(Teahouse)

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.540
(True Might)

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.760
You're back.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:53.550
Chun.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.920
It's quite lifelike.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:07.480
I'm going.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.110
Yun.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.000
(Defend the Nation and the Throne)
Why tear it?

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.870
Chun,

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.400
the commoners outside

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.340
are just making a fuss.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:15.880
How could you join them?

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.280
I feel proud.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.160
Yun,

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.360
our family

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.670
has regained its former glory.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.390
I think

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.000
if the deceased could see us now,

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.880
they would be proud, too.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.740
(Defend the Nation and the Throne)

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.280
Everyone sacrificed greatly

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.190
to win the battles of Qingzhou

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.630
and Fengling.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.140
But to single out one man

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.980
for all the praise is not a good thing.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:40.920
I fear there are people

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.060
stirring the waters

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:42.900
behind the scenes.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:43.980
Yun,

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.580
you're overthinking it.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.300
I'll go check on Chu Yu.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.180
She nearly lost her life

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.120
at the hot spring villa,

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.580
and her brother fought desperately

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:00.280
to guard Fengling.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.900
There are countless unsung heroes.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.100
Others may not feel sorry for them,

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:06.820
but I do.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.820
If I know this and still stay silent,

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.420
I can't live with myself.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.220
- Yun...
- Chun,

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.380
I've made up my mind.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.340
She and I risked our lives

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.180
to protect the realm,

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.700
yet we can't even fight

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.620
for our own happiness.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.460
How could I accept that?

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.420
Even in my darkest hour,

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:27.940
what I thought about

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.220
was when we could

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.060
love freely once.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.780
So,

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.060
I have to go see her.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.940
So, nothing can stop you now.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.460
Are you going to discipline me again?

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:46.700
Fine.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:47.920
I can go and see her afterward.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.020
Wei Qiu.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.340
Why would I stop you?

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.340
I am a woman

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.460
of my word.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.180
If you've thought it through,

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.900
then be ready
to face all that comes after.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.540
Thank you, Chun.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:14.740
(Defend the Nation and the Throne)

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.660
(Marquis of Zhenguo, Wei Yun)

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.420
I don't think this painting is good.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.000
It doesn't capture even a fraction

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:29.920
of Wei Yun's spirit.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.500
It's fine.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.360
It looks quite like him.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.060
We're here.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.070
(Langkeng Fish Tavern)
Remember?

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.540
Father used to bring you here

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.180
to drink

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.180
Rose Dew.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:43.500
Of course.

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:46.980
The owner here

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.420
never opens before the Xu hour.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:49.740
Luckily,

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.180
we don't curfew.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:52.540
That's right.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.660
He'd never brought me here.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.920
(Langkeng Fish Tavern)
Landlady.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:57.880
Two bottles of Rose Dew.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:58.820
Coming right up.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.260
Linyang,

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.140
tell me.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.540
What we're doing

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.020
is meaningful, right?

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:18.540
Of course.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.620
When Father took us

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.020
to the battlefield when we were kids,

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.660
he always told us,

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.140
"Life is hard."

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:32.940
"You must"

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.020
"protect yourselves."

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.500
Back then, I was too young

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.420
to remember the next line.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.260
"Life is hard."

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.480
"You must protect yourselves,"

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:50.540
"so you can protect others."

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.180
I used

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:58.940
to feel indignant.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.500
Why are we

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.780
always the ones left behind?

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.180
Perhaps it's because of our humble roots

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.140
or harsh fate.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.840
In this tangled web

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.820
of Great Sui's politics,

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.400
we're simply not meant
to have a name.

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:15.420
Yu...

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:17.220
But this time,

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.700
after returning to Huajing,

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.340
I saw the faces

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:24.620
in the city renewed.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.780
The people's smiles

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.220
were genuine

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.380
and peaceful.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.380
And at that moment, I knew

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.100
that protecting others

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.340
is meaningful.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.500
As expected of you.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.200
You're always so open-minded.
