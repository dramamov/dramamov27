=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
=Episode 12=

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.720
Meiqi.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.166
I bought a new charging cable.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.886
Here, try using this one.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.310
No, I have my own.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.086
This one's really good.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.590
You don't have to worry about me, Mom.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.640
I know.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.390
Just look at you.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.750
Meiqi.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.350
You're only going to Shanghai
for a one-day interview.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.550
Why are you bringing so much?

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.776
What could I possibly leave behind?

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.270
Laptop, face mask, cleanser, pyjamas.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.246
No, about the pyjamas.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.750
Don't bring a whole set.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.936
A simple T-shirt will do.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.830
No, it won't.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.646
Meiqi has worn silk pyjamas
since she was little.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.006
She can't sleep without them.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.960
Exactly, Mom knows me best.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.080
Meiqi.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.310
At your last class reunion,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.750
I kept calling you.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.240
I was just too anxious.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.520
My fault. I'm sorry.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.270
Mom.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.110
It's my fault.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.800
I shouldn't have turned off my phone.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.566
It's because your brother
had an accident.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.200
Since then,
I've been anxious all the time.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.270
When I can't see you, I panic.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.960
I know it's unreasonable.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.110
Your dad and I
sent you to study in the UK.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.640
We wanted you

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.246
to aim higher and go further.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.110
That's right.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.960
When you were studying in the UK,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.990
your mom couldn't sleep
for nights on end.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.550
You never told me that.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.126
If I had told you,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.850
how could you have focused
on your studies?

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.126
But Meiqi, you know,
from the moment you boarded that plane,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.966
my phone never once

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.390
was turned off.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.566
Every morning, the first thing I did

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.480
was check your spending record.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.366
No, I wasn't spying on you, you know.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.056
It's just through those records,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.456
I could tell what you were doing.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.056
Whether you were safe.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.246
In the morning,

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.360
I'd see a few transactions.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.056
I'd think, my daughter's bought coffee,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.406
had breakfast.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.406
By noon,

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.126
those charges

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.336
meant you'd gone out
with your classmates.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.296
And later on,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.846
I'd just feel reassured

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.150
whenever I saw those records.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.760
This time in Shanghai,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.430
I promise

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.640
I won't call you unnecessarily.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.806
But you have to promise me too.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.960
Don't turn off your phone, alright?

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.240
I promise, Mom.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.200
- Alright.
- All good.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.320
Go on and finish packing.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.846
Yes, go on then.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.270
Tell me if you need anything.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.800
(A new chapter of life
is about to begin.)

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.390
Meiqi.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.800
Simon?

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.230
It really is you. What a coincidence.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.770
We haven't seen each other
since graduation, have we?

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.030
Right. I went home a while ago.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.620
What about you? Why are you here?

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.760
I work here. I'm a trainee lawyer.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.206
You work here?

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.976
Yes.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.840
And you?

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.536
I'm here for an interview.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.400
What a coincidence.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.056
Let's have a meal together sometime.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.976
Sure.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.096
But not today, I'm in a hurry.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.616
Alright.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.680
Yes.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.220
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.070
My goodness.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.520
Dinner. Such a coincidence.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.310
Right, we haven't
added each other on WeChat.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.470
Quick, add me.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.520
Oh no!

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.096
What's wrong?

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.056
Feng!

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.126
My bracelet.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.446
I can't find my bracelet.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.976
Bracelet?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.656
It's alright, I'll help you look later.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.006
No, right now.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.616
You have to find it for me now.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.976
- Please, quickly!
- Alright.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.806
Find it now.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.700
Alright, I'll help you look.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.856
I've searched everywhere.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.976
My bracelet's gone.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.320
Do you know it's missing?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.520
I can't remember where I put it.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.936
Where's my bracelet?

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.760
Where on earth did my bracelet go?

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.590
This is driving me mad.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.790
Where did I put it?

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.990
Found it.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.760
Where did you find it?

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.000
On the counter in the bathroom.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.536
I checked the bathroom several times.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.976
But I didn't see anything.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.206
It was sitting right there.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.200
Goodness me.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.006
Am I blind? How did I not see it?

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.006
Lihua.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.656
Calm down, don't be so nervous.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.150
If you keep worrying like this,
you'll make yourself depressed.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.320
Why don't you go out for a walk?

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.640
Get some fresh air and relax a bit.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.830
It'll do you good.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.686
Alright.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.616
I'm not nervous now.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.326
Okay.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.366
I'm off to work.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.590
You're going out?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.480
Heavens.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.830
Goodness, I nearly had a heart attack.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.150
Answer the phone.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.140
(Nanxi Hotel)

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.230
Yes, Mr. Gu.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.440
If you have any requests,
please tell me directly.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.040
Alright.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.520
No problem.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.830
Rest assured.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.190
Okay.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.686
A tour group is arriving this afternoon.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.176
I've already assigned the rooms.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.350
Double-check them.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.430
Make sure they're well received.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.280
Alright.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.430
It's you.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.856
I saw you were busy,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.230
so I didn't want to interrupt.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.840
Well…

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.560
How are you feeling?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.200
Pretty good.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.566
Any nausea?

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.430
No.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.960
My appetite's been fine too.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640
Good. That's great.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.440
Oh, right, that…

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.686
Your uncle.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.550
Yes.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.350
My elder brother.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.960
He went traveling in Fujian
and bought some white fungus.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.886
Take it home and make white fungus soup.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.206
No, you keep it for yourself.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.830
Take it, make some soup.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.120
It's really good.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:08.760
Thank you.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.430
Thank you...

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:13.960
No need to thank me.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.520
Don't be so polite with me.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.616
Well…

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.120
I, um, I should get going.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.120
I'll leave you to it.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.230
Alright.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.710
Wait, wait a moment.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.920
Hold on a second.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.990
I packed some dried shrimp skins.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.056
They make the wonton soup
very flavorful.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.110
Take it and enjoy.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.280
Mingzhu.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.350
How did you know
I like dried shrimp skins?

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.560
I didn't know.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.750
My mom always taught me

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.710
never return an empty plate.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.920
(This daughter,)

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.590
(from head to toe,)

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.680
(shows every trace
of a well-raised child from another family.)

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.800
Alright.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.176
Time's up.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.110
You may begin.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.470
I believe customer loyalty

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.896
is the core of this project.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.776
However, the client's company

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.160
hasn't done much online promotion.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.376
If, in the next three to five years,

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.376
we can link both online
and offline efforts,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.326
for example,

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.606
making online discounts

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.536
exclusive benefits for members,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.936
to attract customers to shop offline,

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.710
I think it could be
an effective approach.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.710
Miss Feng.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.686
Mr. Shen will be
at the company tomorrow.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.400
Do you have time for a final interview?

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.800
Of course.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.606
We'll confirm the time and let you know.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.726
I'll be there on time.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.416
Thank you.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.510
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.416
Thank you.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.280
Thank you.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:20.790
This one's quite good.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.350
Mom.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:40.680
Feng Meiqi.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.680
Feng Meiqi, are you alright?

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.080
Let me see. Quickly, look.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.350
Are you hurt?

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:49.990
I'm fine.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.110
Feng Meiqi.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.200
This morning, I…

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.920
I started having hallucinations.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.680
I couldn't find my bracelet.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.486
I was afraid it had fallen and broken.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.376
You know,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.680
when jade breaks, it's a bad omen.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.750
The bracelet was right in front of me,
yet I couldn't see it.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.446
I was so scared.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.686
I was afraid that in Shanghai,

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.200
something might happen to you.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.086
My heart was racing.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.446
So I told the driver,

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.990
"Go, to Shanghai."

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.110
And I came straight here.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.296
It's fine.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.830
Mom, see? I'm fine.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.176
It's alright.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.446
I'm sorry, Meiqi.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.136
Did I disturb you?

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.280
No.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.630
The interview went well?

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.870
It went fine.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.110
Good.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:41.606
So,

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.160
you might be working here in the future?

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.640
Hello?

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:14.726
Miss Feng.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.870
Would 10:30 tomorrow morning be alright?

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:22.710
I'm sorry.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.750
Thank you for giving me
this opportunity.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.560
But something's happened at home,
and I may

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.920
need to go back to be with my mom.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:35.710
Thank you.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.700
Please, make yourselves at home.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.590
Everyone, just relax.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.110
This is the living room.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.450
And over here is the kitchen.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.776
We really spent quite
a bit on this place.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.510
It's almost like a palace.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.590
That's a bit much, Mom.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.950
What kind of palace
asks people to take off their shoes?

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.726
That's the baby cot.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.910
- Yes, just bought it.
- Take a look.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.160
Come, Mingzhu, have a look.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.920
The material is really good.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.960
See? Not a single nail in sight.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.510
Mr. Shen really knows his trade.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.176
My dad's nickname is Shen the Handy.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.990
He's brilliant at carpentry.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:32.726
Uncle Shen's impressive.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.806
You can tell he's a pro.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:34.870
An eighth-level carpenter.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.896
Mingzhu.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.536
We've installed automatic curtains here.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.440
They weren't working last time you came.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.846
Now they're fixed.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:44.776
Like this.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.686
The baby sleeps here,
and the adults keep watch.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.030
When the baby wakes up,
the curtain can be opened.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.176
No need to get up.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.750
Just press the remote
and it opens instantly.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.086
That's convenient.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.726
Yes, it is.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.726
If I'd had a room like this
when I was little,

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.100
I'd have made it to university long ago.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.326
Then this room's yours.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.536
Let's see if you can get in.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.136
Deal.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.000
No, you can't.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.256
No, I mean,

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.376
the bed's too small.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.200
He's too tall to fit.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.800
Just joking. Of course not.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.206
Yes.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.536
Meiqi, is the lift card ready?

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.056
Go fetch it.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.150
It's done, I'll get it now.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.700
Come, have a seat in the living room.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:17.686
Come on, sit.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.550
Alright.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.566
Please, this way.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:20.430
Sit here.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:21.880
Nice.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.760
You sit there.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.160
Sit down, please.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.016
Have some fruit.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.920
Fruit.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.920
Help yourselves.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.686
Mr. Shen, Mrs. Shen, one card each.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.220
It'll be convenient
when you visit next time.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.446
I don't need one.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.470
Take it, Mrs. Shen.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.806
Mingzhu already has one.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.080
So I made three cards.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.206
This one's yours.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.160
I've got one too.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.416
If you don't want it, fine.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.280
Give it here.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.776
We can just share one between us.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.040
No, no, it's better
if everyone has one. More convenient.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.350
Mingzhu.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.566
The children's room all sorted.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.536
The whole place has been deep-cleaned.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.326
Everything you and the baby might need

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:02.680
is ready and waiting.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.040
Why don't you move back in?

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.056
I'd rather stay at home.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:11.910
It's more comfortable.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.446
It's comfortable here too.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:14.606
And very convenient.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:15.326
That's right.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.136
Isn't it?

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.176
A house

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.870
only feels alive when people live in it.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.320
Exactly, Mingzhu.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.800
Come by whenever you can.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.680
If you'd rather not stay,
that's fine too.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.896
Just drop by, have a chat, share a meal.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.760
That's nice as well.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.160
Exactly.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.200
Then in a few days

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.326
I'll bring some clothes to leave here.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.566
No need, we've already
prepared everything for you.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.960
Only the best.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.110
Stay over tonight.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.686
Mom.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.560
Come with me to buy some wet wipes.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.910
No need, we have plenty at home.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.320
No, come on, let's go.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.416
The shop in the complex
is really convenient.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:57.766
Alright.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.776
Take your mom for a walk.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.950
Let her get used to the place.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.136
Sure.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.320
- Go on then.
- Alright.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.176
Off you go.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.846
If you need anything
from the shop, just take it.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.416
Put it on Mr. Feng's tab.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.280
That's right.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:09.670
Good.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.446
We'll go for a walk too.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.536
No, stay and sit.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.160
Meiqi, pour some tea.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.160
Mom.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.990
I want to move in.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.080
You've let them talk you into it.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.296
That family's difficult to deal with.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.326
If you move in,

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.510
how will you manage day to day?

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.320
Whether life's good
or bad depends on people.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.376
And on who you live with.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.966
That family's too hard to deal with.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.200
I know what I'm doing.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.320
I've thought a lot about it lately.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.280
I know they look down on me.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.320
Since Jianqi's gone,

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.590
they've been kind to me,

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.870
buying things and fixing up the flat.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.110
It's all for the baby I'm carrying.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.470
I know you and Dad care about me.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.006
Even without them,

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.936
we could still raise this child.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.816
Exactly.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.206
But have you thought about this?

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.160
If you and Dad look after the baby,

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.750
who'll run the restaurant?

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.896
And Minghui still needs to study.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.376
With a crying baby at home,

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.616
how can he concentrate?

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.616
We'll find a way.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.160
There's always a solution, right?

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.510
And what's the goal of finding one?

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.920
To cut ties with that family forever?

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.270
But they're the baby's grandparents.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.120
That's impossible.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.510
Right now, this baby

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.990
is their only emotional support.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.880
Otherwise his mom won't make it through.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.576
And Jianqi wouldn't rest easy either.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.680
Don't you think so?

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.680
If I move in,

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.920
the baby will have better conditions.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.136
You and Dad

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.816
can focus on running the business.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.470
And Minghui can study in peace.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.616
It's good for everyone.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.960
So why shouldn't we?

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.896
You child, honestly.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.096
You think about everything else,
but never about yourself.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.896
That woman's so overbearing.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.096
If you move in,
you'll have to swallow a lot.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.400
Meiqi told me,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.006
if her mom starts nagging again,

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.550
I'll just pretend she's singing.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.520
Mom.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.270
I've grown up.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.710
I can't always be you and Dad's baby.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.160
I'm about to be a mother myself.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.230
I'll take good care of myself.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.230
Alright, give it a try then.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.470
When the "singing" gets
too annoying, come home.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.160
Still be Mom's baby, okay?

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:46.446
You're back.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.310
We're back.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.680
How was the walk?

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.640
Nice. Well,

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.070
the neighbourhood really is nice.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.120
Yes.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.336
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Shen,

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.630
I almost forgot, I'll take you
to register your fingerprints later.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.246
Then you can unlock the door easily.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.176
That's not necessary. We can just knock.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:06.656
No.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.616
Do it.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.750
We're family now, aren't we?

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.510
Mom and I talked it over.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.600
I'll move in.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:17.766
That's wonderful.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.030
Wonderful, Mingzhu.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.656
Truly wonderful.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.680
So good.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.640
Yes, come here, Mingzhu.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.616
This was passed to me
by Jianqi's grandmother.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.400
Now I'm passing it on to you.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.680
You keep it, please.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.336
No, I'm pregnant now.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.046
It's inconvenient to wear a bangle.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.006
Be good.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.640
This is a family heirloom of the Fengs.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.550
Now it belongs to you.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.200
Wear it. It'll keep you safe.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.790
Right, Feng?

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.350
That's right.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.750
Put it on.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.070
Wear it properly.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.270
Thank you, Mom.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.510
Our daughter really has it hard.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.470
She's thought of everything.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.790
That's true.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.030
Mingzhu tends to overthink everything,

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.310
but she's clear-headed inside.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.550
Look at Meiqi.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.200
When she asked us
to register our fingerprints,

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.680
she was so happy watching.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.880
She just wants both families
to become one.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.160
I know that.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.360
Once the baby's born,

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.920
we'll be one family no matter what.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.046
The problem is,
they're hard to deal with.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.766
Looks like we can't avoid them for life.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.336
Stop thinking like that.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.200
Come on.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.936
You can't judge them with old thinking.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.360
Who would hand over
their house keys to you?

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.160
They did.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.336
It's just a key.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.936
If I give them ours, would they come?

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.246
They look down on you.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.286
Oh, stop it.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.990
What do we even have at home?

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.446
Besides, the baby's due soon.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.726
It'll still be cold
when she gives birth.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.110
Their place keeps a steady temperature
and humidity. Perfect.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.360
The baby will be comfortable.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:53.350
If she stayed at ours...

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:55.376
Don't.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.726
Listen, I'm telling you.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.310
Our daughter
needs proper postpartum rest.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.046
Otherwise, she could end up sick.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.440
I'll take care of her myself.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.096
Jianqi's mom fusses all day long.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.376
She can't do any real work.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.750
We can't count on her.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.640
You think they'd let you?

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.440
They'll hire a maternity nanny.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.200
That's expensive, you know.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.200
Give me that money instead,
I'll be the nanny.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:21.710
You and your money.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.096
Our daughter's too shy to ask directly.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.790
Let the money go through me first.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.550
I'll save it for her.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.750
That family's always
talking about the baby,

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.966
but they never do anything real.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.750
Just talk, right?

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.910
Real action.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.840
What mother asks for money
to care for her daughter?

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.486
You don't get what I mean.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.656
Did I say I wanted money?

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.920
It's for our daughter.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.336
You never listen properly.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.200
Dad.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:51.656
Why are you two so slow?

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.920
I've been waiting ages.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.250
- You weren't exactly fast on the bike.
- Water.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.400
Bought it for you.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.440
Stop wasting money.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.006
I used my own pocket money.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:01.410
One bottle's enough for both of us.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.200
You drink first.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:09.960
Oh right.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.136
Let's stop by Ni Debao's house later.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.000
What for?

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.960
To get some
of Xiaoni's old baby clothes.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.510
People say wearing
hand-me-downs brings good luck.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.790
And Xiaoni's so clever.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.230
Our grandchild will be just as smart.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.920
When the baby's born,

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.030
don't let him see anyone first.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.510
Especially not his uncle.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.680
That's true, definitely not.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.880
Why not, Mom?

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.200
Why not?

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.200
Why can't he see me?

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:38.966
He just can't.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.686
I've got plenty of old clothes too.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.120
I could give some to my nephew.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.030
Aren't I cleverer than Xiaoni?

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.176
You are clever,

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.856
just not in the right way.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.270
But at least I'm good-looking.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.480
Zhixia.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.880
This is our Castilla Berry Collection.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.576
Twelve shades in total, ten of each.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.160
That's one hundred and twenty pieces.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.856
I requested these
specially from headquarters.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.840
They're for the fans of Zhixia Speaks.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.720
Don't worry.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.030
I'll make sure the Berry Collection

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.160
gets plenty of traffic.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.120
Fearless Sister.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:14.840
Pleasure working with you.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.470
Pleasure working with you.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.310
Generous Brother.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.830
Xiu'e.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.096
I've kept all

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.336
of Xiaoni's clothes and toys.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.726
Let me find them for you.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:26.710
Alright, thank you.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.470
Eight-Treasure Health Tea.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.840
You make tea too?

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.486
I blended it myself.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.440
It nourishes the kidneys
and boosts energy.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.446
I've been drinking it for ages.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:37.880
Even my black hair's growing back.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.030
Dad, you don't have black hair,
it's all white.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.280
Xiaoni.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.440
You little rascal.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.840
Always speaking the truth.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.200
Ni Debao.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.046
That box on the cabinet.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.206
Come help me get it down.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.896
You two sit.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.686
Need a hand?

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:52.600
No, it's fine.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.750
Xiaoni.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.990
They say you're amazing.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.896
You take pulses so accurately. Come on.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.710
Why don't you check mine too?

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.160
Pregnancy pulse.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.910
What?

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:11.550
What?

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.680
Pregnancy pulse.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.100
(Pregnancy Test)

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.040
Ni Debao.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:40.960
Come in.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.400
Why is one pregnancy test missing?

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.920
No way.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.510
I didn't sell any.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.360
You didn't, and neither did I.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.510
There were five before.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.480
Look for yourself.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.270
Now there's one missing.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.230
I've got no idea.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.120
Don't look at me like that.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.816
There are only three of us here,
me, you, and Xiaoni.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.206
Could it be Xiaoni who took it?

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:16.020
So if it wasn't Xiaoni,
are you saying I took it?

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.286
Be honest with me.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.400
Did you get someone else
pregnant outside again?

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.360
Don't talk nonsense.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.030
Nonsense?

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:25.376
You know perfectly well

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.590
what trouble you've stirred up.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.486
Of course I do.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.936
Because I've done nothing wrong!

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.206
If not, why does your ex-wife
hate you so much?

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.136
Every day she puts your photo
facing our window to disgust us.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.200
She's sick in the head.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.336
She's sick? I must be too.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.416
If I'd known the truth back
at Nanxi Bridge,

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.160
I'd never have married you in a rush.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.400
What's the point of saying that now?

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.486
A man's youth isn't wasted on romance.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.136
That's all in the past.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.376
Since we got married,

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.726
tell me honestly, how have I behaved?

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.286
All I see is the surface.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.446
What about what I can't see?

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.270
I'm the same inside and out.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.816
Who would believe that?

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.470
- What are you doing?
- Tell me clearly.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.176
Where's the pregnancy test?

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.700
Don't tell me you're going
to hit me again.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.310
This isn't the first time.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.686
So what if I do?

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.470
I'll make it a daily habit.

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.096
If you don't tell me today,

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.446
we're done for good.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.966
Talk.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:11.230
Then we're done.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.910
- Who wants to stay with you anyway?
- Get back here.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.616
Come back here.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.576
You wild woman.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.856
- Where do you think you're going?
- You're insane.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.840
Stop right there.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.176
Where are you running off to?

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.880
Touch me again and I'll call the police.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.070
Aren't you afraid of making a scene?

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.446
I'm not afraid.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.206
Why should I be?

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.610
If you're not afraid, neither am I.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.286
Tell me the truth.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.220
Where's the pregnancy test?

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.840
Who did you give it to?

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.896
I swore on my own photo already.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.710
If you still don't believe me,
what can I do?

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.920
Believe you? Not a chance.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.686
You're insane.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:38.880
Now I'm starting to wonder

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.816
did you meet me before the divorce

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.120
or after it?

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:43.936
That's easy to prove.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.576
Just look at the divorce certificate.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.640
Where is it then?

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.486
Have you ever shown it to me?

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.096
The divorce certificate isn't with me.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.286
It's with that wild woman.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.766
I've never even seen it myself.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.540
Fine then, give me
my divorce certificate back.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:56.616
- Who are you calling a wild woman?
- Enough.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.446
- Then ask her.
- Mom.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:58.766
Was it after the divorce

00:26:58.790 --> 00:26:59.416
that I met her?

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.576
Answer me first.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.576
Did you divorce me
before meeting her or after?

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.576
Say it clearly.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.260
- You've never told the truth once.
- Shameless man.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:06.966
I must be blind
to have married two wild women.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.350
- Then hit him hard, hit him to death.
- I was blind to marry you.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:08.950
Alright, enough.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.830
That's enough, Mom. Let's go.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.830
We'll go home.
He needs to be taught a lesson.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.616
I'll call the police
if you hit me again.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.710
You wouldn't dare.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.336
Let me tell you,
when you find a boyfriend,

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.766
don't find someone like him.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.600
What if I end up just like Dad?

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.400
Then I'll cut ties with you too.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.006
So? What now?

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:37.030
(Caution: Slippery Floor)

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.600
Get ready to be a dad.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.640
What do you mean?

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.030
Scared me for nothing.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.470
See, I told you.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.710
You actually believed what a kid said?

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.046
Oh my, that scared me.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.096
Couldn't find the test.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.710
Hit me again and I'll fight back.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.336
You dare fight back?

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.830
If we don't find
that pregnancy test today,

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.896
I'm divorcing you.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.840
Fine by me, it's not my first time.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.726
Good.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:13.710
Then do it.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.120
Stop right there.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.896
Should we go and explain it to them?

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.120
Explain what?

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.470
That I'm not capable, right?

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.270
No, that's not what I meant.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.310
You're too old
to still be this childish.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.680
What are we going to do
about your maths?

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.856
Shall I enroll you in another class?

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.790
No. You don't even have the money.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.200
Mom.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.260
Have you finished your homework?

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.396
Not yet.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.130
She still need to memorize
one more poem for Chinese.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.820
And her maths still isn't done.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.340
Alright, go on then.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.580
Oh right.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.100
The head of Human Resources...

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.100
I'm coming.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.500
Stop rushing me, I'm here.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.420
No one even called him.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:02.460
Hello, Mom.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:03.860
Zhixia.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:05.820
How have you been lately?

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:06.916
Quite good.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.876
Jiao goes to Zhang Hao's place
after school to do her homework.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.340
I'll pick her up when I finish work.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.700
Do you need me to do anything for you?

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.420
A bit of persuasion.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:18.940
What do you mean?

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.340
What are you doing?

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.860
Why did Zhixia say

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.396
your name isn't on the candidate list?

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.700
Didn't you sign up?

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.100
I...

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.140
I just thought

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.550
being Head of Human Resources
means I can't leave work easily.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.596
Then who will pick Jiao up
from school every day?

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.076
You just focus on the competition.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.260
I'll handle Jiao.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.940
At worst, she can
walk home herself, right?

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:43.836
Yes.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.716
Children

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:45.876
need independence.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:46.740
That's right.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.956
Several of Jiao's classmates

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.716
already walk home by themselves.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.620
Isn't that right, Jiao?

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.836
Chen Liwen walks home alone.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.840
- I can walk home with her.
- Don't be ridiculous.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:56.836
Listen to me.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.996
You know Mr. Wang
from our logistics department,

00:29:59.020 --> 00:29:59.860
right?

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.780
His son used to go to and from school
alone every day.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.060
He had a car accident.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.220
Really, I'm not making this up.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.260
It's a lifelong regret.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.740
Nothing about a child
is ever a small matter.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.610
Being Head of Human Resources
isn't what matters.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.780
What matters is
you have to take care of your family.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.156
Besides, look at Zhixia now.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.340
She's heavily pregnant.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.020
Exactly, Mom.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.756
I'm carrying a big belly,

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.196
and I'm still out there
pulling in advertising deals.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:24.956
You're a grown man.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.396
Why aren't you more ambitious?

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.516
Why not aim higher?

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.740
Son, you have to strive
to do better in life.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.236
This world is so realistic now.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.396
If you don't lead others,

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.020
then others will lead you.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.620
You think having no title
makes you free?

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.196
You're light as a feather.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.356
Anyone with a puff of air

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.756
could blow you off balance.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.076
I'm not made of paper.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.276
Mom has a point.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.060
Other kids' dads are Mr. Wang or Mr. Li.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.580
Only my dad is Zhang.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:52.580
No, that's not right.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.076
In a few years, he'll be Old Zhang.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.420
And after that?

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.700
Then he'll be Elder Zhang.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.020
Elder Zhang.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.260
You...

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.860
I never would've imagined

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.116
the three of you would gang up on me.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:03.980
Mom.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.150
The vegetables are fine.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.540
Pass me a pair of chopsticks.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.066
Let's make a little toast then.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:14.026
My darlings.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:14.696
Come on.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.510
Cheers.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.396
You're still up this late.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.020
Why are you wandering around?

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.060
I can't sleep.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.420
What's wrong now?

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.436
You said yourself

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.356
you'd give me Grandma's jade bangle.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.220
And then what?

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.440
Feng Meiqi.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.260
I already know what you're going to say.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.156
What's that?

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.300
When I was in Shanghai,

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.916
I bought this dress
for your precious daughter-in-law.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.180
Send it to her.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:44.700
Really?

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:47.596
Let me see it.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.460
Praise me first.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:51.740
Very nice.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.940
Then I'm not showing you.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:06.620
Zhang Hao.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.700
Be honest with me.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.596
You prepared that thick stack

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.210
of documents
for the position application.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.980
Why didn't you hand it in?

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.940
We've been married for so many years.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.840
I can tell from the way you talk
whether you're telling the truth.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.876
Your mom said
she'll come again tomorrow.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.420
My mom? Don't let her come.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.180
I'll tell you the truth.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.820
You know Wu
from our design institute, right?

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.860
A couple of days ago,
he quietly came to see me.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.636
He said if he doesn't
get the Head position,

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.300
his wife will divorce him.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:44.900
Then what?

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.980
His family started
pulling strings and making calls.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.836
His contacts told him

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.220
that if they handle
senior colleagues like us,

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.780
he'll be fine.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.180
And then?

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.980
Then Wu said to me,

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:01.300
look,

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:03.260
after he becomes Head,

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.860
his salary will rise a level,

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.700
and the year-end bonus will rise too.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.050
But he said he doesn't want
the money. It's all mine.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.700
He just wants the title of Head.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.396
I thought that sounded fair.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.500
Why do I need a title for vanity anyway?

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.500
He does the work, you take the money.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.660
Yes, that's the idea.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.740
Zhang Hao, are you stupid?

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.636
If Wu becomes Director Wu,
what if he doesn't keep his promise?

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.100
What if he makes things hard for you?

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.356
What if he transfers you

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.516
to a construction site
for months on end?

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:29.420
What will you do then?

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.660
No, that's impossible.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.996
I know Wu. He's an honest man.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.620
Honest? He dug you such a big hole.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.556
You'll go talk to him tomorrow.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.420
Tell him.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.620
You must take part in this competition.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.180
Otherwise, your wife
will divorce you too.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.956
He won't believe that.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.720
He knows you're pregnant
with the second child.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:49.220
Who says being pregnant
means you can't divorce?

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.596
Once I make up my mind,

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.916
even if I were carrying
seven little heroes,

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:53.916
I'd still divorce you.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.610
There's no point
in saying things in anger.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.660
I'm serious, Zhang Hao.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.556
Go to Human Resources tomorrow.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.140
Submit your application materials.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.876
The registration has closed.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.916
It's not a national exam.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.980
A day or two late won't matter.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.356
Forget it, don't go alone.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.436
Go find Wu.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.770
Tell him you've changed your mind.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.420
Ask him to help you contact HR.

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.676
I believe he wouldn't dare refuse.

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:16.740
If I ask Wu...

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:17.796
No, but then,

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.820
won't that ruin
our working relationship?

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:22.580
Zhang Hao.

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.940
So you'd rather ruin your marriage?

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.756
Or ruin your relationship
with a colleague?

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.620
With the colleague.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.540
With the colleague.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.500
With the colleague.

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.660
Then that settles it.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.556
Sleep now. Be good.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.820
Watch your head.

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:40.740
Pull up the blanket.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:47.860
Baby.

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.340
When you're born, you must be a boy.

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.060
Dad doesn't prefer sons over daughters.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.116
Dad just wants another teammate.

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.660
What for, to take sides during fights?

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.060
To have someone to play football with.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.196
Zhidong, your brother-in-law
wants to play football.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.060
Arrange it.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:11.820
What are you doing?

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:12.980
Good night.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:15.356
You're…

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.060
You're trying to kill me, aren't you?

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.340
Come on, Hao, grab it!

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.620
Go for it, come on!

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.580
Hao, get up!

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.276
Are you faking it?

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.180
Ow, that hurts!

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.380
Get up quickly!

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:36.980
Can you even handle it?

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.220
Of course, I'm great at this.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.220
You could say I'm steady as a rock.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.500
Good, then prove it.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.060
Help this old rock up first.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.620
So much effort.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.140
All right.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.220
Let's start.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.276
Wasn't that it?

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.420
That was just the warm-up.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.300
Now the real match begins.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.660
Let's split into teams.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.236
How about we stick to the same side?

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.560
- You guys at one side.
- No, I need a break.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.140
- You can form another side later.
- I need a rest.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.100
I need a rest.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.820
Mingzhu.

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.156
This is a gift I picked
for you in Shanghai.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.380
You can wear it
as a maternity dress or on holiday.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.540
I hope you'll always stay beautiful.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:18.540
Jianqi.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.740
Look, isn't it nice?

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.220
Your sister gave it to me.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.860
Block him!

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.076
Don't let him through,
he'll take the middle!

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.780
Yes, block him! Don't let him pass!

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.420
He's going through the middle!

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.956
Hurry, he's going through the middle!

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.676
Stop him!

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.740
No, don't let him shoot!

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:41.236
Where's your dad?

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.140
Didn't see him.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.020
Uncle!

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.220
- Zhixia.
- Where's my dad?

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.940
There, look.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.140
Steady as a rock.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.020
Go find that rock.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.140
Dad!

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.020
If no...

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.156
- Water, please!
- Thanks, sweetheart.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.100
Thanks.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.756
Why are you sweating so much?

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:01.820
Dad's tired.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.020
You look exhausted, old man.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.060
I've been playing football
for about three hours.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.476
Listen to him brag.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.876
He only played for ten minutes.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.140
And drank two bottles of water.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.340
That's your dad's level of fitness.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.060
Just say what you mean.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.740
Nothing. Jiao,

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.740
tell your dad to take care of himself.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.500
After all,
we already lost one son-in-law.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.700
Xu Zhi...

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.780
Zhidong's right.

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.476
Jiao, what does your school teach?

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.396
Develop sports to strengthen
the people's health.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:42.540
Good.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.236
Give Dad a back massage.

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.500
You attack, keep going.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.940
Hit you instead.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.500
Feels good.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.700
Feels good.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:50.316
Hit harder.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.860
Referee, someone's hitting me!

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.540
That tickles, stop it!

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.060
You look amazing in that.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:00.380
Don't I?

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.660
I think it's just all right.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.756
It works as pyjamas at home.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:05.620
Name your price.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.980
If I were rich, I'd just give it to you.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.140
Don't be fake about it.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.780
Let me see how much it is.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.780
(10,234.00)

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:18.596
Fixed it,

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.500
half off then.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.340
Feng Meiqi bought it in Shanghai.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.060
It's a limited edition, one of a kind.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.180
Really.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.220
But it really suits you.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.276
How about this,

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.540
I'll be generous and give it to you.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.820
Stop pretending to be generous.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:34.340
I'll send you five thousand.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.220
Deal.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.540
Transfer's done.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.340
Then I'll buy gold bars for the baby.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:49.780
Try it on for me.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.420
I try?

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.876
I'm the customer, I paid five thousand.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.500
Can't I see how it looks on the seller?

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:56.676
You can, of course.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.180
You paid, you're the boss.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:00.596
I'll go change in your room.

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:01.036
No.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:01.610
Just do it here.

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:02.980
Put it on right here.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.340
All right.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:11.860
Your hair.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.380
Okay.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.300
Here's your model shot,
what do you think?

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.780
Looks great.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:18.916
Keep it then.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.780
Don't take it off.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.020
It's yours now.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.560
You're giving it to me?

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.080
With our relationship,
I'm basically your godmother.

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.660
So, think of it
as a red envelope from your godmother.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.780
Besides, it looks better on you.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.196
Look at me, big chest, tiny waist.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.860
But everything looks flat in this.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.180
It's fine, you were always quite flat.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.580
Your belly's even big.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:44.500
This one's good.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.500
I want this "Good Fortune" one.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.740
Grandma.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.780
Is your special
sour plum drink ready yet?

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.180
Yes, it's ready.

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.116
Come, Jiao, look.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.196
Look.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.020
See what Grandma made for you.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:01.860
Try it.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.116
Slow down.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:04.916
It's good.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:05.820
Good, isn't it?

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.916
And the pie, is it nice?

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:08.780
It's delicious.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.300
Better than pizza?

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.660
A hundred times better than pizza.

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.396
Grandma's food is the best.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.236
Hear that?

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.356
My girl always tells the truth.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.540
Yes, children never lie.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.476
I've told you,
that pizza you always eat outside.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.836
What's so good about it?

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.236
All the filling's exposed.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.316
You hold it and your hands
get covered in oil.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.476
How disgusting is that?

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.196
Right?

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.540
The main thing is you're wasting money.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.220
It's brother-in-law's money.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.316
Exactly. If you don't spend
his money, it's wasted.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.130
Yes, money's useless
if you take it to the grave.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:39.756
Dad, let me toast you.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:40.356
You child.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.036
Come.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.276
Come on, Zhixia.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.300
Have a pie.

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:45.700
Here.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.260
I don't want any.
Your cooking's too salty now.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:49.636
Blame the salt seller, then.

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:50.660
No, I mean, listen.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.596
You haven't even eaten it
and you say it's salty?

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.060
Didn't you eat the braised beef?

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.180
Dad, let me toast you again.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:56.516
All right.

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.196
Okay, Zhixia.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.156
I'll change.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.260
I'll change next time, all right, girl?

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:06.956
Zhixia.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.100
There's something I wanted to ask you.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.076
We'd like you

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.620
to book a hotel for us.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:14.556
Your dad and I were thinking

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.260
we should invite
Bichen's parents out for dinner.

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:18.900
Xu Zhidong.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.716
Congratulations.

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.500
Your parents finally remembered you.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.300
I could cry.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.380
Oh, stop it, you.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.956
How many people? What kind of setup?

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.316
Do her parents
have any dietary restrictions?

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:31.916
Not really.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.756
Just light on oil, salt, and spice.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.716
Her mom doesn't eat coriander.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.740
All right,
send me the details in a message.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:38.756
Yes.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.036
Yes, listen to your sister.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.116
Just our two families?

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:42.500
Yes, just the two families.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.900
As for the dishes,

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.836
you can decide, balance it out.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.260
Just follow what he said,

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.140
what your brother mentioned.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:50.820
Right.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.980
You all don't worry about it.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.060
I'll pay.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.436
You said it yourself.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.596
Yes, I did.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.260
Mom's money shouldn't go to waste.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.196
What's it got to do with you?

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.350
Come on, Dad, let me toast you.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.940
Then I'll book a big feast.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.860
Go ahead and book it.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:10.260
They've raised Bichen so well.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.940
Even if we served dragon meat,
it wouldn't be enough.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.276
Zhixia.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.196
Just book it at Lijun Hotel.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.260
What Lijun?

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.340
Let's just go with Nanxi Hotel.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.140
Their staff have sales targets to meet.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.500
We might as well
help Shen Mingzhu out a bit.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.380
Good.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.940
That's a great idea.

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.580
This way, Mingzhu

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.340
can join us for dinner too.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.740
That's not possible.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.916
This matter shouldn't be rushed.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.260
Why not?

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.076
Right.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.420
She's still working.
She won't have time to eat.
