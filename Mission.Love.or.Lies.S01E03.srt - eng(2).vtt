00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.800
- Hey Bright!
- What?

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.000
Someone spotted me.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.880
I always told you to watch from far away, don't let them catch you.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.520
But you messed up

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.120
It won't happen again.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.040
Your body is burning up.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.520
Alice!

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.320
Alice isn't feeling well at all. She has a high fever.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.080
Ploy, Peerachada Khunrak as Achi

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.160
Punch, Naphassanan Kalaphan as Patty

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.040
Tian, Atcharee Buakhiao as Alice

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.000
Kitty, Nunthaphuck Aranyakasemsuk as Chama

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.760
Wait a moment.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.560
Alice.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.960
Don't come in yet, Patty.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.880
Can I go in and check on her?

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.600
I think it's better to wait until tomorrow.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560
Why?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.600
Just to make sure Alice doesn't have a contagious disease that could spread to others.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.400
You're right, Patty.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.680
If it's what Achi said, that would be bad.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.280
If someone else gets sick, we won't be able to handle it here.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.040
How is Alice doing now?

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.360
She's weak. High fever. But she's already taken fever medicine.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.200
If the fever goes down tonight, she should feel better tomorrow.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.760
It's probably just a common illness.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.360
Okay, then please take care of Alice for me.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.720
I will. I'll take care of Alice.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.120
You take care of yourself too, Patty.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.560
Chama, please take care of Patty as well.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240
Okay.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.280
Uh, Achi, you take care of yourself too.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.480
Don't worry about me.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.200
I'll take care of things on this end myself.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.040
Okay.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.400
Eat something, Patty.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.440
Water.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.840
Thank you.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.840
You're welcome.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.400
If you need anything else, just let me know.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.160
The fever should be going down now.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.320
Damn, I didn't report anything to P'Tee today.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.960
What happened? I completely disappeared.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.400
Why haven't I received any situation reports from you today?

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.840
I called and you didn't answer. What's the reason?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.400
Whoa, which question should I answer first?

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.040
Sorry, P'Tee. Something came up.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.000
What? Tell me.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.960
Patty's bodyguard isn't feeling well.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.720
Really? Is it serious?

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.120
Pretty serious. Fever went up to 40 degrees.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.840
Good thing she didn't go into shock.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.520
Can you handle it?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.680
Of course. I studied nursing before. This is easy for me.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.400
Good. Does she need to see a doctor?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.200
I don't think so yet. Let me wait and see tonight.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.480
Because recently, the fever has gone down a bit.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.320
If you need help with anything, let me know. And don't disappear like this again.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.200
Sorry, P'Tee. I won't disappear again in the future.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.600
When she's still and quiet, not talking or causing trouble,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.120
she's actually quite cute.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.960
Don't... don't leave me.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.960
I don't want to be alone.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.880
I'm not leaving you anywhere. I'll stay here and take care of you.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.920
Dad, Dad, don't go.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.800
She must really miss her father.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.640
I'm getting caught up in this.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.960
For the next news story,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.720
it's a continuing story about Phirom Siwatchaponlakai,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.400
the famous minister,

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.160
after being attacked several months ago.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.280
But recently, Phirom went to the area to encourage and visit the villagers

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.480
who are experiencing flooding problems.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.120
Upon arrival, he apologized to the people and said that from now on,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.120
he will return to his duties as normal, as he had promised the people.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.720
Are you awake?

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.440
I'm awake.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.520
You barely slept last night, Patty.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.440
Do you want to sleep a little longer?

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.200
No, I'm okay.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.840
I'm going to take a shower first.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.280
You're my bride.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.240
Achi, wake up!

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.680
Achi, wake up!

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.960
- Wake up! Wake up!
- Ow!

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.080
Wake up!

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.280
What's wrong with you?

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.480
What happened to my clothes?

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.200
Well...

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.120
I changed them. Who could stand it? They smelled so bad.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.240
Go take a shower...

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.520
I'll go shower first.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.960
You're crazy, senior!!

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.680
She was delirious about her father, so I went out of my way to sleep beside her.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.000
Do good, get nothing good in return. Sigh~

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.120
By the way,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.480
Hey!

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.960
Am I your bride?

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.800
Hey! No way.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.120
Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.520
Better go back to sleep.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.640
There's a garden here too.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.920
Bring your phone.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.640
Is that okay?

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.600
Of course. Why wouldn't it be?

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.640
Normally we shouldn't be ordering the boss around like this.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.040
If Achi sees this, Chama will definitely get scolded.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.920
Then don't tell her.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.360
Come on, I'll take a photo for you.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.760
1, 2!

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.680
Okay, one more photo.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.520
Look at this.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.920
Or... are you falling in love?

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.120
I like Achi. How could I fall in love with someone else?

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.040
We... should do something fun together, shouldn't we?

00:12:24.068 --> 00:12:27.128
Sponsored by Pro Fresh Milk

00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.808
What would Patty like to drink?

00:12:44.348 --> 00:12:47.398
I'll have sweet Thai tea.

00:12:47.398 --> 00:12:49.098
Then wait for Chama for a moment.

00:12:58.868 --> 00:13:01.418
One Thai tea with less sugar, please.

00:13:01.418 --> 00:13:02.078
Okay.

00:13:07.048 --> 00:13:10.368
Can I add one more matcha latte?

00:13:10.368 --> 00:13:11.238
Sure.

00:13:11.238 --> 00:13:12.078
Thank you.

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:18.878
We use Pro Fresh milk, ready-to-drink fresh milk, for every perfect menu item.

00:13:18.878 --> 00:13:20.338
It enhances the flavor of every brewed drink.

00:13:46.188 --> 00:13:48.188
Here you go.

00:13:48.188 --> 00:13:51.028
Thai tea with less sugar for Patty.

00:13:51.028 --> 00:13:52.038
Thank you.

00:14:00.148 --> 00:14:03.168
Mmm, delicious.

00:14:03.168 --> 00:14:04.668
So refreshing.

00:14:11.458 --> 00:14:15.268
Should we order room service for those two?

00:14:15.268 --> 00:14:16.408
Um, that's good.

00:14:16.758 --> 00:14:19.848
For someone who's sick, it should be congee.

00:14:19.848 --> 00:14:23.418
For Achi, fried rice with lots of eggs.

00:14:25.248 --> 00:14:26.508
You really know each other well.

00:14:27.268 --> 00:14:28.508
Of course.

00:14:28.508 --> 00:14:30.898
When it comes to Achi, I know everything.

00:14:31.048 --> 00:14:33.668
Better than my own parents even.

00:14:38.118 --> 00:14:40.488
Should we go visit those two?

00:14:40.488 --> 00:14:41.908
Um, good idea.

00:14:41.908 --> 00:14:43.388
Then I'll go with you.

00:14:43.388 --> 00:14:45.568
So I can find out how Alice is doing.

00:15:04.068 --> 00:15:04.808
Oh!

00:15:05.128 --> 00:15:05.988
Hello, Pin.

00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:07.488
Hello, please have a seat.

00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.028
Did Pin follow me here today for something?

00:15:12.638 --> 00:15:14.478
I'm worried about my children.

00:15:16.748 --> 00:15:18.448
The children are doing well, right?

00:15:19.408 --> 00:15:22.268
I'm sorry I haven't updated you on the news.

00:15:22.268 --> 00:15:24.328
I've been a bit busy with work.

00:15:24.328 --> 00:15:26.368
But everyone is doing well.

00:15:27.108 --> 00:15:28.098
It's okay.

00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.948
Phirom, he's fine.

00:15:31.228 --> 00:15:33.318
But I'm concerned.

00:15:33.968 --> 00:15:34.848
Why?

00:15:35.928 --> 00:15:39.468
I'm anxious, so I had the detective come today.

00:15:40.308 --> 00:15:42.788
I hope I'm not disturbing your time, Detective.

00:15:42.998 --> 00:15:45.668
Not at all. Everyone is doing well right now.

00:15:45.668 --> 00:15:47.018
Pin doesn't need to worry.

00:15:48.168 --> 00:15:49.188
That's good then.

00:15:51.028 --> 00:15:54.348
Everything is still going according to the plan I laid out.

00:15:54.348 --> 00:15:58.218
You can trust me. Our plan will definitely succeed.

00:16:00.758 --> 00:16:02.468
- Thank you. - Yes.

00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.778
P'Tee, are you awake?

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:15.118
Yeah, I'm at the police station.

00:16:15.118 --> 00:16:16.348
How was today?

00:16:17.378 --> 00:16:18.558
Same as usual.

00:16:19.718 --> 00:16:20.688
What about Alice?

00:16:21.318 --> 00:16:23.858
Her fever's gone down. She should be fine now.

00:16:25.058 --> 00:16:26.068
Has she woken up?

00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:28.788
Not yet, but she got up to take medicine.

00:16:29.168 --> 00:16:30.028
Good.

00:16:31.488 --> 00:16:34.488
Hey, P'Tee, what about the man in black? What should we do?

00:16:34.488 --> 00:16:35.828
I don't think it's anything.

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.828
Probably just a worker from around there. Don't get all worked up.

00:16:39.568 --> 00:16:42.038
Wow! How chill can you be?

00:16:45.518 --> 00:16:48.418
Shouldn't we move to another location just to be safe?

00:16:49.378 --> 00:16:50.338
No need.

00:16:52.868 --> 00:16:53.738
But P'Tee...

00:16:53.738 --> 00:16:55.028
Trust me.

00:16:55.028 --> 00:16:57.478
Unless I give orders, you don't need to do anything.

00:16:58.968 --> 00:17:01.248
So you're going to wait for them to do something to us first?

00:17:03.108 --> 00:17:05.088
Has anything happened yet?

00:17:05.088 --> 00:17:07.268
Therefore, just stay put for now. Understand?

00:17:08.838 --> 00:17:09.888
Hey, Achi!

00:17:11.168 --> 00:17:12.098
Hey!

00:17:12.478 --> 00:17:13.698
After you read this, please reply.

00:17:15.718 --> 00:17:20.238
Don't move anywhere until I give you orders. Understand?

00:17:24.518 --> 00:17:25.108
Okay.

00:17:33.808 --> 00:17:35.868
Achi, you're here already?

00:17:37.278 --> 00:17:40.118
You're here early. I was just about to call you.

00:17:40.448 --> 00:17:41.798
About breakfast, right?

00:17:42.578 --> 00:17:45.578
Patty and I are already taken care of.

00:17:45.578 --> 00:17:49.308
This is for Achi and Alice.

00:17:50.638 --> 00:17:51.938
Thank you.

00:17:56.178 --> 00:18:00.288
Uh, Patty doesn't look well. Is something wrong?

00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:03.068
Uh, probably didn't sleep much.

00:18:03.428 --> 00:18:04.768
I'm fine now.

00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:09.738
How's Alice?

00:18:10.098 --> 00:18:11.768
I'm better now.

00:18:16.378 --> 00:18:17.558
Achi.

00:18:18.288 --> 00:18:20.578
Can I talk to you for a moment?

00:18:21.158 --> 00:18:22.078
Sure.

00:18:27.308 --> 00:18:28.908
Let's talk outside.

00:18:30.338 --> 00:18:31.188
Outside.

00:18:46.808 --> 00:18:47.888
How are you feeling?

00:18:48.148 --> 00:18:51.258
I still have a headache and body aches.

00:18:52.128 --> 00:18:54.258
But it's better than two days ago.

00:18:55.928 --> 00:18:57.218
Good that you're better.

00:18:57.718 --> 00:19:01.218
Then just rest a lot. You'll recover faster.

00:19:02.818 --> 00:19:04.038
And...

00:19:04.038 --> 00:19:06.158
Don't worry about other things.

00:19:06.458 --> 00:19:07.728
Don't think about anything.

00:19:08.338 --> 00:19:11.848
Just focus on recovering from your illness.

00:19:12.228 --> 00:19:14.538
But I've never been this sick before.

00:19:16.748 --> 00:19:19.008
Like when I was designing clothes,

00:19:19.008 --> 00:19:22.608
I didn't sleep for two days and two nights and I was still fine.

00:19:22.608 --> 00:19:26.818
But this time, I'm unwell, passed out for days without consciousness.

00:19:27.438 --> 00:19:30.408
It's really strange. I feel bad.

00:19:31.978 --> 00:19:33.998
Look, don't overthink it.

00:19:33.998 --> 00:19:37.488
It might be because of accumulated fatigue.

00:19:43.118 --> 00:19:44.018
Uh,

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:47.408
I really miss home. I miss my father so much.

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:53.188
Is it possible for me to go back and see him?

00:19:54.468 --> 00:19:56.178
Think about it.

00:19:56.178 --> 00:19:59.508
Since I came back, I haven't seen his face at all.

00:20:00.938 --> 00:20:02.628
I miss him so much.

00:20:07.728 --> 00:20:09.098
I understand.

00:20:10.328 --> 00:20:11.088
But...

00:20:17.928 --> 00:20:20.988
Um, okay.

00:20:22.068 --> 00:20:25.138
I'll help talk to them myself.

00:20:26.498 --> 00:20:27.178
Okay?

00:20:27.388 --> 00:20:28.208
Really?

00:20:29.768 --> 00:20:30.868
Thank you so much.

00:20:32.578 --> 00:20:33.988
I love you the most.

00:20:36.388 --> 00:20:37.778
I love you too.

00:20:49.388 --> 00:20:52.378
Why are you making that face? Did you have a fight with Patty?

00:20:53.158 --> 00:20:54.958
No.

00:20:55.368 --> 00:20:58.718
I saw you walking here laughing happily.

00:20:59.088 --> 00:21:01.628
Then you come like this with that face. Why?

00:21:03.298 --> 00:21:06.528
I don't know. I feel strange.

00:21:06.658 --> 00:21:08.228
But I can't explain what it is.

00:21:08.838 --> 00:21:10.708
Are you getting your period?

00:21:11.488 --> 00:21:15.498
Normally when you're with me, you're quite lively and annoying to death.

00:21:16.028 --> 00:21:18.568
When you're like this, I don't know how to act either.

00:21:23.888 --> 00:21:24.758
That's right.

00:21:25.318 --> 00:21:28.498
Even though I'm this close to Achi,

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:31.818
I still don't really trust you that much.

00:21:33.188 --> 00:21:37.088
Oh! What's wrong with me?

00:21:39.248 --> 00:21:44.308
Or are you falling in love?

00:21:46.378 --> 00:21:47.338
Crazy!!

00:21:47.658 --> 00:21:49.018
What are you saying, Achi?

00:21:49.018 --> 00:21:51.848
I like Achi. How could I fall in love with someone else?

00:21:52.248 --> 00:21:53.088
You speak without thinking.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:54.538
You can.

00:21:55.298 --> 00:22:00.288
When you're with me, it might be because of attachment. So it becomes familiarity.

00:22:01.758 --> 00:22:03.678
- Really? - Yeah.

00:22:04.078 --> 00:22:06.218
Think about it carefully.

00:22:06.498 --> 00:22:09.558
During this time, who do you feel special being with,

00:22:09.558 --> 00:22:11.908
or happier than before?

00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:21.598
Hey Achi! What are you doing?

00:22:21.888 --> 00:22:25.788
Why did you put my hand on your breast?

00:22:26.578 --> 00:22:28.888
Are you crazy? I wasn't thinking like that.

00:22:28.888 --> 00:22:32.018
I just wanted you to notice that you're touching me.

00:22:32.018 --> 00:22:36.068
And do you still feel your heart racing like when you first got close to me?

00:22:41.088 --> 00:22:41.878
Hey!

00:22:43.108 --> 00:22:44.118
What's wrong with you?

00:22:45.288 --> 00:22:46.868
I really don't feel anything.

00:22:48.918 --> 00:22:49.848
See?

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:54.248
This alone shows that you don't like me the same way as before.

00:23:01.678 --> 00:23:06.498
After Patty and her close friend returned to Thailand several days ago,

00:23:06.498 --> 00:23:11.938
it was necessary for them to be under the care of Police Lieutenant Natee Weeratrakul, or Detective Tee,

00:23:12.208 --> 00:23:15.798
due to concerns about safety issues

00:23:15.798 --> 00:23:18.448
until the case of the attack on Phirom is closed

00:23:18.448 --> 00:23:21.978
and all the criminals are successfully arrested and brought to justice.

00:23:22.808 --> 00:23:27.038
We'll connect with Detective Tee now to see how the situation is.

00:23:31.568 --> 00:23:33.738
How is Patty doing now?

00:23:33.998 --> 00:23:37.488
Patty's overall situation is currently normal and good.

00:23:38.848 --> 00:23:41.028
Eat first, then you can take medicine.

00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:47.698
I think you don't have much strength. I'll feed you instead.

00:23:47.988 --> 00:23:49.248
Otherwise it'll spill everywhere.

00:23:50.478 --> 00:23:51.718
Okay.

00:24:17.478 --> 00:24:19.638
Patty, Patty.

00:24:20.618 --> 00:24:21.518
What is it?

00:24:23.318 --> 00:24:26.778
Should we do something fun together?

00:24:42.598 --> 00:24:43.978
It's all messy.

Here.

00:25:30.806 --> 00:25:32.426
Egg-topped bread.

00:25:34.606 --> 00:25:36.546
Egg-topped bread.

00:25:38.706 --> 00:25:39.716
You know how to make this?

00:25:40.646 --> 00:25:42.816
From what I've seen, it shouldn't be too difficult.

00:25:44.316 --> 00:25:45.096
Really?

00:25:48.286 --> 00:25:51.816
Yeah, sure. Then I'll help.

00:26:49.216 --> 00:26:50.156
Uh...

00:26:50.916 --> 00:26:53.356
I'm going to prepare the ingredients first.

00:26:54.136 --> 00:26:55.036
Okay.

00:27:10.006 --> 00:27:13.016
Eat a lot so you'll recover quickly.

00:27:20.816 --> 00:27:21.996
It's all messy.

00:28:00.356 --> 00:28:01.666
Give me some water.

00:28:08.436 --> 00:28:09.656
Don't rush.

00:28:14.616 --> 00:28:15.556
Okay then.

00:28:17.916 --> 00:28:20.476
Then... eat a little more.

00:28:23.946 --> 00:28:27.396
It's a senior's order. Junior must finish it.

00:28:57.956 --> 00:28:58.916
That's not it.

00:29:00.166 --> 00:29:01.256
How is that possible?

00:29:02.476 --> 00:29:04.746
Oh, it must be something else for sure.

00:29:04.746 --> 00:29:09.026
I like Achi, okay? Remember that. I like Achi. I like Achi.

00:29:09.776 --> 00:29:10.756
What are you saying?

00:29:19.606 --> 00:29:22.316
Wow, you're really good at this.

00:29:22.696 --> 00:29:24.316
You found everything we need.

00:29:26.116 --> 00:29:29.166
If something wasn't available, I would have run over there.

00:29:29.576 --> 00:29:31.196
The dining room has plenty.

00:29:32.176 --> 00:29:37.206
But I think actually we could just ask the chef to make it for us.

00:29:37.766 --> 00:29:41.936
Wow, having someone else make it won't taste as good as making it yourself.

00:29:42.386 --> 00:29:45.236
It fills both your stomach and your heart.

00:29:48.826 --> 00:29:51.626
Yeah, you're right.

00:29:52.586 --> 00:29:54.856
Should we start making it then?

00:29:58.712 --> 00:30:00.956
Here, Patty, help...

00:30:02.056 --> 00:30:02.889
Okay.

00:30:03.636 --> 00:30:05.546
And I'll slice the sausage.

00:30:14.376 --> 00:30:15.556
Hey!

00:30:29.246 --> 00:30:30.436
Teach me, teach me.

00:30:31.486 --> 00:30:32.406
Smells so good.

00:30:51.556 --> 00:30:55.036
Sorry, I didn't think it would be this difficult.

00:30:55.466 --> 00:30:56.526
It's okay.

00:30:56.526 --> 00:30:58.926
Even though we didn't get to eat egg-topped bread,

00:30:59.376 --> 00:31:01.686
I had a lot of fun.

00:31:03.326 --> 00:31:05.456
- Really? - Yeah, really.

00:31:06.596 --> 00:31:08.496
Even though it wasn't good for the taste buds,

00:31:08.496 --> 00:31:10.706
but...

00:31:11.886 --> 00:31:14.186
it was very good for the heart.

00:31:16.936 --> 00:31:18.266
Uh, like this.

00:31:18.706 --> 00:31:20.076
I'll come back. Wait a moment.

00:31:32.996 --> 00:31:35.166
This is fever reducer.

00:31:35.796 --> 00:31:37.716
And this is anti-inflammatory medicine.

00:31:39.456 --> 00:31:40.386
Anti-inflammatory medicine.

00:31:41.126 --> 00:31:44.506
I think you've been exercising too much.

00:31:44.506 --> 00:31:48.426
Your body aches are probably also from muscle inflammation.

00:31:48.856 --> 00:31:50.096
Hmm.

00:31:50.916 --> 00:31:51.956
Thank you.

00:31:52.036 --> 00:31:52.856
Take it.

00:31:53.306 --> 00:31:57.966
Uh, but senior, I don't like taking pills with plain water.

00:31:57.966 --> 00:32:01.266
It doesn't go down smoothly.

00:32:01.266 --> 00:32:05.816
If I'm going to take it without it getting stuck in my throat, I need to take it with fruit juice.

00:32:06.126 --> 00:32:10.236
Uh, can I have fruit juice? Please?

00:32:10.236 --> 00:32:11.126
Sure.

00:32:11.126 --> 00:32:14.526
Then wait for me a moment. I'll go get some from the dining room for you.

00:32:21.103 --> 00:32:25.076
Hey, why are you being so nice today? Strange.

00:32:30.486 --> 00:32:31.466
What did you say?

00:32:32.006 --> 00:32:33.286
What? You want to go home?

00:32:33.946 --> 00:32:37.086

Hey!!

00:33:13.674 --> 00:33:15.394
Why were you gone so long?

00:33:17.954 --> 00:33:20.654
Why? Did you miss me?

00:33:21.484 --> 00:33:22.964
Crazy!!

00:33:23.454 --> 00:33:26.064
I saw you were gone for a while. Thought you'd abandoned me.

00:33:26.534 --> 00:33:31.334
Well, I saw that you have a fever and need lots of vitamin C.

00:33:32.094 --> 00:33:34.324
So I brought you orange juice by the pitcher.

00:33:35.254 --> 00:33:39.794
Let me tell you, I squeezed this pitcher with my own hands.

00:33:40.134 --> 00:33:41.584
Mmmmm.

00:33:42.384 --> 00:33:44.014
Why are you so kind, senior?

00:33:59.384 --> 00:34:01.384
Yeah, I'm better.

00:34:01.384 --> 00:34:02.664
I have to thank you, senior.

00:34:02.914 --> 00:34:07.694

I'm so good at taking medicine.

00:34:21.484 --> 00:34:23.884
Come on, get up. Take your medicine.

00:34:24.204 --> 00:34:26.184
Oh!!

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.514
Wait, let me mentally prepare.

00:34:30.214 --> 00:34:34.724
I went to all the trouble to squeeze orange juice for you. You have to take your medicine.

00:34:35.284 --> 00:34:37.714
Then let me taste your orange juice first.

00:34:37.714 --> 00:34:40.234
If it's not good, I won't take the medicine.

00:34:40.624 --> 00:34:41.584
Fine.

00:34:41.974 --> 00:34:46.324
But if it's good, you have to finish this whole pitcher of orange juice.

00:34:46.854 --> 00:34:47.844
Okay.

00:34:55.674 --> 00:34:56.864
Hurry up.

00:34:58.394 --> 00:35:00.624
Hey, did Patty make this herself?

00:35:00.624 --> 00:35:02.044
Yeah, I did.

00:35:03.874 --> 00:35:06.474
I think it should be time to open the lid.

00:35:07.304 --> 00:35:08.214
Okay.

00:35:13.844 --> 00:35:17.754
Ooh! It looks better than mine.

00:35:18.064 --> 00:35:20.814
But without your sausage and ham,

00:35:21.314 --> 00:35:23.424
it probably wouldn't look this good.

00:35:23.954 --> 00:35:25.264
- Really? - Yeah.

00:35:25.724 --> 00:35:28.034
Thank you. I feel much better now.

00:35:30.334 --> 00:35:31.234
Then...

00:35:32.574 --> 00:35:33.404
Let's eat together.

00:35:37.814 --> 00:35:40.504
Hey, Chama, what are you thinking about?

00:35:40.784 --> 00:35:42.404
- Eating instant noodles. - Yes.

00:35:44.824 --> 00:35:45.744
Hey!

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:25.264
For the next news story,

00:36:25.264 --> 00:36:27.854
it's news that's been continuing for several days now.

00:36:27.854 --> 00:36:32.484
That is the news about Seer Phirom Sriwatcharapholkamlai, the famous minister.

00:36:32.484 --> 00:36:33.564
Oh, right.

00:36:34.294 --> 00:36:35.984
I completely forgot about that.

00:36:44.284 --> 00:36:45.904
Where is he?

00:36:50.254 --> 00:36:52.894
What? You want to go home?

00:36:53.214 --> 00:36:55.934
No way. We didn't plan for this from the start.

00:36:55.934 --> 00:36:58.954
If Detective Natee finds out, we'll definitely be in trouble.

00:36:58.954 --> 00:37:00.334
Then don't tell him.

00:37:00.944 --> 00:37:02.114
How can we not?

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:04.564
Please.

00:37:04.944 --> 00:37:06.684
I miss my father so much.

00:37:06.684 --> 00:37:10.064
Since I came back, I haven't had a chance to see him at all.

00:37:12.194 --> 00:37:15.844
Recently they eliminated the mistress angle, leaving 3 issues.

00:37:15.844 --> 00:37:17.884
The main issue is the quarrel,

00:37:17.884 --> 00:37:20.634
and the second issue is about local politics,

00:37:20.634 --> 00:37:23.504
and the last issue is business conflicts.

00:37:23.884 --> 00:37:29.054
This morning, forensic officers went to collect fingerprints at the scene again.

00:37:29.054 --> 00:37:33.174
So you're better now, right?

00:37:33.484 --> 00:37:35.484
Yeah, I'm better.

00:37:35.484 --> 00:37:39.754
Good. Next time take better care of yourself. Don't get sick again.

00:37:40.334 --> 00:37:41.714
Thanks for worrying about me.

00:37:44.214 --> 00:37:48.854
What were you talking to Achi about then?

00:37:50.324 --> 00:37:52.154
Oh, well...

00:37:52.314 --> 00:37:54.794
Nothing really. Just normal work stuff.

00:37:55.264 --> 00:37:57.894
Um, okay.

00:37:59.324 --> 00:38:04.394
Speaking of which, I'm curious what those two were talking about.

00:38:05.354 --> 00:38:06.244
Right.

00:38:06.944 --> 00:38:11.204
But I think if it wasn't a secret, they would tell us. Right?

00:38:12.934 --> 00:38:13.974
That's true.

00:38:16.584 --> 00:38:18.134
It's still not possible.

00:38:19.052 --> 00:38:20.332
Please.

00:38:20.423 --> 00:38:24.009
Right now I see that my father is out in the field too. I'm very worried about him.

00:38:24.614 --> 00:38:27.374
I'm afraid, afraid that I won't see him again.

00:38:28.684 --> 00:38:30.714
Is Patty overthinking?

00:38:30.714 --> 00:38:32.094
Your father will be fine.

00:38:32.094 --> 00:38:35.234
Detective Natee is taking care of things. Don't worry at all.

00:38:35.654 --> 00:38:37.204
How can I not worry?

00:38:37.204 --> 00:38:40.044
Can you guarantee that one day it won't go wrong?

00:38:42.114 --> 00:38:43.304
Please.

00:38:44.444 --> 00:38:48.454
Just this once. I won't ask you for anything else again.

00:38:49.784 --> 00:38:50.984
I'm afraid.

00:38:51.314 --> 00:38:54.834
I'm afraid that I won't see my father again.

00:38:58.504 --> 00:38:59.994
But...

00:39:00.144 --> 00:39:03.254
Please, Achi.

00:39:05.314 --> 00:39:06.224
Please.

00:39:11.274 --> 00:39:12.744
Please, Achi.

00:39:15.834 --> 00:39:20.234
I'll break the rules to help you just this once, Patty.
