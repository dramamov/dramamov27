DEAR X

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.722
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.515
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.269
Jun-seo.

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:05.648
Help me.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.947
I want to learn to love him.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.911
Heo In-gang.

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.959
LENA
YOU HAVE TO STAY AWAY FROM HER

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:27.837
SHE'S A COMPLETE PSYCHO

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.923
TEN PLANET RYU JI-HYEOK
HEY, CONGRATS ON THE AWARD

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.841
I ENJOYED YOUR NEW MOVIE

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.676
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
STILL IN THE SHOWBIZ

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.261
IS EVERYTHING GOOD?

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.479
Why are you here?

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:30.233
I asked you a question.
Didn't you hear me--

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:31.985
What's this?

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:33.903
Get out!

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.531
Get your hands off me.

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:39.617
I'm no longer someone
you can lay hands on.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.871
So you've got a pretty face
and a few seconds of fame.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.415
How long do you think you'll last
in a place you don't belong?

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:46.916
Go ahead. Thrash around.

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:51.546
You think you can hide the fact
that you killed your parents?

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.090
The one thrashing is you.

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:58.720
It must burn you up
that a nobody like me is thriving.

00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:02.974
It makes me laugh

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.101
when you do this now.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.520
You little--

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.195
Why do you think I came to Jun-seo?

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.574
You should have kept quiet
if you didn't want to see me.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.159
What was your plan

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:23.119
going to my boss?

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.746
Do I have to spell it out?

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:28.833
To expose your ugly truth.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.668
People deserve to know

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:34.172
that you've got
way too much dirt to be on TV.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.258
I'm going to tell them all.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.929
Your smiles and your tears...

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.222
They're all fake.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:45.391
You act helpless and pitiful
when it benefits you.

00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:48.019
And now you're acting
like nothing's wrong.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:54.359
You think I don't know
you killed both your parents?

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:56.527
You little devil. Die!

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.863
Die! Die already!

00:03:58.947 --> 00:03:59.989
Die!

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.951
- You--
- What are you doing?

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:04.661
Ah-jin.

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:06.162
Jun-seo.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:07.538
Jun-seo.

00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:10.124
Did you see that?

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.966
I'm still stuck in that hell.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.178
Now you get it.

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:25.890
Ah-jin.

00:04:26.724 --> 00:04:27.725
Ah-jin.

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:30.520
Jun-seo...

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.856
Ah-jin.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.276
Let me drive you home.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:04.721
EPISODE 6: SETTING THE TRAP

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.242
Cut. Great work today.

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.244
- Good job, everyone.
- Good work.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:14.707
Good job.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.417
- Good work.
- Good work, guys.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:18.086
- Thank you, everyone.
- Good work.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.587
- Good job.
- Great job.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.089
- Thank you.
- Great work.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.132
I learned a lot, thanks to you.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.801
Great work today.

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:28.638
Ah-jin.

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.100
Do you have a minute?

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.983
You know I used to be in an idol band

00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:42.527
right?

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.156
There was a member, Ji-hyeok

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.451
who was more popular than me.

00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:53.621
One day at lunch

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:57.875
he ate some macarons
from a fan and got sick.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:02.088
I was rushed in as a substitute host.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.801
The broadcast folks
noticed me that day

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:08.803
and that's how I ended up here.

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:13.349
But...

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:19.272
I knew from the start

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:22.150
that those macarons contained nuts.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.864
I saw him eating them

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:31.242
but kept my mouth shut.

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:35.413
He left the industry
and does something else now.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:40.168
But whenever he sees me on TV,
he sends messages to cheer me on.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.505
Every time he does that, I wonder.

00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:51.053
"Does he know
that I knew and said nothing?

00:07:52.054 --> 00:07:56.767
Is he getting back at me
by texting me

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.604
or does he really wish me well?"

00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:04.275
Whichever it is,
both are hell for me.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.571
What are you trying to say?

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.324
The video at the anniversary party.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:13.284
I enjoyed it.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.460
Watching you claw your way up

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:26.130
reminds me of my younger self,
so here's some advice.

00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:29.634
You're going to do fine without that.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.429
I just don't want you to end up
regretting it like me.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.015
As your senior

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.060
I'll always be rooting for you.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:10.091
NO CALLER ID

00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:15.054
NO CALLER ID

00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:16.597
DECEMBER 25, SATURDAY

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:24.355
NO CALLER ID

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:27.775
Ms. Baek Ah-jin.

00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:30.695
I need you to come here.

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:32.488
How did you get my number?

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.156
It wasn't so hard.

00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:37.368
Anyway, that's not the point.

00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:40.538
We need to finish our talk
from last time.

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.207
I've got nothing to say.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:47.253
Then who should I tell
your secret to?

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:49.297
Ms. Baek.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.508
Are you okay with me
spilling your past

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.678
to whomever I want, huh?

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.433
Fine, send me the address.

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:15.781
Honestly, I don't get it.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.702
All the other groups still hang out
after they disband.

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:20.870
But look at us.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.705
We always meet separately.

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.000
So?

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:27.835
What's your point?

00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:30.963
Frankly, you're the one
I don't get most.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.048
Right.

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.800
It's not like Ji-hyeok ending up
at the ER was your fault.

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:37.136
And you filling in
as a substitute host?

00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:39.305
Dude, that was ages ago.

00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:42.725
You done?

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.645
You're really not going to see him?

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:49.607
He misses you.

00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:51.275
You know that.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.875
Man, this feels good.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.167
Enjoying the view?

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:34.295
What the heck are you doing?

00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:36.172
I thought about it

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:39.133
and I figured I should show you
rather than tell you.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.844
Take a good look.

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.429
That's your future.

00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:46.265
See the kid in the blue hoodie?

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:52.605
Doesn't he look familiar?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.275
When he was a rookie,
his bullying past came out

00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:57.985
so his career died instantly.

00:12:58.068 --> 00:12:59.695
He was finished.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.614
But people already knew his face.

00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:03.866
He was young but had no skills.

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.618
Yet he still wanted to party.

00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:07.244
So, what happens?

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:10.331
He starts bouncing around clubs,
popping whatever he finds.

00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:12.291
Then he ran into me.

00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:16.462
You're next, Ah-jin.

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:20.966
Look forward to it.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:23.552
As much as my life burned down

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.848
your life will also

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:29.809
come to an end.

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:54.667
I hoped I was wrong.

00:13:56.877 --> 00:13:58.379
But it really was you, Ah-jin.

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:08.389
Does Ms. Seo know?

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.101
That you're slipping
in and out of VIP rooms?

00:14:13.894 --> 00:14:16.438
I didn't want to be there.

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.525
Someone called me there.

00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:22.611
So, if someone calls

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:24.780
you go no matter the place?

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.366
Why do you phrase it like that?

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:29.702
No, why do you live like that?

00:14:29.785 --> 00:14:31.078
If you think it's unfair, tell me.

00:14:31.161 --> 00:14:33.706
Who summoned you to that VIP room?

00:14:38.085 --> 00:14:39.712
Of course, you won't say.

00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:41.922
Get out of my car.

00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:49.013
You can go to whoever calls you.

00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:55.477
I said, get out.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.255
Well, well.

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:26.300
Jae-oh is finally working with me.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.594
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:29.887
Nothing.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.890
I heard I'd make good money
if I worked for you.

00:15:34.558 --> 00:15:35.935
Plus, you're human, too.

00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:39.188
There's got to be
something I can learn from you.

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:40.314
What did you say?

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:45.277
I just want to be useful for once.

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:51.575
Anyway, this job.

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.369
It's legit, right?

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.412
It's not illegal or anything?

00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:57.915
You punk. I'm done with that stuff.

00:15:57.998 --> 00:16:01.418
We help people who need it
and get paid fair.

00:16:02.002 --> 00:16:04.380
And you can find anyone
if you work for me.

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:05.464
Even your girl.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.549
Gosh.

00:16:08.008 --> 00:16:09.218
What girl?

00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:11.428
You know, the broom.

00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:14.098
How do you know about the broom?

00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:17.810
That girl with the broom-head hair
you sketched in lockup every day.

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:20.020
I've got eyes, kid.

00:16:20.604 --> 00:16:22.064
I don't need to look for her.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.233
I already know where she is.

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:26.986
What good is knowing
if you can't even meet her?

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:28.237
You never know.

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:30.155
Maybe someday I'll meet her.

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.741
That's why I'm busting my ass now!

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:33.993
Okay, then.

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:37.579
To hardworking Jae-oh,
it's time for your first gig.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:40.791
What is it?

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:48.257
A police officer?

00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:51.552
You said it wasn't illegal!

00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:53.846
He's a substation cop.

00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:56.849
The client wants everything.
Dig up every bit of information

00:16:56.932 --> 00:16:58.934
real or not.

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:04.064
Jeez.

00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:06.734
How do I even find
information on a cop?

00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:11.363
- We need more kimchi.
- Coming right up.

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.118
Ma'am, do you have an empty table?

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:18.746
You'll have to sit with someone else.
Is that okay?

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:19.830
Sure.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.713
Excuse me.

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:39.016
One radish soup, please.

00:17:39.099 --> 00:17:40.100
Sure thing.

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:52.196
Oh, man. I'm so sorry.

00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:53.822
- My bad.
- Be careful.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.824
- I'm really sorry.
- Jeez, never mind.

00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:04.333
Gosh.

00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:09.088
I apologize.

00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:10.172
Forget it.

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.719
- I'll pay now.
- Okay.

00:18:17.387 --> 00:18:19.640
Thank you for coming.
Have a nice day.

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:37.199

Your phone.

00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:58.679
You took mine, right?

00:18:58.762 --> 00:19:00.305
- Yes.
- Here.

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:01.890
They looked exactly the same.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.449
Lieutenant Park Dae-ho?

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.243
I'm here.

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:23.162
- Reporter Lim?
- Yes, nice to meet you.

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:24.246
Hi.

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:25.873
Have a seat.

00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:34.590
One iced Americano, please.

00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:36.300
That will be 4,000 won.

00:19:41.054 --> 00:19:42.806
You know who Baek Ah-jin is, right?

00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:44.850
I know her very well.

00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:48.020
We were really close, she and I.

00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:49.229
Right.

00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:52.024
I can tell from your tone
that you two were close.

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:54.651
- You think so?
- Yes.

00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:58.739
- Who hired you for this?
- What?

00:19:58.822 --> 00:20:00.908
Who hired you
for that background check on the cop?

00:20:04.786 --> 00:20:05.913
- Hello?
- What's this?

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:08.832
"Nojeong-dong rooftop house murder"?
"Baek Ah-jin"?

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.418
Who am I speaking to?

00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:12.878
We need to meet up.

00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:14.171
Who the heck are you?

00:20:14.254 --> 00:20:15.839
Did you forget my voice?

00:20:15.923 --> 00:20:17.007
It's Kim Jae-oh.

00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:22.095
Explain.

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:25.265
Why did Ah-jin's name come up
with a murder case?

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:27.184
- You know something?
- Sit.

00:20:27.517 --> 00:20:28.727
I'll explain.

00:20:31.271 --> 00:20:34.650
She didn't exactly kill him.

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:37.444
But it's not like she didn't, either.

00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:39.613
It makes you curious, right?

00:20:39.696 --> 00:20:42.115
Other reporters found it hilarious.

00:20:43.158 --> 00:20:44.576
You have proof, yes?

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.994
I'm a police officer.

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:49.122
We're going to crush her
for good, right?

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.294
Is this real?

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.380
Did she actually kill--

00:20:56.463 --> 00:20:58.048
No, definitely not.

00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:01.385
Someone else did it,
and he's in prison now.

00:21:01.468 --> 00:21:04.346
A cop tried to frame her back then,
got punished

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:06.181
and has held a grudge ever since.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.683
That cop is

00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:09.226
Park Dae-ho?

00:21:09.685 --> 00:21:10.686
Yes.

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:16.149
So, does that mean
Ah-jin almost got arrested?

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:20.237
What were you doing
while all that happened to her?

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:23.156
There was nothing I could do then.

00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:27.286
Don't tell me
you're also suspecting her.

00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:30.163
She was cleared without a charge

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:32.040
and there hasn't been
a problem since.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:34.626
She'll be in trouble
if the press gets wind of this now.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.920
And that cop is nasty.

00:21:37.212 --> 00:21:38.672
Who knows what he might try?

00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:46.096
I only saw her on TV

00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:48.765
so I thought she was doing fine.

00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:53.312
Tell me what to do.

00:21:54.229 --> 00:21:55.397
I'll help.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.198
How is it going with Lieutenant Park?

00:22:06.074 --> 00:22:07.200
I'm still on it.

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:10.037
I have most of his movements
mapped out.

00:22:11.413 --> 00:22:14.708
He'll go wild
if you poke him carelessly.

00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:16.710
Do it right.

00:22:17.252 --> 00:22:19.463
Don't worry. We've got help.

00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:20.672
Help?

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:21.965
Open the door.

00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:26.428
Open it!

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.388
You'll be glad to see him, too.

00:22:34.561 --> 00:22:36.271
Took you long enough.

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:38.899
Do you know how long I waited
out here because of you?

00:22:38.982 --> 00:22:40.984
I almost froze to death for beer.

00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:43.362
Well, you back now, so say hi.

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:46.073
But it's so late. Say hi to who?

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.459
It's been a long time, Jae-oh.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.465
You scared me.

00:23:10.013 --> 00:23:11.848
I got out last December.

00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:14.768
I served four full years.

00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:17.437
What do you do now?

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.565
Well...

00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:25.112
I just take action
when the office gives me an order.

00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:29.241
Deliveries, transfers, transport...

00:23:29.324 --> 00:23:30.617
All kinds of stuff.

00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:37.499
DIRECT SOLUTION

00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:39.042
And I do background checks.

00:23:40.168 --> 00:23:43.046
And some odd jobs
when there's nothing else.

00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:48.844
Hey.

00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:53.306
I thought you'd ignore me
now that you're a celebrity.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.724
You're pretty loyal.

00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:58.728
Back off.

00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:00.730
No.

00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:06.153
I want a good look at my friend.
What's wrong with that?

00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:09.156
"Friend"?

00:24:10.198 --> 00:24:12.200
Since when were you my friend?

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:15.203
You're right.

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.122
Boss?

00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:22.669
Make time for me sometime.
The boss will buy you dinner.

00:24:22.752 --> 00:24:24.004
Are you for real?

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:27.507
Then I'm asking
for a very expensive meal.

00:24:27.924 --> 00:24:29.134
Like what?

00:24:31.386 --> 00:24:32.512
Trouble pasta.

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:35.557
You mean "truffle," idiot.

00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:37.559
That stuff is crazy expensive.

00:24:38.768 --> 00:24:41.021
- Name it. It's on me.
- More?

00:24:41.104 --> 00:24:42.856
- What else?
- Chuck flap tail?

00:24:42.939 --> 00:24:44.357
Chuck flap tail?

00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:46.067
Burgers, pizza.

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:47.736
- That's what you want?
- Jjajangmyeon.

00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:49.738
- And this.
- What is that?

00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:52.324
- You know, they drop it like this.
- What?

00:25:28.985 --> 00:25:30.070
Get in.

00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:39.454
What's this?

00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:40.664
It's for you.

00:25:41.164 --> 00:25:42.249
It's a burner phone.

00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:44.501
Drive safely, sir!

00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:02.519
Hey.

00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:04.896
Come to think of it

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.274
you didn't want me
to talk to you in school.

00:26:07.983 --> 00:26:09.442
Didn't you hate me back then?

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:11.736
I still do.

00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:19.202
Then why did you let me see her?

00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:23.331
Don't you like Ah-jin?

00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:27.002
Does it look like it?

00:26:28.044 --> 00:26:29.671
Wow, you're serious.

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:31.256
That pisses me off.

00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:34.718
I just want her to live
an ordinary life.

00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:36.886
That's why I need you.

00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:41.099
Because she's more likely to live
a normal life

00:26:42.017 --> 00:26:45.478
through you, rather than me.

00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:49.149
What are you talking about?

00:26:49.733 --> 00:26:51.901
Make it simple for me to understand.

00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:53.737
Didn't you see her smile earlier?

00:26:55.071 --> 00:26:57.282
She rarely smiles like that.

00:27:07.334 --> 00:27:08.752
How does she usually smile?

00:27:19.763 --> 00:27:21.765
Hi everyone, I'm Baek Ah-jin.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.770
Today is my first shoot with Dazy.

00:27:26.853 --> 00:27:29.606
Fashionable and trendy style...

00:27:41.868 --> 00:27:43.995
He didn't stand out at first.

00:27:44.454 --> 00:27:47.540
But he took off after being
a substitute host on a music show.

00:27:47.624 --> 00:27:48.625
HEO IN-GANG WINS AT BLUEDRAGON AWARDS

00:27:48.708 --> 00:27:51.419
Then he switched to acting,
met Longstar's CEO, Seo Mi-ri

00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:52.671
and became a star.

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:55.131
Maybe because
he's been working nonstop

00:27:55.215 --> 00:27:58.510
he's dealing with depression,
panic disorder, and maybe alcoholism.

00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:04.557
He still feels guilty about that
substitute host gig from years ago.

00:28:06.309 --> 00:28:08.311
He must think he's being punished.

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:11.648
Both his parents died
when he was little.

00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:14.651
His dad died in a car accident
when he was eight.

00:28:14.734 --> 00:28:16.319
A year later,
on his dad's memorial day

00:28:16.403 --> 00:28:17.612
his mom took her own life.

00:28:18.071 --> 00:28:21.116
He and his younger brother were
raised by their maternal grandmother.

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:22.659
I LOVE YOU, GRANDMA
I MISS YOU

00:28:23.076 --> 00:28:25.120
He's still really close to her.

00:28:26.746 --> 00:28:29.332
He always goes to his grandma's
on days off.

00:28:31.084 --> 00:28:34.254
No matter how tired he is,
he always answers her calls.

00:28:37.757 --> 00:28:39.134
Kitty.

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:41.219
Why did you come alone?

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.346
It's well-known among his fans.

00:28:44.597 --> 00:28:46.474
For In-gang, his grandma is

00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:48.268
the only real anchor.

00:28:50.103 --> 00:28:52.397

VISIT EUNGWAN TEMPLE
ON THE DAY OF THE FULL MOON

00:29:24.471 --> 00:29:26.514
THE SPIRIT OF THE LATE LIM SUN-YE

00:29:58.087 --> 00:30:00.924
I've never seen anyone
come alone to perform memorial rites.

00:30:01.007 --> 00:30:02.383
Maybe she has no family.

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:04.761
I heard she's an actress.

00:30:04.844 --> 00:30:06.805
- An up-and-comer, they say.
- Yes.

00:30:06.888 --> 00:30:09.224
She's mostly in films,
so we wouldn't know.

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:10.600
I see.

00:30:13.102 --> 00:30:15.104
Yesterday's move
must have been rough.

00:30:15.188 --> 00:30:17.732
Yes, I haven't even
finished unpacking.

00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:19.651
Thanks for finding me the place.

00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:21.903
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:23.947
It's close to the office
and super nice.

00:30:26.032 --> 00:30:28.034
Tell me if you need anything else.

00:30:28.117 --> 00:30:30.328
I'll bring it as a housewarming gift.

00:30:31.955 --> 00:30:35.166
JINSIU RICE CAKE

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:45.009
Hey, Ah-jin.

00:30:45.927 --> 00:30:47.262
Goodness.

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:48.513
Wait.

00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:49.931
What's all this?

00:30:50.348 --> 00:30:51.516
Sorry.

00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:55.728
I ordered by text when I was busy
and typed the wrong number.

00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.940
This is a four-story building.
I'll give these out on the top floor.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:03.903
Promise me you won't tell Ms. Seo.

00:31:04.445 --> 00:31:06.281
I promise. Let's go inside.

00:31:09.242 --> 00:31:14.914
HOME: UNIT 401, BUILDING B,
K APARTMENT, YEONDU-DONG

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.521
Hello.

00:31:38.605 --> 00:31:41.733
I just moved in downstairs
and brought some rice cakes.

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:43.735
Oh, my. Thank you.

00:31:44.235 --> 00:31:46.571
What a sweet young lady.

00:31:47.155 --> 00:31:49.490
Not at all. I hope you enjoy them.

00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:54.621
Did you happen to visit
Eungwan Temple not long ago?

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:57.248
Yes, I did.

00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:59.459
What a nice surprise.

00:31:59.542 --> 00:32:00.877
We meet again.

00:32:02.045 --> 00:32:03.296
Do you live here?

00:32:03.379 --> 00:32:05.965
No, a friend of mine just moved in.

00:32:09.469 --> 00:32:12.513
Do you have time?

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:15.934
Today's the day my daughter visits

00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:18.937
so I cooked way too much.

00:32:19.896 --> 00:32:23.983
If it's not a bother,
would you come in for a quick meal?

00:32:29.405 --> 00:32:30.573
Yes, Grandma.

00:32:30.657 --> 00:32:31.991
I'm on my way now.

00:32:33.034 --> 00:32:34.702
Aunt might be late.

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:36.454
Did you cook a feast again?

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:40.959
I told you not to wear yourself out.

00:32:43.711 --> 00:32:44.712
What?

00:32:45.046 --> 00:32:47.006
Who's at your place?

00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:56.891
It's my daughter's memorial today.

00:32:59.227 --> 00:33:01.562
She was in such a hurry
to leave this world

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.564
that she went before me.

00:33:04.607 --> 00:33:06.567
It's the one day in a year she comes

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:10.113
so I made all her favorite dishes

00:33:10.196 --> 00:33:12.031
and I overdid it again.

00:33:12.115 --> 00:33:13.616
Oh, dear.

00:33:14.367 --> 00:33:15.660
Thank you for the food.

00:33:17.537 --> 00:33:18.705
Help yourself.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.221
What's wrong?

00:33:35.304 --> 00:33:37.265
There's nothing you like?

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:57.035
Ah-jin.

00:33:58.661 --> 00:33:59.704
Step outside.

00:33:59.787 --> 00:34:01.080
In-gang, what are you doing?

00:34:01.164 --> 00:34:02.457
Don't be rude to a guest.

00:34:08.963 --> 00:34:10.256
Get up.

00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:18.848
In-gang!

00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:32.236
What's this?

00:34:33.196 --> 00:34:35.239
Is this really
the kind of person you are?

00:34:36.824 --> 00:34:37.992
In-gang.

00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:40.328
There's been a misunderstanding.

00:34:40.411 --> 00:34:42.371
- She and I met by chance--
- By chance?

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:46.501
You're unbelievable.

00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:51.380
What did I do wrong?

00:34:52.465 --> 00:34:54.801
I don't see why you're so angry.

00:34:54.884 --> 00:34:55.885
You seriously don't?

00:34:57.345 --> 00:34:58.471
Then explain it.

00:35:00.723 --> 00:35:04.143
Why are you in my grandma's house,
and with what intention?

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.903
Hyang-i moved in here.

00:35:14.987 --> 00:35:17.365
I came to help her
hand out rice cakes

00:35:17.698 --> 00:35:19.117
and ended up going inside.

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:22.245
I had no idea
it was your grandma's place.

00:35:24.372 --> 00:35:25.873
Do I need to explain more?

00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:28.376
So, you didn't know?

00:35:30.169 --> 00:35:31.796
All of this was a coincidence?

00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:35.383
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm sorry

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.886
but your grandma invited me first.

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:41.681
She said she cooked a lot
for her daughter's memorial

00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:42.849
and asked me to join.

00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:44.851
How could I say no?

00:35:45.893 --> 00:35:48.146
I guess you don't care
about her opinion at all.

00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:49.897
I don't want to hear anymore. Go.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.024
Leave.

00:35:56.362 --> 00:35:58.156
At least one thing's clear.

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:02.827
You're still haunted.

00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:07.290
What?

00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:11.794
The advice you gave me last time.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.923
You told me to stop torturing myself.

00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:21.971
But you're the one tightening
the noose around your neck.

00:36:25.308 --> 00:36:27.727
The one who's overstepping
and tormenting me

00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:30.271
is you.

00:36:34.108 --> 00:36:36.903
Then what did you mean
when you said that to me?

00:36:38.321 --> 00:36:42.783
You exposed your flaws
to give me advice

00:36:43.242 --> 00:36:44.702
so I mistook it for something more.

00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:48.539
Why would you push me away like that?

00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:50.416
I guess...

00:36:51.417 --> 00:36:53.669
that's how you've lived
your whole life.

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:00.259
Are you saying I'm the one at fault?

00:37:03.679 --> 00:37:05.765
Do you know
what people say about you?

00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:09.518
That you'll die soon.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.606
That you look lonely and on edge.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.069
They act concerned behind your back

00:37:18.152 --> 00:37:19.737
but no one has the guts to tell you.

00:37:21.322 --> 00:37:22.406
But I...

00:37:24.617 --> 00:37:26.535
genuinely worry about you.

00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:31.290
You look unstable,
so I can't pretend I don't see it.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:37.213
I didn't ask you to.

00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:41.634
Don't show up in front of me again.

00:37:45.554 --> 00:37:46.806
I really liked you...

00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:50.810
as a person

00:37:50.893 --> 00:37:52.395
and respected you as an actor.

00:37:55.731 --> 00:37:57.191
I guess I was wrong.

00:37:59.986 --> 00:38:01.654
You're nothing but a coward.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:15.126
Anyway, I'm sorry
for causing a misunderstanding.

00:38:15.209 --> 00:38:16.335
That's on me.

00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:19.755
I apologize.

00:38:42.695 --> 00:38:45.156
Isn't it time you told me your plan?

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.200
What are you trying to do
with Heo In-gang?

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:49.702
Jun-seo.

00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:53.205
I told you. I'm going to date him.

00:38:58.753 --> 00:39:01.797
I thought I've done enough
for two years, but I was wrong.

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.052
You know

00:39:07.094 --> 00:39:09.180
how anxious I am right now.

00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:18.189
And Heo In-gang is

00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:22.109
just a step that I need
in my current situation.

00:39:22.651 --> 00:39:25.279
A lovely set of steps

00:39:25.654 --> 00:39:27.323
that will help me get to the top.

00:39:45.132 --> 00:39:47.093
THE SPIRITS OF THE LATE
MS. KIM AND MR. HEO

00:40:57.663 --> 00:40:59.498
I told you not to let
just anyone in here.

00:40:59.582 --> 00:41:01.083
Why don't you ever listen?

00:41:01.167 --> 00:41:02.460
She was my guest.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.253
Even if I'm old

00:41:04.336 --> 00:41:07.256
I can still tell
who's approaching me with a purpose.

00:41:07.339 --> 00:41:09.175
You made a big mistake today.

00:41:09.508 --> 00:41:11.969
Apologize when you see
that young lady again.

00:41:12.052 --> 00:41:13.095
You're wrong.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.599
There are so many dangerous people
in this line of work.

00:41:17.183 --> 00:41:18.350
You have no idea.

00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:20.478
You know what?

00:41:20.853 --> 00:41:22.813
Heo In-gang blew up at me today.

00:41:23.522 --> 00:41:27.026
He grilled me about whether
I approached his grandma on purpose.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.825
To be honest, it was annoying.

00:41:35.951 --> 00:41:38.412
My original plan was
to meet his grandma only.

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:42.917
I lost my temper
and said whatever came to mind

00:41:43.584 --> 00:41:45.377
and his face changed.

00:41:46.128 --> 00:41:47.463
I wonder

00:41:47.546 --> 00:41:48.923
which part of what I said

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.426
touched his heart.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.388
Did it make him sad

00:41:57.765 --> 00:41:59.058
or surprised?

00:42:03.562 --> 00:42:06.065
Grandma, I'm heading out.

00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:11.946
Take this with you.

00:42:14.949 --> 00:42:18.911
I should have put myself
in your shoes.

00:42:19.245 --> 00:42:20.287
I'm sorry.

00:42:20.996 --> 00:42:24.875
But you can't go through life
being too calculating

00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:27.253
and pushing people away.

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:29.129
Well, you know...

00:42:30.172 --> 00:42:32.049
I'm at the end of the road

00:42:32.508 --> 00:42:35.970
but you kids have a long way to go.

00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:37.638
In the end

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:39.765
you'll have to lean on other people.

00:42:44.979 --> 00:42:45.980
Just

00:42:46.772 --> 00:42:49.817
listen to your heart and follow it.

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:55.239
I will.

00:43:33.485 --> 00:43:34.862
Today was a win.

00:43:35.988 --> 00:43:40.200
I'll find out how he reacts
tomorrow or the next day.

00:43:41.994 --> 00:43:43.162
I can't wait.

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:50.127
Ah-jin.

00:43:52.546 --> 00:43:54.214
Don't worry, Jun-seo.

00:43:54.673 --> 00:43:56.467
I'll date him for exactly a year.

00:43:57.551 --> 00:43:58.969
That's all I need.

00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:17.905
GEUMHWADANG BAKERY CAFÉ

00:44:24.536 --> 00:44:28.374
Director Sung suggested
that we meet here, so I said okay.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:31.543
Are you sure you're fine?

00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:33.837
I'm fine. Who cares?

00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:42.429
- We'll meet again next time.
- Sure.

00:44:43.055 --> 00:44:44.056
Take care.

00:44:44.932 --> 00:44:45.974
In-gang.

00:44:49.144 --> 00:44:53.190
I booked Geumhwadang like you asked

00:44:54.024 --> 00:44:55.818
but I'm not sure about this.

00:44:55.901 --> 00:44:57.111
Thanks for your work.

00:44:57.528 --> 00:44:59.238
Anyway, I did as you asked.

00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:02.574
Even if anything goes wrong,
leave me out of it.

00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:05.703
I'll handle whatever comes.

00:45:05.786 --> 00:45:07.579
Don't you worry.

00:45:28.308 --> 00:45:29.685
This is our new dessert.

00:45:29.768 --> 00:45:30.811
Try it.

00:45:36.942 --> 00:45:39.069
It took a lot of trial and error
to nail the taste.

00:45:39.153 --> 00:45:40.946
It reminded me of our trainee days.

00:45:41.029 --> 00:45:43.574
I thought being an idol singer
was the toughest job back then

00:45:43.657 --> 00:45:45.284
but once I lived another life

00:45:45.784 --> 00:45:47.619
I realized that nothing was easy.

00:45:48.495 --> 00:45:50.706
- Are you doing well?
- Of course.

00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:53.751
That's why I came to see you.

00:45:54.293 --> 00:45:55.669
And I had something to say.

00:45:57.379 --> 00:45:59.631
I actually knew it back then.

00:46:01.383 --> 00:46:03.719
That the macarons had nuts inside.

00:46:05.679 --> 00:46:08.557
And I knew you saw it
and said nothing.

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:10.934
But you know what?

00:46:11.727 --> 00:46:13.854
I ate them on purpose
from the first place.

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:16.732
Because I was living in hell.

00:46:18.776 --> 00:46:22.905
The music on stage
made it hard to breathe.

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:26.366
I felt like I'd die if I didn't quit.

00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:28.118
So, I ate them

00:46:28.786 --> 00:46:31.121
knowing they had nuts in them.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:35.709
So, stop carrying guilt
about stepping in

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:38.712
as a substitute host that day.

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:42.925
Is this some sudden confession?

00:46:44.009 --> 00:46:47.095
I knew my messages
would make you suffer.

00:46:47.513 --> 00:46:49.681
So, I'm sorry
for sending them anyway.

00:46:50.724 --> 00:46:52.392
I'm getting married soon.

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:54.311
I'm more at peace than ever.

00:46:55.354 --> 00:46:56.355
Maybe it's time...

00:46:57.898 --> 00:46:59.483
you let go.

00:47:04.154 --> 00:47:05.197
No, In-gang.

00:47:06.156 --> 00:47:07.199
Calm down.

00:47:18.293 --> 00:47:19.670
Was her name Baek Ah-jin?

00:47:20.087 --> 00:47:21.630
She came to see me.

00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:23.423
I don't know how she knew

00:47:24.258 --> 00:47:25.759
but she asked about back then.

00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:29.721
"Does he know
that I knew and said nothing?

00:47:29.805 --> 00:47:32.808
Is he getting back at me
by texting me

00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:35.686
or does he really wish me well?"

00:47:35.769 --> 00:47:38.564
Whichever it is,
both are hell for me.

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:42.359
So, I told her,
and she asked me for help.

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:45.696
She said you were tormented
and that she wanted my help.

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:47.739
She seemed like a good person.

00:47:47.823 --> 00:47:49.491
It also looked
like she really cared for you.

00:47:53.078 --> 00:47:54.079
I'm sorry.

00:48:08.343 --> 00:48:09.469
In-gang, what's wrong?

00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:17.978
I went to the awards and shot a drama
with her because you asked

00:48:18.312 --> 00:48:20.355
but I don't want to be involved
with Baek Ah-jin anymore.

00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:24.067
You never complained,
whatever the gig was.

00:48:24.651 --> 00:48:26.445
But this one bothers you?

00:48:27.696 --> 00:48:28.697
Why?

00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:30.574
Did she make a mistake?

00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:34.036
Somehow, she keeps overstepping.
It makes me uncomfortable.

00:48:34.119 --> 00:48:36.788
And I broke up with Lena for good,
so put out the breakup news soon.

00:48:38.624 --> 00:48:39.666
Got it.

00:48:40.876 --> 00:48:41.960
Thanks.

00:48:42.044 --> 00:48:44.046
No need to thank me. That's a given.

00:48:53.096 --> 00:48:55.265
Actors Heo In-gang and Lena
have ended

00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:57.768
their public relationship
after a year.

00:48:57.851 --> 00:49:00.562
Their agency, Longstar Entertainment

00:49:00.854 --> 00:49:03.857
said their busy schedules
created distance

00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:07.235
and they decided to return
to being colleagues.

00:49:07.319 --> 00:49:09.780
Many fans are disappointed

00:49:09.863 --> 00:49:12.115
as the two were seen
as a great match.

00:49:13.742 --> 00:49:15.035
What are you doing?

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:17.829
Are you even looking into it?
Why is it taking so long?

00:49:19.331 --> 00:49:21.500
And stop whining!

00:49:24.002 --> 00:49:25.754
Don't you realize
the monthly support I give you

00:49:25.837 --> 00:49:27.297
is more than your salary?

00:49:27.381 --> 00:49:29.841
Do your job right before I fire you.

00:49:30.842 --> 00:49:32.135
Damn it.

00:49:33.595 --> 00:49:34.596
That bitch...

00:49:35.847 --> 00:49:36.974
Goddamn it!

00:49:47.526 --> 00:49:48.568
It's me.

00:49:49.027 --> 00:49:51.154
The materials we discussed are ready.

00:49:51.738 --> 00:49:53.865
Can we meet where we did last time?

00:49:53.949 --> 00:49:54.950
In about an hour.

00:49:55.867 --> 00:49:56.868
Okay.

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.385
Gosh.

00:50:15.637 --> 00:50:17.097
You're that guy from before.

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.223
So what?

00:50:18.306 --> 00:50:20.434
- Happy to see me?
- Yeah, sure.

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:23.729
How dare you do this
in broad daylight--

00:50:24.938 --> 00:50:28.442
You took bribes to bury a case
when you were on the narcotics squad.

00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:31.528
My life's already in the gutter!

00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:33.613
But it's a different story
with a celebrity.

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:37.617
One word from me, and Baek Ah-jin
will disappear without a--

00:50:40.162 --> 00:50:43.290
Your daughter
did drugs in the States.

00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:47.669
Try burying that one, too.

00:50:47.753 --> 00:50:49.546
PERSONAL DETAILS

00:50:51.757 --> 00:50:53.300
PARK DAE-HO

00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:58.096
The suspicions about Baek Ah-jin

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.098
in the Nojeong-dong murder case
aren't true.

00:51:00.182 --> 00:51:01.641
There's no file.

00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:04.811
The person you've called
can't be reached--

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:06.271
Shit.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.648
She probably got to him first.

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:09.941
I told you so.

00:51:10.025 --> 00:51:12.027
She's not an easy target.

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.403
This won't be simple.

00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:16.073
That's what amateurs say.

00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:18.867
I wire you ten million won
every month

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:21.912
but all you do is
leave a few comments on my articles.

00:51:21.995 --> 00:51:23.455
Aren't you taking it a bit too far?

00:51:23.538 --> 00:51:26.500
Don't get touchy
about hearing this from your cousin.

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:28.794
It's not a small amount
to let pride get in the way.

00:51:30.128 --> 00:51:33.507
Also, don't you dare
whine in front of me again.

00:51:34.716 --> 00:51:36.051
Earn

00:51:37.177 --> 00:51:38.345
what you're paid.

00:51:39.638 --> 00:51:41.598
That reporter
Lieutenant Park was trying to contact

00:51:42.849 --> 00:51:44.684
only writes hit pieces on Boss.

00:51:46.561 --> 00:51:47.604
Lim Hee-kook?

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:49.439
Yes, that's his name.

00:51:49.523 --> 00:51:52.943
He writes nothing but good things
about Lena or something.

00:51:53.026 --> 00:51:55.695
It turns out they're related.

00:51:57.656 --> 00:51:59.741
I'll talk to Lena.

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:02.661
What?

00:52:03.245 --> 00:52:04.663
You know her?

00:52:04.746 --> 00:52:07.290
I hear she's been bullying Ah-jin.

00:52:07.374 --> 00:52:08.375
What?

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:10.794
Jeez, she's unhinged.

00:52:10.877 --> 00:52:13.171
Why keep poking Ah-jin
when she's done nothing?

00:52:15.924 --> 00:52:18.885
By the way,
Ah-jin says she'll date him.

00:52:19.719 --> 00:52:20.720
Is that true?

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:22.514
That's her next move.

00:52:22.597 --> 00:52:24.349
I thought you two were
into each other.

00:52:30.397 --> 00:52:31.773
You're pathetic.

00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:33.233
If I were you...

00:52:36.361 --> 00:52:37.362
You know what?

00:52:38.572 --> 00:52:39.614
Forget it.

00:52:43.243 --> 00:52:44.786
Man.

00:52:53.795 --> 00:52:55.213
Oh, how did you...

00:52:56.131 --> 00:52:59.843
I couldn't get you off my mind
after that night.

00:53:00.719 --> 00:53:02.012
Take a seat.

00:53:06.183 --> 00:53:08.101
I should have come to you first.

00:53:08.185 --> 00:53:09.853
I wanted to apologize.

00:53:11.062 --> 00:53:13.273
And to see you again.

00:53:14.316 --> 00:53:15.650
I'm sorry.

00:53:15.734 --> 00:53:17.819
My boy has been hurt before.

00:53:18.153 --> 00:53:21.364
I told him not to do that.

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.033
Please don't hold it against him.

00:53:24.951 --> 00:53:26.786
He lost his parents in his childhood

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.164
and I raised him.

00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:31.208
Yes, I know.

00:53:34.169 --> 00:53:35.420
I understand.

00:53:36.129 --> 00:53:40.342
I also lost my parents
when I was little.

00:53:40.759 --> 00:53:43.261
Oh, I see.

00:53:45.597 --> 00:53:49.392
But can I ask you something?

00:53:49.768 --> 00:53:51.061
Of course.

00:53:51.436 --> 00:53:54.272
Why did you cry that night?

00:53:58.526 --> 00:54:02.697
Because it reminded me
of my late mom.

00:54:03.823 --> 00:54:08.161
She used to love spring greens.

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:10.455
MY DAUGHTER EUN-A'S FAVORITE FOOD
SPRING GREENS, FRESH KIMCHI...

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:16.253
Sorry, I can't stop myself.

00:54:17.045 --> 00:54:19.130
Please don't worry
about what happened.

00:54:33.186 --> 00:54:34.688
Don't worry, Jun-seo.

00:54:35.647 --> 00:54:37.524
I'll date him for exactly a year.

00:54:38.775 --> 00:54:40.151
Don't go.

00:54:47.284 --> 00:54:48.660
Just stay with me.

00:54:50.537 --> 00:54:52.205
That's all I need.

00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:10.390
Do you know
what people say about you?

00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:12.267
That you'll die soon.

00:55:19.524 --> 00:55:21.276
That you look lonely and on edge.

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:24.029
I genuinely worry about you.

00:55:24.571 --> 00:55:25.989
I didn't ask you to.

00:55:26.698 --> 00:55:28.074
I really liked you

00:55:28.491 --> 00:55:30.452
as a person

00:55:30.535 --> 00:55:31.870
and respected you as an actor.

00:55:31.953 --> 00:55:33.371
I guess I was wrong.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.503
You're nothing but a coward.

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:50.805
You'll stay with me, right?

00:55:53.683 --> 00:55:55.727
Don't ever leave me again.

00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:12.827
I'm sorry about the other day.

00:56:12.911 --> 00:56:14.746
How about dinner tonight?

00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:25.965
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER DAY
HOW ABOUT DINNER TONIGHT?

00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:43.733
I'll be free around nine o'clock.

00:56:43.817 --> 00:56:45.151
How about Pavilion?

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:55.078
No way.

00:56:56.371 --> 00:56:57.414
It's Ah-jin.

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.382
Gosh.

00:57:07.465 --> 00:57:11.261
Kim Jae-oh is a big shot now,
visiting a celebrity's place.

00:57:16.182 --> 00:57:17.392
What's with the suit?

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:19.436
Where were you?

00:57:19.853 --> 00:57:22.021
My brother's graduation.

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:26.359
Shouldn't you be eating with him
instead of coming here?

00:57:27.652 --> 00:57:29.070
I wish I could

00:57:30.488 --> 00:57:31.948
but he won't see me.

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.201
Well...

00:57:37.328 --> 00:57:38.329
I get it, though.

00:57:39.164 --> 00:57:40.165
Why?

00:57:40.999 --> 00:57:42.333
Because you're a murderer?

00:57:48.047 --> 00:57:49.257
Your brother is an idiot.

00:57:49.716 --> 00:57:52.010
I would have kept you close.

00:57:52.677 --> 00:57:53.761
Am I wrong?

00:57:54.262 --> 00:57:55.889
A brother who would do
anything for me.

00:57:56.222 --> 00:57:57.682
I'd stick with him for life.

00:57:58.308 --> 00:57:59.851
Your brother's a fool.

00:58:05.607 --> 00:58:08.818
You're definitely something else.

00:58:08.902 --> 00:58:09.903
You really are.

00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:14.574
But for the record,
he's smart as hell.

00:58:14.949 --> 00:58:16.659
His grades are amazing.

00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:19.162
He's nothing like me.

00:58:24.918 --> 00:58:25.919
So, why am I here?

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:27.712
What's up?

00:58:27.795 --> 00:58:29.130
Jae-oh.

00:58:29.214 --> 00:58:30.840
Can I ask you a favor?

00:58:31.466 --> 00:58:33.927
Of course, anything for you.

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:12.692
Shit.

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:16.779
Who turns the wheel like that
out of nowhere?

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:18.573
Are you okay?

01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:21.993
Call Longstar, and they'll handle it.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

01:00:22.076 --> 01:00:23.161
Hold up.

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:24.996
You're a celebrity.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.875
You are. Right, you're Heo...

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.168
Heo.

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:31.794
Gosh.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:34.213
I've never met a celeb in real life.

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:36.758
I thought you'd be crazy handsome.

01:00:38.092 --> 01:00:39.302
Not so impressive, though.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.973
Your tire's blown.

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:46.684
Wait, wow.

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:49.604
Jeez, this is bad.

01:00:52.398 --> 01:00:56.027
Anyway, it looks
like I'm partly at fault.

01:00:58.112 --> 01:00:59.822
Even my phone's cracked.

01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:03.201
Let me borrow your phone
to call the insurance.

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:05.828
No, it's fine. I'm late.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:06.996
Stop.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:08.790
Where do you think you're going?

01:01:08.873 --> 01:01:12.085
You're going to call the police
and say I'm a hit-and-run, right?

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.628
I won't.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.505
And I won't charge you
for the repair.

01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:16.923
You can just go.

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:22.053
Stall him as long as you can.

01:01:22.136 --> 01:01:23.763
Whatever it takes.

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:26.766
Just make sure
he's late to the restaurant.

01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:47.870
Come on. Just let me use your phone.

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:49.080
Jeez.

01:01:56.504 --> 01:01:57.755
I didn't do it.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:01.467
I was just holding it,
and you knocked it out.

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.760
- Got it?
- Seriously.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.723
What do we do now?

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:08.224
Shoot.

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:31.038
What's gotten into you?

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:34.250
You called me first.

01:02:36.544 --> 01:02:38.254
I figured you could use a friend.

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:42.133
You don't strike me
as someone with a big circle.

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:46.429
What's the truth

01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:48.473
with you and Ah-jin?

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:50.349
Be honest.

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:53.311
When we were kids

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:56.606
our parents remarried

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.109
and we lived together briefly.
She's my younger sister.

01:03:01.819 --> 01:03:02.945
"Oh, I see.

01:03:03.696 --> 01:03:05.656
She was your sister."

01:03:06.407 --> 01:03:07.950
Did you expect me to say that?

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:09.952
Please.

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:14.457
That's not how a man looks
at his little sister.

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:19.337
You got me.

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:21.756
Darn.

01:03:24.717 --> 01:03:25.968
So, it's love, huh?

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.767
Sir, I'll get off here.

01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:22.358
Ma'am, we close at ten o'clock.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:23.860
Okay.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.616
Isn't that Baek Ah-jin?

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:15.578
Man, her face and body are unreal.

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:17.788
She's the pure and glamorous type.

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:20.583
No wonder guys go crazy.

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:22.793
With a body like that

01:05:22.877 --> 01:05:25.963
shouldn't she dress lighter
for the people?

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:28.466
Spend the night with me, girl.

01:05:29.133 --> 01:05:30.134
Wait, who are--

01:05:33.679 --> 01:05:34.764
In-gang.

01:05:38.976 --> 01:05:40.061
You piece of--

01:05:44.982 --> 01:05:46.734
Come here. Let go.

01:05:46.817 --> 01:05:48.361
Fucking let me go!

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:49.487
Come here.

01:06:01.165 --> 01:06:02.875
Hey.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:04.710
Move, hey!

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.754
- Get lost!
- What?

01:06:06.837 --> 01:06:09.590
Get out of here!

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:12.051
You two are lunatics.

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:16.138
Jun-seo, are you okay?

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:19.183
Jun-seo, wake up.

01:06:19.433 --> 01:06:21.310
Have you been waiting
this whole time?

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.188
I couldn't reach you,
and I was worried.

01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:25.898
I couldn't just leave.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.566
I'm sorry.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.485
I got into a minor accident
on the way.

01:06:29.568 --> 01:06:31.862
My phone fell into a sewage

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:33.781
and I couldn't remember your number.

01:06:33.864 --> 01:06:36.575
You should have gone home
if you couldn't reach me.

01:06:36.909 --> 01:06:38.744
You waited for me
in this freezing weather?

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:41.497
I didn't want to miss you.

01:06:42.206 --> 01:06:43.708
You're here now, so it's fine.

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:50.673
By the way,
why are you dressed so lightly?

01:06:51.465 --> 01:06:52.591
Aren't you cold?

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:02.810
Wear a scarf next time.

01:07:02.893 --> 01:07:06.439
I know it's stuffy,
but it keeps you warm.

01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:12.278
Am I nagging?

01:07:14.321 --> 01:07:16.282
Is this too much?

01:07:38.345 --> 01:07:39.722
Yoon Jun-seo!

01:07:44.685 --> 01:07:47.563
You missed me, didn't you?

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.556
Hi, I'm Baek Ah-jin.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.100
I'm Yoon Jun-seo.

01:08:36.195 --> 01:08:38.614
Jun-seo, help me.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.493
I'm always on your side.

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.209
Help me.

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:57.383
I want to learn to love him.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:39.341
DEAR X

01:11:58.897 --> 01:12:00.899
