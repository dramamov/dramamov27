[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.940
[Episode 16]

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.880
Who dares to hurt Su Wuming?

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:59.440
Su Wuming!

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.700
Are you hurt?

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.710
No.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.420
Madam Yingtao,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.400
you're truly my protector.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.530
Husband!

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.380
Husband!

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.079
Master!

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.470
-Official Lu!
-Official Lu!

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.220
Please step back.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.220
I'll catch the criminals for you!

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.800
Lu Lingfeng!

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.900
What happened?

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.480
Why are so many people dead?

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.210
Master Fei,

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.870
quickly treat his wounds!

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:41.560
-Hurry!
-Come on.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.390
Help him up.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.800
Bring him there.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.079
Fei,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.220
Lu Lingfeng is in your hands now.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.030
Don't worry.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.400
Come.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.060
With me here, he won't die!

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.810
Hold on.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.400
How dare you hurt my husband?

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.400
Yingtao,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.000
watch out for hidden weapon!

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.690
Using hidden weapons against me?

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.560
Zi!

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.800
Zi!

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.120
Mother!

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.360
Zi!

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.960
Mother!

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.520
Zi!

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.930
Daughter!

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.590
Daughter!

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.280
Huo Jing!

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.210
Daughter!

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.079
Daughter!

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.960
Daughter!

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.630
Huo Jing.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.470
Huo Jing!

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.960
Huo Jing!

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.630
Huo Jing!

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.590
Daughter!

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.250
You killed my wife and daughter!

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.600
None of you will live!

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.340
What is this thing?

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.990
I don't know either!

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.660
Deer antlers

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.850
and a tiger head.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.570
Could it be Bai Ze?

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.410
It can't be.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.310
Bai Ze is an auspicious beast.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.870
It shouldn't look this fierce.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.050
It is Bai Ze!

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.750
The so-called auspicious beast

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.250
is just a fabrication.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.620
This beast is raised by me.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.730
It's my mount.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.380
His Majesty likes it,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.159
so I'll let it into Chang'an

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.010
to feast as it pleases!

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.070
Fei!

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.430
Spear!

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.160
What?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.600
Give me the spear!

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.060
This is definitely not Bai Ze.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.610
This scholar

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.440
is as weak as a kitten.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.910
Leave him to me later.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.670
I'll smoke him into jerky

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.250
to feed my mount.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.330
The mummy!

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.640
This is Ao Tian.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.160
It resembles Bai Ze
but is a ferocious beast.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.620
It likes to eat dried meat.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.890
Fei,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.800
come with me quickly to carry the mummy.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.390
Wait!

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.120
It likes dried meat?

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.940
Well...

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.390
Would beef jerky work?

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.190
I just bought it at the West Market.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.450
I was planning to share it with everyone.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.710
This should work too.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.659
Fei,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.370
I'll leave it to you.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.570
Alright.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.159
Jia, Luo,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.940
help me get on the roof!

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.000
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.470
Lu Lingfeng!

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.190
Lu Lingfeng!

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.270
Lure it over here.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.020
Don't eat it!

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.300
Don't eat it!

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.410
It's poisoned.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.200
You can't eat it!

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.220
Bite off those people's heads!

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.200
Don't eat it!

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:10.790
No!

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.790
Ah!

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.380
Stop!

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.780
Stop now!

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:27.910
Stop immediately!

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:28.820
Stop!

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.150
Stop right now!

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:37.910
[Bai Ze Temple]

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.740
Let me see.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.750
Lu Lingfeng,

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.700
who hurt you?

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.840
Was it this female regimental commander?

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.570
She doesn't seem that skilled.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:56.670
Could it be

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.960
she used her feminine charms?

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.160
Don't talk nonsense.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.670
Tie her up.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.600
Take her back for questioning.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.920
You want to capture me

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.000
to claim credit before that Emperor

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.310
surnamed Li?

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.390
Dream on.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.940
This sword

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.520
was a birthday gift

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.150
she gave me when I was 14.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.360
She gave me my life.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.210
Now, I'm giving it back to her.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.390
Hey, don't!

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.000
Don't!

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.720
Though your crimes are unforgivable,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.910
I have one thing

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.270
to ask you.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.710
Does the Princess know about...

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.600
your actions today?

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.200
You'll never know.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.520
Lu Lingfeng,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.100
could you please ask the Princess

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.960
to bury me on the Hongdu Plain

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.120
next to Shangguan Zhaorong's tomb?

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.880
If possible,

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.750
I need no epitaph,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.480
just a simple stone

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:08.940
inscribed with

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.000
the words "Daughter of Shangguan Wan'er."

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.530
That would be enough for me.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:22.480
Mother.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.150
I'm coming.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.730
[Bai Ze Temple]

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.550
Put me down.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.730
Master, we're not tired.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.230
I said put me down.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.380
Careful, slowly.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.420
Here, slowly.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:26.510
Gently.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.740
Do you know what I'm thinking?

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.000
To walk in the last rays of sunset

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.840
and retreat far into the mountains.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.080
The one who knows me

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.840
is Lu Lingfeng.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.680
We are senior
and junior brothers, after all.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.880
All these years solving cases together,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.550
we've become like family.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.720
Get to the point.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.910
Don't waste time with idle talk.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.760
When reporting to His Majesty,

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.920
we absolutely cannot

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.480
reveal the whole truth

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.710
about what happened on Mount Zhongnan.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:15.810
Talking about Ao Tian

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:16.590
is fine,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.870
but Li Nai'er's identity

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.870
must not be mentioned at all.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.910
Why not?

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.510
We cannot cause further conflict

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.240
between His Majesty and the Princess.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.150
That would plunge Chang'an

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.210
into bloody chaos.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.080
Su Wuming.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:32.610
Can such a thing

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.700
really be kept secret?

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.200
For now,

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.710
we should be able to keep it hidden.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.910
When it can no longer be concealed,

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.570
we'll have to leave it to fate.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.270
You want me to lie before His Majesty.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.770
I cannot do that.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.600
That makes it even easier then.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.510
Official Lu

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.600
is severely wounded
and unable to see His Majesty.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.860
I will go in your place.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.040
I'll follow your advice for now.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.280
But there are things

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.700
I must ask the Princess.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.150
There are matters

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.170
I need to understand clearly.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.670
Why bother?

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.720
Some things are better left unclear.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.250
I cannot remain in the dark.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.600
You know my relationship with her.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.160
People would say

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.620
I am the closest person to her.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.660
Yet I am also very distant.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.480
So distant

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.300
that I don't truly know her at all.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.000
It's as if

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.170
I never knew her.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:48.980
Ji.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.500
Come here quickly.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:52.840
Mother.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.320
It's freezing cold.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.390
Why are you using a fan?

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:03.910
Leave!

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.920
Your Highness, please wipe your sweat.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.240
Lu Lingfeng

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.590
is brave yet cautious,

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.390
and skilled in martial arts.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.110
With Su Wuming by his side,

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.740
he should be safe.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.750
What?

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.640
Su Wuming,

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.250
repeat what you just said.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:37.550
Is...

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.190
Is it that I

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.800
may not have spoken clearly

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.950
in some parts?

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.610
His Majesty
wants you to repeat everything.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.840
If there's even half a lie,

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.440
I'll cut off your head!

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.320
Then allow me to report
from the beginning.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.010
Your Highness!

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.380
Your Highness,

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.550
the team searching for Bai Ze

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.480
has returned from Mount Zhongnan.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.090
Why are you so flustered?

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.940
Commander Li and her guide Huo Jing

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200
didn't come back.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.580
What happened?

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.880
They encountered a fierce beast

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:21.740
and died.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.630
What about Lu Lingfeng?

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.320
Official Lu is severely wounded.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.670
Only Su Wuming escaped unharmed

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.530
and went to report to His Majesty.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.110
No wonder I dreamed of my son.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.370
Where is he wounded?

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.870
Is his life in danger?

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.190
The details are unknown.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.320
Where is my son now?

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.430
That's roughly what happened.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.270
Though they drove away the beast Ao Tian

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.800
and forced it off a cliff...

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.550
General Ding Heng
of the Right Imperial Guards,

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.620
Records Official Chen He,

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.030
Military Affairs Official Wei Qi,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.190
and Cavalry Official Huo You

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.530
all perished in battle.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.750
Commander of the Princess's Guards,
Li Nai'er,

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:05.980
also lost her life.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.880
But these five people

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.510
all faced the danger without fear.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.270
Together with
the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.800
Lu Lingfeng,
they fought Ao Tian to the death.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.140
The scene was heart-stopping

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.250
and what was even more touching

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.329
was that the five worked together,

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.069
each willing to sacrifice their lives.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:25.030
Whenever I

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.040
recall that scene,

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:28.610
I just...

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.150
Your Majesty,

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.330
condolences.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.770
How dare you, Du Ming!

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.920
You only listened to one hunter's words

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.720
and falsely claimed
an auspicious beast had appeared,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.550
leading to today's tragedy.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:51.010
How do you answer for that?

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:51.720
I...

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.190
I dare not speak carelessly.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.110
I only reported what the hunter said

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.920
exactly as it was told

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.020
to Su Wuming.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.720
The one who concluded it was Bai Ze

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.700
was him.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.230
Chief Administrator Du!

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.080
Chief Administrator Du,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.680
what was wrong

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:14.960
with my conclusion?

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.350
It wasn't Bai Ze at all.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.440
It was the fierce beast Ao Tian.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.400
-You said it yourself.
-Let me ask you!

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.240
Does Mount Zhongnan fall under
Yongzhou Prefecture's jurisdiction?

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:22.700
Well...

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.890
There was someone in the mountains
calling himself Hermit Baize

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.010
who occupied a temple
and raised a fierce beast,

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.000
robbing and killing people.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.730
Whose responsibility is this?

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.510
Du Ming

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.840
bears an inescapable responsibility.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.140
When a wise ruler appears, Bai Ze appears.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.960
This is heaven's way.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.660
Because the fierce beast Ao Tian
terrorized Mount Zhongnan,

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.310
Bai Ze had descended
to our world,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.900
but we were not fortunate enough
to see this auspicious beast.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.070
But our Tang Empire warriors,

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.920
united as one,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.290
killed Ao Tian

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.320
and suddenly saw the sky clear
and clouds part.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.390
and golden light
shines through the clouds,

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.220
and the call of the auspicious beast
was heard.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.570
At that moment,

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.830
birds sang, swallows danced,
deer called, and monkeys cried.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.780
All sounded like celestial music

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.640
and we felt as if bathed in spring breeze,

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.320
refreshed in body and mind.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.950
Even Lu Lingfeng who was severely injured

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:26.820
suddenly

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.570
improved quite a bit.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:30.750
Is it really so?

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.310
Did you really hear the call

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.480
of the auspicious beast?

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.010
It's absolutely true.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.320
That sound was almost like human speech,

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.620
as if expressing

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.960
a longing for peaceful times.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.680
Not only did I hear it

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.720
but everyone from Yongzhou Prefecture

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.160
who came to help

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.520
also heard it.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.680
-Congratulations, Your Majesty.
-Congratulations, Your Majesty.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.940
-Congratulations to the Tang Empire.
-Congratulations to the Tang Empire.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.520
It's just a pity about Ding Heng.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.120
They were all
meritorious officials of the Tanglong era,

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.500
my beloved generals.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.590
But because of a fierce beast,

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.680
they perished in Mount Zhongnan.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.820
Where are the bodies

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.920
of Ding Heng and the other three generals?

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.650
They're temporarily placed at
the Bai Ze Temple on Mount Zhongnan.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.440
Go there on my behalf

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.080
and give those four generals
a proper burial on Mount Zhongnan.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.640
Yongzhou Prefecture
will certainly handle this matter well.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.860
Did I tell you to go?

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.960
Please calm your anger, Your Majesty.
I acknowledge my fault.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.480
What fault do you have?

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.840
Tell me,

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.550
was Su Wuming telling the truth?

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.320
I don't know, Your Majesty.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.830
He speaks nothing but nonsense.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:41.630
Are you saying

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.070
that there is absolutely

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.030
no such thing as Bai Ze
appearing in this world?

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:45.640
No, no.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.550
Either

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.310
my beloved generals killed each other,

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.680
or those four imperial guards

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.750
were no match
for a female regimental commander.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:53.750
How could that be possible?

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.280
Then why did you say
he was speaking nonsense?

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.660
What a formidable disciple of Master Di.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.700
Not a single word of truth,

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.240
yet impossible to find fault with.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.990
And he still manages to save my face.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.290
Yes,

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.440
how frightening indeed.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.640
If in the near future,

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.030
he stands among the enemy ranks,

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.760
he would become
Your Majesty's greatest threat.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.400
For such a person...

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:21.920
Kill him

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.970
to prevent future trouble.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.590
But he ventured into the secret realm
of Mount Zhongnan

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.110
and brought back news of Bai Ze.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:29.170
How can we kill him?

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:35.790
Make way!

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.060
-Move!
-Move!

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:43.920
The Princess has arrived!

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.920
Those inside, come out to greet her!

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.270
[Great virtue can carry the world]

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.270
[Pei's Mansion]

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.900
[Great virtue can carry the world]

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.450
Fei Yingjun,

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.380
I trust your medical skills,

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.980
but I also know how vicious beasts can be.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:03.240
[Great virtue can carry the world]

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.450
I just want to hear from you directly.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.860
Is my son's life in danger?

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.420
Of course...

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.530
there's no danger to his life.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.210
I was just

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.170
about to change his dressing.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.200
Your Highness,

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:16.350
[Great virtue can carry the world]

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.350
Lu Lingfeng was seriously injured,

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.000
but with Miracle Doctor Fei's treatment,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.260
he is out of danger now.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.110
He's just preparing
to have his dressing changed,

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.110
so he couldn't come out to greet you.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.550
Then I can rest assured.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.990
Take me to see him now.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.590
Well done, Shangguan Nai'er.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.720
Fighting four enemies alone,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.780
she eliminated Lu Tong's
right-hand men in one breath.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.810
Truly a woman matching any man's valor.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.030
But she hurt my Ji.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.740
She deserved her fate anyway.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.270
Was Li Nai'er acting under your orders?

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.410
You must answer truthfully

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:58.770
without concealment.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.870
I am the Grand Princess.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.840
How dare a mere bandit-catching officer

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.790
interrogate me?

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.070
Your Highness still hasn't answered

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.800
my question.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.260
Li Nai'er

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.160
killed a few people

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.520
to avenge Wan'er.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.410
What's wrong with that?

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.830
That night Deposed Queen Wei was killed,

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.190
the night of rebellion,

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:32.720
I led the charge

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.080
as the General.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:35.270
So...

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.020
In your plan,

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.670
should I die too?

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.630
Here.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.680
Let me tell you about

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.440
Shangguan Wan'er.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.450
Wan'er suffered tragedy as an infant,

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.970
so the palace became her home.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.550
She was brilliant from a young age,

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.480
able to memorize everything at a glance.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.850
At 14 years old,

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.020
she went to Empress Wu Zetian's side,

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.310
handling official documents

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.110
and participating in important decisions.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.590
Writing with remarkable fluency,

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.320
she was admired by all at court.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.450
She was one year older than me.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.350
In that cold, fragrant palace,

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.070
with only the moonlight for company,

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:23.550
we became the best of friends.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:25.920
During the Shenlong era,

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.450
Zhang Jianzhi and others
forced my mother to abdicate.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.880
Under the pretext of restoring power
to the Li family,

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.280
they wanted to seize power for themselves.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.070
If not for the support Wan'er and I

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.310
offered,

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.840
how could my weak brother,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.330
the Emperor Zhongzong,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.550
have secured his throne?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.920
Later,

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.630
the Wei family seized power.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.550
Wan'er navigated carefully
between factions,

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.720
trying to stabilize
a precarious situation.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.700
Did you know

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.240
that Wan'er and I had already agreed

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.310
to work together from both sides

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:00.350
to support
the current Retired Emperor's ascension?

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.840
We were the true planners

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.830
of the Tanglong Palace coup.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:05.200
The one

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.110
sitting on the throne now

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.160
was merely the implementor

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.480
who stormed the palace.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.450
Yet for the sake of power,

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.090
he caused Wan'er

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.390
to die in the capital.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.030
Humans are more treacherous than demons.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.200
I've witnessed it myself.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:29.720
I buried Wan'er

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.310
in my family cemetery.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.150
Also buried with her

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.960
was a 982-character

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.920
epitaph.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.400
I deliberately had my name

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.510
engraved on it,

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.810
as a slap to his face,

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.580
accusing him of brutally killing
a loyal official.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.480
I want future generations to know

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.590
that heaven has its own justice.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:55.130
Your Highness,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.750
you still haven't truthfully answered

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:57.550
my question.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.350
Answer what?

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.670
Li Nai'er avenged Wan'er.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.200
She killed those
who were the executioners back then.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.510
Ding Heng was the one

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:09.720
who killed Wan'er.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.640
He deserved to die long ago.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.240
Answer my question!

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.750
Li Nai'er,
Commander of the Princess's Guards,

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.310
murdered four commanders
of the Imperial Guard.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.490
Was it under your orders?

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.600
This concerns many lives.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.800
You should answer truthfully.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.860
Since you're no longer in danger,

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.400
just focus on recovering.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.880
I'm leaving.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:34.750
Mother!

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.850
I want to know

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.720
the truth.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.510
Silly child.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.380
If I had ordered it,

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.690
how would you have gotten hurt?

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640
That's good then.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.650
Since it wasn't under your orders,

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.220
then what I fear most

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:12.480
won't happen,

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:13.830
right?

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.480
What are you worried about, my child?

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.340
Speak plainly.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.550
The Tang Empire
cannot withstand more turmoil.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.610
The people need peace and stability.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:30.160
Mother,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.340
I sincerely ask you

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.800
to stay away from court affairs

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.870
and enjoy your remaining years.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.860
Enjoy my remaining years?

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:02.710
Am I that old?

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.640
My mother

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.370
ascended the throne at 67 years old,

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:11.880
becoming China's first female emperor.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:13.720
Why

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.890
can't I follow her example?

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:20.470
Empress Wu, for the sake of power,

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.810
either forced or harmed

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.510
and killed her own two sons.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:26.440
Do you wish to follow that example too?

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.240
Unresolved incidents from the past

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.510
shouldn't be spoken of carelessly.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:35.400
Sometimes,

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.000
past events are just stories
told by people today.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.880
Then let's talk about the present.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.550
On Mount Zhongnan,

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.280
we didn't find traces of Bai Ze,

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.400
but we did hear
the call of an auspicious beast.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.630
The appearance of Bai Ze

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.350
is a good omen for the Tang Empire.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.350
It also indicates

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.680
that the current Emperor

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.720
is a wise ruler.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:56.660
I beg you, Mother,

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.760
not to go against heaven's will.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.660
This was also authorized by
the Emperor, right?

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.960
Fooling the common people is one thing,

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.720
but trying to fool me?

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.240
Besides,

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.370
how do you know

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.100
I wouldn't be a better emperor than him?

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.400
Is it just because

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.290
I am a woman?

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.550
I was born into

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.610
the world's unique imperial family.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.920
I grew up beside the Empress,

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.790
influenced by what I saw and heard.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.560
I've always wanted to be like my mother

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.440
to rectify the court

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.920
and bring prosperity to the people.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.400
Empress Wu Zetian had an eye

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.790
for recognizing, valuing,
and nurturing talent.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.550
Even someone like Shangguan Wan'er,

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:53.610
a descendant of a criminal official,

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.780
could be given important positions.

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:57.470
Does the current Emperor

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.130
possess

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.330
such magnanimity?

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:04.030
If he can't recognize talent
or distinguish loyalty from treachery,

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.550
him remaining on the throne

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.150
may destroy the Tang Empire.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:08.830
If one day

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.180
I truly face him in battle,

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.300
what I'm fighting for
is the fate of the Tang Empire!

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:16.590
My title

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.920
is Princess Protector of the State.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.500
Do you know

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.980
what "Protector of the State" means?

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.450
Lu Lingfeng,

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:30.310
you are my child.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.390
My blood flows through your veins.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.640
When the time comes,

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.200
whether you stand with him

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.870
or by my side,

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.510
what you should care about

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.200
is the nation's welfare

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.970
and the people's livelihood

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:46.180
to truly live up to the title
"Protector of the State."

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.220
Guards! Guards!

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.350
Guards!

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.480
Your Majesty,

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.590
what's wrong?

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.170
I dreamed of many venomous snakes

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.310
crawling out from these reports.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:44.360
Quickly,

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.800
take these old reports

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.750
and burn them all.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:47.370
No!

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.070
What's the use

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.820
of keeping them here?

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.790
Shangguan Wan'er's

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.880
imperial edicts
written on behalf of Emperor Zhongzong

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.680
are sometimes

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.160
more practical than my own

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.420
governance policies.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.000
No wonder Aunt was furious with me

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.520
after her death.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.880
She called her
a literary star fallen to earth,

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.540
the most talented
among the imperial consorts,

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.850
a devoted statesman to the empire.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.560
Why did I have such a dream?

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.440
Could I have executed the wrong person,

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.170
leading to Ding Heng
and the three other generals

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.860
meeting their deaths
in the jaws of a wild beast?

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.070
You may leave now.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.940
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.480
I remember

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.160
you grew up in the palace.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.160
Did you ever meet Shangguan Wan'er?

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:50.990
From the age of eight,

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.920
I worked at

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.750
Lady Shangguan's Ink Rhyme Pavilion,

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.720
grinding cinnabar for three years.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.740
What was she like?

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.440
She always reminded us

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.640
that when walking in the palace,

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.300
we should never let cinnabar
stain our sleeves,

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.360
just as officials

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.350
should never let
personal interests taint...

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.780
their work.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.139
So, you're saying

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:18.030
she was a loyal official?

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.230
After she was tattooed as punishment,

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.960
she was given calming incense,

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.350
but she didn't use it.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.320
She said...

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.770
What did she say?

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.480
She said those with guilty consciences

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.150
are the ones who use slumbering incense.

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:34.409
She kept her broken body awake
to better atone for her sins.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.510
Your Majesty,

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:36.800
the gastrodia powder is ready.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.400
Would you like to take it now?

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.710
I must drink this gastrodia powder
every day

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:43.909
to sleep peacefully.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.400
Could it be
because of a guilty conscience?

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.440
I didn't mean it that way.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.360
I misspoke.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:54.250
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:07.670
Your passing is like
the Xiao and Xiang Rivers run dry,

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:11.000
Mount Weiwan collapses,

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.880
pearls sink and break,

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.110
and jade shatters into pieces.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.530
I gaze at the pine trees,

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:32.310
listening silently at your tomb.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:35.950
May your virtue be extolled

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:43.030
for centuries onward.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.960
Chancellor Cui,

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:48.930
do you know your crime?

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.060
Your Highness,

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.760
I don't know what crime I've committed.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.190
Li Nai'er was Wan'er's adopted daughter.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.590
When you introduced her

00:35:58.590 --> 00:35:59.670
to the Princess's Mansion,

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.870
did you not know this?

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.030
I did not.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.360
With your relationship with Wan'er,

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.630
how could you not have known?

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:07.560
Chancellor Cui,

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.660
I can make you Chancellor,

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.590
but I can also have you

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.040
imprisoned at any time.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.360
I am well aware.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.280
Since I chose to follow Your Highness,

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.960
even if I'm thrown in prison

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.080
or lose my head,

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.230
I have no regrets.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.800
Today,

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:25.910
I would like to

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.790
congratulate you.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.280
As soon as the team searching for Bai Ze

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.480
returned to Chang'an,

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.230
rumors spread through the districts.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:33.280
They say Bai Ze's disappearance

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.600
is a heavenly warning,

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.670
that the one on the throne

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.270
is unworthy of the position.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.150
And the four commanders
of the Imperial Guard

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.880
who died in the jaws of the beast

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.630
have become a laughingstock.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.110
It seems

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.480
you not only knew about

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.870
Li Nai'er's identity,

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:49.150
but also knew about

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:50.390
all her plans.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.860
Weren't you afraid that my son Lu Lingfeng

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.250
might've met misfortune on this journey?

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.320
How dare you!

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.350
I'll kill you!

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.880
If one day,
I fail when success is within reach

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.710
and become a ghost under my enemy's blade,

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:14.590
I would rather

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.360
have my life ended

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:19.160
by your hand today.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.960
It would be my honor.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.380
What failure are you talking about?

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.980
How discouraging.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.630
The Cui clan of Boling

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.260
surpasses that of Qinghe.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.150
We never resort to flattery.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.520
Princess,

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:44.320
you are the one

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.150
most suited to rule the Tang Empire.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.280
For that day to come,

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.800
you must plan strategically

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.510
and be resolute in your decisions.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:51.590
Even if your closest relatives

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:52.780
stand in your way,

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.230
they must be eliminated.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.090
On this matter,

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:56.840
Your Highness should think more about

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.640
how Empress Wu

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:59.270
handled such situations.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.620
Du Ming, as the official of the capital,

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.670
falsely claimed auspicious signs
and failed in his duties.

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:16.190
Will the Censorate not intervene?

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.000
Since His Majesty abdicated
to become the Retired Emperor,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:20.700
Du Ming

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.880
has clearly allied himself
with the current Emperor.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.000
We can use this opportunity

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.480
to expel him from Chang'an.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.740
What a brilliant plan!

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.030
I'll see to it immediately.
