00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.000
Why didn't you

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.640
answer my call?

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.479
Zeng Jie,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.639
what brings you here?

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.360
Let me know if you come.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.439
You're so busy.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.199
I'll go see you.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.879
Cut the crap.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.319
Are you avoiding me lately?

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:21.319
Why would I avoid you?

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.879
I-I've been sick.

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:24.800
I had a fever.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.800
Touch it.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.759
Still hot.

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.000
Where's the fever?

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.520
I-It broke out last night.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.639
It went down this morning.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.520
I forgot to charge my phone.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.400
I'm still feeling weak.

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:40.280
I'm going to take a rest.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.919
The tea's still warm.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.159
Where did you rest?

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.360
Don't pretend with me.

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:56.599
Just answer me.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.360
Has Yang Zhenghui contacted you lately?

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:00.599
No.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.479
Any messages?

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.400
Nothing either.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.800
Well, really nothing.

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.080
What's this about?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.560
I'm not lying.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.199
Besides,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.199
isn't it better if Yang Zhenghui

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.800
didn't contact me?

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.080
Right?

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.479
What's wrong?

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.000
You look pale.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.120
I don't know.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:35.039
Recently,

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.400
strange people keep popping up.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400
Stop your act.

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.800
Why put on an act?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.919
I'm not pretending.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.599
I saw my sister the other day.

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:56.680
What nonsense is it?

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.879
I'm serious! Why would I lie?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.120
Right here.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.240
I was sitting here that day,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.039
I saw my sister

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.879
standing right there,

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.439
wiping the table.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.879
You’re seeing things.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.680
How is that impossible?

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.240
She was smiling at me from there.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.040
Were you drunk?

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:22.959
How could I have been drinking

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.160
so early in the morning?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.279
You made this up on purpose?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.319
No way.

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:42.360
When are you

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.079
when do you plan to rebuild it?

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:45.920
Soon.

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:47.800
Alright.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.839
If funds fall short,

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.319
I'll help however I can.

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:56.160
But remember.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.600
If anyone come find you,

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.240
you must tell me.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.600
No problem.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.680
I'll follow your lead completely.

00:05:29.397 --> 00:05:30.862
It scared me.

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:37.959
Compared to 1990,

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.920
modern forensic methods

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.879
have greatly advanced.

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:44.439
New technologies keep emerging.

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:45.879
As forensic technology

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.439
continues to develop and update,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.439
the principle of solving all homicides

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:51.639
is persistently enforced

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.160
by countless officers

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.639
(Big Hui Video)
through blood and sacrifice.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.040
The law's net stretches wide,

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.600
but not neglected.

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:01.079
No matter where criminals flee,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.600
justice will find them.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.120
The Kang Woodchipper Murder Case

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:12.160
marked the first time in Kang history

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:14.000
that a murder

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.319
without a body was solved.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.920
(Look carefully.)

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:25.160
Do you know her?

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.720
Why did you come to me?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.720
You know her,

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:28.639
right?

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.399
I don't know her.

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:32.079
Even if I do, so what?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.600
(Zeng Jie,)

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:39.839
someone just came to my mind.

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:40.720
Who?

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:42.120
Liu Wei.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.839
(They were just here to check)

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:52.600
how Lin Fang died.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.480
(I will find every way)

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.319
(to bring you down,)

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:00.079
making you lose your job

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:01.399
and ruining your reputation.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.560
(You'd end up back)

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.600
(to the broke life,)

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.480
(full of blemish flaws.)

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:07.680
(Remember.)

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.959
(The Tomb of Zeng Qiang)
(You don't care about your dad's life.)

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.839
(What else do you care about?)

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.199
Nothing can stop you.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.720
Master Zeng,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.160
800,000 in cash.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.040
You should be able to prepare it soon.

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:30.079
I calculated

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.639
how much 800,000 in cash would be

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.439
before getting this case.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.000
Now you have quite a bit of money.

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.160
What's your plan?

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.560
When I used to livestream,

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.439
a big supporter

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.560
sent me a lot of gifts.

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:45.040
It wasn't that much.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.600
For a mere streamer

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.639
like me who's never seen

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.600
much of the world,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.000
it was really shocking.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.680
But before long,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.600
he stopped spending.

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:53.480
He told me

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.120
he went broke after his startup failed.

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:57.319
He gave me one piece of advice.

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:58.800
He said if I could earn

00:07:58.839 --> 00:07:59.959
a large amount of money,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.040
if I don't make investments

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:03.160
or start businesses,

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:04.839
I could live comfortably.

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:07.920
I'd first splurge a bit.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.360
Go on a trip,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.480
first class,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.680
five-star hotel kind of trip.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.079
Then I'd think hard

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.959
about what to do.

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:15.920
But whatever I do,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.480
I will completely say goodbye

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:18.560
to my past life

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:20.240
and start fresh.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.360
A brand-new start.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.160
So,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.799
I want to thank you.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.279
I really like you.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.000
But I want a future even more.

00:08:47.679 --> 00:08:49.240
You sell yourself

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.120
for money

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:53.600
and blackmail people.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.279
Do you deserve a future?

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.840
Master Zeng,

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:00.240
mind your dignity.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.879
Do you deserve dignity?

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:09.519
I don't.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.000
Of course, I don't.

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:12.320
I'm shameless now

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.879
just to have dignity in the future.

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:15.279
Master Zeng,

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:16.799
did you earn dignity

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:17.799
by marrying your wife?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.679
Weren't you after her money?

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.519
Wasn't she scheming

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:22.000
to divorce you for money?

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:23.360
What do you have

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.879
to look down upon me?

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:26.399
Come on.

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:28.080
We're all the same.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.360
To you, 800,000 in cash

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:44.519
isn't much.

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:47.120
Don't lose your dignity
over this amount.

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.279
After all,

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.639
we used to like each other.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.399
Get lost.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.759
Don't let me see you again.

00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:56.840
Everyone I knew before today,

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.080
I don't wish to see them again.

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:43.240
(Take your wife on a trip.)

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:44.840
At least,

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.799
pretend to be a good husband.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.039
I can't pretend anymore.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.799
It's too tiring.

00:10:56.879 --> 00:10:58.000
I'm exhausted.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.360
Why are you looking at me?

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.600
If you want a divorce, just do it.

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:07.600
Don't look at me.

00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:09.279
Like I've said before,

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:10.960
even if you get divorced,

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:12.759
I won't marry you.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.840
When I'm with you,

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.200
it's the most relaxing.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:21.919
Because I won't expect from you

00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:23.639
what I'd expect from a husband.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.120
I also won't expect

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.600
what I'd expect from a boyfriend.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:27.720
When a woman

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.080
has no demands,

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.840
it's easier for a man.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.799
It's just not the right time

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.559
for me to divorce.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.000
Can we talk about something else?

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.919
Do you think discussing

00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:47.000
whether you should divorce

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.960
is appropriate?

00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:53.120
I really want my life

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320
to start anew.

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:56.559
Then I wish you success.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:58.759
But

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.360
don't involve me.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.000
My life has always been fine.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.600
After breaking up with you,

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.480
it'll still be good.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.200
Breaking up?

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:15.919
It's about time.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.679
After these years being with you,

00:12:18.919 --> 00:12:19.919
I've known you well.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.679
You're just like my dad.

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:23.840
You only care about yourselves,

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:25.519
selfish and self-serving.

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:26.720
I've been tired of it.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.240
But I kept enduring it.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.960
Look at you now.

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:31.720
Out of ten meetings,

00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:33.360
you complain all ten times

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:35.080
about your marriage and your life.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.200
It's utterly dull.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.919
You used to make me feel relaxed.

00:12:44.919 --> 00:12:46.080
I also made you feel relaxed.

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:47.960
So we could keep going.

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:49.440
But now,

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.039
you don't ease my mind anymore.

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:52.360
So it's time to stop.

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:57.320
Take your wife on a trip.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.720
Change your mood.

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:01.519
Come back and get a divorce if you want.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.639
If you don't want that,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.440
just find another girl.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.159
Anyway,

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:07.960
I'll quit.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.279
Break up just after a few words.

00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:19.879
Is it that casual?

00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:22.240
Isn't us being together

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:24.080
even more casual?

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:36.559
That's right.

00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:38.039
Don't try to detain me.

00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:40.759
If you do,

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.879
you are not charming.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:44.879
Ms. Juan.

00:14:53.879 --> 00:14:54.480
Ms. Juan.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.759
So you just can't let go.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.120
Everyone's been young.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.720
Are you still young now?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.840
First love

00:15:01.039 --> 00:15:02.840
is always unforgettable.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.840
What's so funny?

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.879
What first love?

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.279
It was just first simp.

00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:10.480
Ms. Juan, listen.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.840
I first met Bai Xiaoling

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.960
in college.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.360
She captivated all of us

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.279
at that time.

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:17.320
We investigated

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.840
her family background

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.240
very soon.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.919
She was rich and beautiful.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:22.879
I knew

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.399
I was certainly not her match.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.240
At that time, I saw

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.399
those boys hanging

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:28.519
around her dorm.

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:29.360
Compared to them,

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.240
I

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:31.559
had no money,

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.000
and was ugly.

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:34.840
There was definitely no chance.

00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:36.399
At that time,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.320
I set myself a goal.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.360
I must become strong

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.559
and go to grad school.

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:41.879
After graduating,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.799
I had to pass the bar exam

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.200
in the shortest time possible,

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.039
and become a law firm partner.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:47.919
So

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.759
Bai Xiaoling

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.080
was the benefactor in your life.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.279
She really was.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.960
If it weren't for her,

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:57.600
I might have ended up like some

00:15:57.679 --> 00:15:58.480
college classmates,

00:15:58.679 --> 00:15:59.440
idling away,

00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:00.279
doing nothing.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.080
I don't know

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.039
which little law firm

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.519
I would be working at.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.279
Listen.

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:06.240
In my college years,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.000
I did work hard.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.000
Every night, I stayed up late,

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:09.799
reading books,

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:11.240
reviewing files,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.039
studying cases.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.559
When hungry, I'd take some buns.

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:15.120
When tired,

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:16.519
I'd glance at Bai Xiaoling.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.159
Just looking at her,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.559
I was filled with strength.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.159
She also read

00:16:22.159 --> 00:16:23.159
in the college library?

00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:25.240
Could she really be in the library?

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.360
I glanced at this.

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:31.000
A placebo for the mind?

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:33.159
What does the "Zheng"

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.480
next to it mean?

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.159
At that time,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.919
I set a threshold for myself.

00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:39.519
A girl

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.000
as outstanding as Bai Xiaoling

00:16:41.159 --> 00:16:42.336
couldn't possibly be single.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.559
Many guys were after her.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.399
She might make a few poor choices.

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:48.240
But there's a high probability

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.639
that she wouldn't choose me,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.360
right?

00:16:50.679 --> 00:16:51.279
So,

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.960
I have to face this reality.

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:54.519
I told myself

00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:57.559
to give Bai Xiaoling three chances.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.000
What do you mean?

00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:00.919
He allowed Bai Xiaoling

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.279
to have three relationships.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.359
Is that so humble?

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:06.279
What do you know?

00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:07.440
What if she has more?

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.000
Then he would

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.519
give Bai Xiaoling another chance.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.200
Isn't that lacking self-respect?

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.440
He'd still give her more chances,

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:15.079
one after another.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.599
How many boyfriends
did she have in total?

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:19.799
In the photo,

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.599
isn't there a record?

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.279
Mr. Ye,

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:26.680
true love.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.240
Ten years later,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.240
I became a partner at the law firm.

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:31.480
And she

00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:33.680
married Zeng Jie.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.880
You didn't stay single
thinking about her, did you?

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.079
No, no, no.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.880
Thinking about her, sure.

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:42.039
But it has nothing to do

00:17:42.079 --> 00:17:43.359
with whether I marry or not.

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:45.440
Even if she's divorced now,

00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:47.079
I still couldn't be with her.

00:17:47.279 --> 00:17:48.519
It's unrelated to her being

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.039
in a wheelchair now.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.160
Bai Xiaoling

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.680
is just his spiritual support,

00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:55.079
and his utopia.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.960
When he was struggling before,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.799
Bai Xiaoling's existence

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.119
was motivation and encouragement.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.400
Now that his life is better,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.720
Bai Xiaoling's presence
is just a regret.

00:18:07.079 --> 00:18:08.200
To make up for regrets,

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.480
there are many ways.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.759
You don't lack women now.

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:15.119
What you lack is Bai Xiaoling's attitude

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.559
towards you.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.119
Even if she's now

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.039
disabled,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.319
or even if

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:23.119
she doesn't admit

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.880
her choice back then was wrong.

00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:31.680
We women,

00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:33.480
when young,

00:18:33.599 --> 00:18:34.799
want to find someone

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.000
who can protect us,

00:18:37.359 --> 00:18:38.279
has money,

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.079
and spoils us like a hero.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.920
After maturing,

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.000
we become compassionate,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.680
overly nurturing.

00:18:46.359 --> 00:18:47.599
Young girls are easily fooled.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.319
Mature women are perceptive.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.039
Just like men.

00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:53.279
When most men are young,

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:54.519
they can't find

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.319
a girlfriend to share hardships with.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.519
After becoming wealthy,

00:18:58.079 --> 00:18:59.039
they all feel

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:00.279
like they are the savior.

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:02.920
Young boys are stupid,

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.960
while guys at your age

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:06.920
are bad.

00:19:08.759 --> 00:19:10.279
I'm a good man.

00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:11.119
I'm good.

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:12.440
Come on.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.160
Cheers.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:13.920
It's alright.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.920
What about you?

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.519
Well, me?

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.880
Why do you want to help Bai Xiaoling?

00:19:22.519 --> 00:19:23.640
You don't even like her.

00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:25.039
You're into video production.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.880
Why do this?

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.519
How much can you make?

00:19:29.319 --> 00:19:29.960
Not much.

00:19:30.119 --> 00:19:31.640
Barely enough to get by.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.079
The income is unstable.

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:34.599
Busy investigating lately,

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.720
I haven't updated

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:36.720
and had no income.

00:19:37.279 --> 00:19:38.000
Before,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.440
I thought my ex-girlfriend

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:40.839
was killed by Zeng Jie.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.160
It turned out

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.240
she was perfectly fine.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.839
Later, as I kept digging,

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.000
I uncovered more and more

00:19:46.079 --> 00:19:47.039
of Zeng Jie's secrets.

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:49.160
Let's say it's my professional habit.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.000
Now,

00:19:51.359 --> 00:19:52.559
I want to help Bai Xiaoling,

00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:54.200
because I think she's unfortunate.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.599
Even if she's in a wheelchair,

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.599
she's still richer.

00:19:58.119 --> 00:19:59.039
How could you think

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.359
she's unfortunate?

00:20:01.319 --> 00:20:01.839
Ms. Juan,

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.880
those are wise words.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.960
I invited you here today

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.000
for this meal,

00:20:08.359 --> 00:20:09.400
just to ask

00:20:09.599 --> 00:20:11.319
why you are helping Bai Xiaoling.

00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:14.960
I'm

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:16.119
actually someone

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.200
who enjoys gossip.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.039
I've already paid the bill.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.680
You can take your time drinking.

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:23.000
I'm leaving now.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:23.839
Thanks.

00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:33.000
Is this expensive?

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:34.240
It doesn't taste bitter.

00:20:34.599 --> 00:20:35.319
It's decent.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.920
Bordeaux Grand Cru.

00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:38.960
Nearly ten thousand per bottle.

00:20:39.119 --> 00:20:39.880
That's crazy!

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.559
Oh, my god!

00:20:45.559 --> 00:20:47.000
After talking with Ms. Juan,

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.400
why do I feel more uneasy?

00:20:48.759 --> 00:20:50.880
Being called poor makes you uneasy, huh?

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.359
No,

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.720
Ms. Juan knows Zeng Jie better than us.

00:20:55.079 --> 00:20:55.839
But all night,

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.240
she didn't mention Zeng Jie's

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.000
character at all.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.799
Instead, she seemed to probe us.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.680
Seeing it this way,

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:01.359
I'm more sure

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:02.480
he'd go after Bai Xiaoling.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.319
Going on a mountain trip

00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:07.119
with Xiaoling in a wheelchair,

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.279
it'd make sense

00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:09.240
if something happened.

00:21:09.319 --> 00:21:09.920
Yes.

00:21:10.359 --> 00:21:11.000
Stop her.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.039
We can't let her go.

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:13.240
Don't you think

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:14.759
she really wants to go herself?

00:21:15.319 --> 00:21:16.160
I've explained to her

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:17.319
and told her everything

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:18.000
about Zeng Jie.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.759
It was useless.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.200
L-Let me think.

00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:23.000
Do you have any ideas?

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.599
I...

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.799
I'll go with her.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.480
Deal then.

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:30.720
I can't stick around the whole time.

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:31.839
You go with her.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.000
Mount Qingcheng isn't far.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.400
If there is anything, call me.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.519
I'll be there in two hours.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.359
Here's the thing.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:39.799
This time,

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.000
all the expenses

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:43.200
will be covered by me.

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:44.519
The money in this card

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.519
(Bank card)
is absolutely enough.

00:21:46.119 --> 00:21:48.440
Password 061011.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.200
Well, how could I possibly

00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:53.160
use your money?

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:55.079
What comes after 06?

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.920
1011.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.880
Bai Xiaoling student ID number.

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:02.400
You do really like her.

00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:22.119
Does it look good?

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.680
Fantastic.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.519
You wear this too?

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.720
Yeah, I haven't worn it for long.

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:33.799
Those clothes on the bed.

00:22:34.039 --> 00:22:35.279
Which one should I wear?

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.359
Anything looks great.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.480
How about

00:22:37.759 --> 00:22:38.640
we take them all.

00:22:39.319 --> 00:22:41.000
It's only two days. No time to change.

00:22:41.519 --> 00:22:42.680
Help me pick one.

00:22:46.119 --> 00:22:46.799
How about this?

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.119
Sure.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.240
Luggage's packed

00:22:50.319 --> 00:22:51.359
in the living room.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.400
Anything else you want to bring?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.279
Satisfied with this room?

00:23:29.519 --> 00:23:30.240
It's pretty good.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.519
Thank you, honey.

00:23:36.319 --> 00:23:37.400
Could you

00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:37.960
help me

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.319
open the red suitcase?

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.200
Okay.

00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:45.559
Open the zipper on the left panel.

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:47.480
Give me that fruit knife, please.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.440
This knife is so cool.

00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:55.240
My husband

00:23:55.319 --> 00:23:56.720
bought it when he went abroad.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.920
It's very handy.

00:23:58.599 --> 00:23:59.440
He loves cleanliness.

00:24:02.599 --> 00:24:03.240
Thank you.

00:24:12.319 --> 00:24:13.000
Honey.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.079
When we drove in just now,

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.319
there were locals

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.880
selling kiwis from a cart.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.559
Don't you like eating them?

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.559
You want some, right?

00:24:22.319 --> 00:24:23.000
I'll go buy some.

00:24:23.359 --> 00:24:24.079
Sure.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.000
You still keep this?

00:25:23.319 --> 00:25:23.960
I also keep

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.680
the clothes you left at my place.

00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:29.119
Let me make it clear.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.200
There's no way we'll get back together.

00:25:32.359 --> 00:25:32.960
Don't worry.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.160
I'm here

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.799
just to ask you something.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.640
Then I'll leave.

00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:38.319
I absolutely won't bother you again.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.559
You'd better do.

00:25:40.359 --> 00:25:41.759
Changing my number is a hassle.

00:25:42.079 --> 00:25:42.759
I won't.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.759
I will never contact you again.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.599
Go ahead.

00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:56.240
Last year, you left me

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.200
for Professor Zeng,

00:25:57.319 --> 00:25:58.000
right?

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.160
What Professor Zeng?

00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:04.359
Who is Professor Zeng?

00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:05.440
Last year, you made

00:26:05.519 --> 00:26:06.960
a ceramic dish at Light Strokes.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.480
Didn't Professor Zeng teach you?

00:26:08.599 --> 00:26:09.319
I once took

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:10.599
a trial class at Light Strokes.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.839
I wanted to learn ceramics.

00:26:12.119 --> 00:26:12.839
How would I know

00:26:12.839 --> 00:26:13.680
the teacher's name?

00:26:14.599 --> 00:26:16.279
He also taught you
what blemish flaws are.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.000
Yes.

00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:19.200
I asked at Light Strokes.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.000
Nobody mentioned blemish flaws.

00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:22.359
Only Professor Zeng

00:26:22.359 --> 00:26:23.680
would care about blemish flaws.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.240
No other teachers.

00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:27.359
Only Professor Zeng
would care about them.

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:29.440
He is also

00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:30.279
a perfectionist.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.759
He often mentions

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.759
pursuing perfection

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.359
and striving for near perfection.

00:26:41.759 --> 00:26:42.400
Wei.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.039
I really don't blame you for anything.

00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:47.559
I just want to get to the truth.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:48.839
I never mind

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:50.559
that you lied to me before.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.799
Yang Zhenghui, clarify what you mean.

00:26:54.119 --> 00:26:55.200
What did I lie about?

00:26:56.359 --> 00:26:57.559
Did you truly never lie to me,

00:26:58.279 --> 00:26:59.039
Tang Wei?

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.200
I've been Liu Wei for years.

00:27:04.759 --> 00:27:05.640
Before I met you,

00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:06.519
I was Liu Wei.

00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:07.880
This isn't lying to you.

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:10.400
I don't know

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.680
why you keep holding onto me?

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.039
But Yang Zhenghui,

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.519
I don't even know

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.279
Zeng Jie

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.599
or what he does.

00:27:16.839 --> 00:27:18.359
How do you know his name is Zeng Jie?

00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:22.000
You just said it yourself.

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:23.960
I've been calling him Professor Zeng.

00:27:24.119 --> 00:27:24.599
I didn't say

00:27:24.759 --> 00:27:25.960
the name Zeng Jie on purpose.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.559
I meant to save you

00:27:34.599 --> 00:27:35.559
some face.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.200
But you insisted on bringing it up.

00:27:40.119 --> 00:27:40.839
Alright.

00:27:42.039 --> 00:27:43.240
I know Zeng Jie.

00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:45.880
Not only do I know him,
but I've been with him.

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:50.319
But Yang Zhenghui,

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.000
when I was with you,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.160
I didn't cheat on you.

00:27:53.599 --> 00:27:54.240
We were just

00:27:54.319 --> 00:27:55.039
casually together.

00:27:55.079 --> 00:27:56.039
We also met casually.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.559
We never planned to make it last.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.720
After I met Zeng Jie,

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.599
I thought he was great.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.759
He's the type I like.

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:04.440
Plus, he's rich

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.160
and talented,

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.359
making me admire him.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.599
I just like him.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.839
So I broke up with you.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.519
Yang Zhenghui,

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.440
I only got together with him

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:14.680
after we formally broke up.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.000
Yes.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.680
You sent me a message

00:28:17.759 --> 00:28:18.440
very formally.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.440
Wasn't that formal?

00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:20.960
And then?

00:28:21.359 --> 00:28:22.119
What "and then"?

00:28:22.359 --> 00:28:23.119
You and Zeng Jie.

00:28:23.319 --> 00:28:24.279
We broke up.

00:28:24.319 --> 00:28:25.200
He's married.

00:28:25.359 --> 00:28:26.720
Didn't he cling to you?

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.079
As a married man,

00:28:29.359 --> 00:28:30.839
how dare he cling to me?

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.440
Then why did you move,

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.359
disappear,

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.279
and change number?

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:40.079
Because I felt

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:40.720
that my life

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.359
in the past was a complete mess.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.640
What was I even doing?

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.200
What kind

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:48.559
of people have I met?

00:28:49.559 --> 00:28:50.480
Yang Zhenghui.

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:52.440
Actually, you are fine.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.319
I mean it.

00:28:54.119 --> 00:28:55.039
It's just

00:28:55.519 --> 00:28:56.640
that you had nothing.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.160
There was no future for us.

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:02.799
I want to start fresh,

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.319
forget everything in the past,

00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:05.319
and cut all ties.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.720
I don't want

00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:07.599
to associate myself

00:29:07.599 --> 00:29:08.880
with my terrible past anymore.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.880
C-Can you understand me?

00:29:35.519 --> 00:29:36.039
Take a call.

00:29:36.039 --> 00:29:36.839
Wait a moment.

00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:42.160
Hello?

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:44.640
Hello, Big Hui. Are you busy?

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.960
I want to tell you something.

00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:48.160
Go ahead.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.160
I...

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.079
I'm free to talk.

00:29:50.319 --> 00:29:50.839
Free.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.559
Actually, I wanted

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.759
to tell you long time ago,

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.680
but I didn't know how to start.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.319
It's not a good thing.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.000
To be precise,

00:30:00.839 --> 00:30:02.039
it's a shame of mine.

00:30:03.079 --> 00:30:04.640
But I didn't expect

00:30:05.319 --> 00:30:06.079
it involves you.

00:30:06.759 --> 00:30:07.680
Involves me?

00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:08.720
Yes.

00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:09.640
I've wanted

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.160
to tell you this for a long time.

00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:13.759
I know Liu Wei,

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.799
and Liu Wei knows my husband too.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.640
There was something between them.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.720
Years ago,

00:30:27.839 --> 00:30:28.680
my husband and I

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:30.319
started having communication issues.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.440
I began considering divorce.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.400
My family is financially

00:30:34.519 --> 00:30:35.319
better off than his.

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:36.359
So if we divorce,

00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:37.920
I will suffer a significant loss.

00:30:38.359 --> 00:30:39.839
I know my husband

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.000
often has contacts

00:30:41.079 --> 00:30:42.559
with other women.

00:30:43.519 --> 00:30:44.240
But I can't find

00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:45.519
enough evidence.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.400
So...

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.799
Is this person reliable?

00:30:51.839 --> 00:30:52.759
The boss said she is.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.680
As your demands,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.599
she is beautiful

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.400
and pretty classy.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.599
She just wants the money

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.440
and she's willing

00:30:57.519 --> 00:30:58.279
to do anything.

00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:09.519
(What does she do?)

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.279
(Influencer.)

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:12.320
(Live streamer.)

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.319
(Not many followers.)

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:14.599
(These young girls)

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.559
(don't care much.)

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.160
Don't worry.

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:18.079
Once get paid,

00:31:18.079 --> 00:31:19.559
I will do a good job.

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:21.759
(Through someone else,)

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.119
(I met Liu Wei)

00:31:23.599 --> 00:31:24.680
(and paid her a deposit.)

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.319
(I told her)

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.640
(how to better approach Zeng Jie)

00:31:29.119 --> 00:31:29.960
(and attract him.)

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.079
What are blemish flaws?

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.440
What are blemish flaws?

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.279
You can think of it

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:40.000
as an insignificant imperfection.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:40.960
Just like

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.480
Pinhead-sized holes

00:31:42.839 --> 00:31:43.480
in orange peels.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.960
(Ordinary people wouldn't care at all.)

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.519
(But for some people,)

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.160
it's unbearable.

00:31:49.359 --> 00:31:50.799
I've always wanted to smash it.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.200
Thanks to you.

00:31:52.519 --> 00:31:53.359
It seems

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.079
she really understands you.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.519
What did you say?

00:31:56.839 --> 00:31:57.839
She was very successful.

00:31:58.759 --> 00:31:59.680
She got it done

00:31:59.759 --> 00:32:01.079
in a very short time.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.119
Take it.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.440
We're even now. You can go.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.279
But

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:08.279
I didn't

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:09.440
expect her to be so cunning.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.359
She took my money

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.559
and then

00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:14.079
extorted my husband as well.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.480
Zeng Jie,

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.640
I think there is something

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.240
you should take a look at.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.519
It belongs

00:32:20.759 --> 00:32:21.599
to you and Liu Wei.

00:32:22.039 --> 00:32:22.880
I also have something

00:32:23.119 --> 00:32:24.000
which belongs to you

00:32:24.519 --> 00:32:25.519
and Liu Wei.

00:32:28.359 --> 00:32:30.279
It's only right to get paid
for helping others.

00:32:30.319 --> 00:32:31.559
Why can't I take it?

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.400
I've done what you

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.799
wanted me to do.

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:35.960
Yet you just don't let me go.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.279
What do you really want?

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.119
If you don't let me go,

00:32:39.759 --> 00:32:41.240
I'll fight you to the end.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.359
Let's see who gives up first,

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.640
you or me.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.960
It's not like I don't know

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.240
why you want a divorce.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.359
Is it something to be proud of if told?

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.400
As long as you let me go,

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:54.160
I'll disappear immediately.

00:32:55.319 --> 00:32:56.799
I was going to disappear anyway.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.079
You will never

00:32:58.119 --> 00:32:59.440
see me again.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.359
I don't want to see

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.559
the current me either.

00:33:08.839 --> 00:33:10.640
I was so angry I almost went crazy.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:12.839
But fortunately,

00:33:13.319 --> 00:33:14.839
I calmed down quickly.

00:33:16.319 --> 00:33:17.640
Because I realized

00:33:18.359 --> 00:33:19.480
that every step I've taken

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.000
to get here

00:33:22.079 --> 00:33:23.240
was my own choice.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.799
I have a family and an appearance

00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:26.680
others envy.

00:33:27.319 --> 00:33:29.119
Yet, my marriage is a failure.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.839
I guess that's

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.720
what you call give and take.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.039
Because of the Liu Wei incident,

00:33:37.759 --> 00:33:39.359
I had a direct talk with Zeng Jie.

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:40.920
We made an agreement

00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:42.039
that from now on,

00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:44.079
no one should talk about this

00:33:44.079 --> 00:33:45.480
disgusting and sordid experience.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.160
We would try

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.000
to see

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.440
if our marriage can continue.

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:54.400
You know everything

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.400
after that.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.440
After Zeng Jie Studio caught fire,

00:33:58.839 --> 00:34:00.599
and I was disabled in a car accident,

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:03.440
it only took a year

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.200
for me to become who I am now.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:10.519
Big Hui,

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:12.280
what you and Zhang Ye told me

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.440
about Zeng Jie,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.920
I've actually known

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.079
some of them long ago.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.000
I didn't want to admit because I wanted

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.760
to give myself

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.880
a bit of dignity.

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:24.679
This time, Zeng Jie brought me out.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:26.079
Actually, we just want

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.239
to try and see

00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:29.199
whether we can continue being together.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.559
I do appreciate

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:33.079
you and Zhang Ye worrying about me.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.079
I thought for long

00:34:35.079 --> 00:34:36.400
before making this call to you.

00:34:37.039 --> 00:34:38.559
Because I feel I shouldn't hide

00:34:38.559 --> 00:34:39.840
things about Liu Wei from you.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:42.800
Even though you already broke up,

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.920
it's actually a good thing you broke up.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.519
A girl like her

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.119
doesn't deserve you.

00:34:58.039 --> 00:34:58.760
There's no

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.159
such thing as deserving or not.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.519
Who am I, anyway?

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.199
After all,

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.119
Wei is a beautiful girl.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.159
I'm just

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.079
an ordinary

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:09.599
person, nothing special.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.480
I really want to have you as a friend,

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.480
but the things I've done,

00:35:17.559 --> 00:35:18.679
those dirty things,

00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:20.199
make me feel

00:35:21.039 --> 00:35:22.360
unworthy of your friendship.

00:35:24.159 --> 00:35:25.880
Don't say that.

00:35:26.199 --> 00:35:26.840
Don't say that.

00:35:27.159 --> 00:35:28.840
Bai Xiaoling, you are actually

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.039
quite kind.

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:30.639
I mean it.

00:35:32.199 --> 00:35:32.920
You can blame me

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.239
for the Liu Wei issue.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.039
You can even scold me.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.159
No.

00:35:45.039 --> 00:35:45.920
I won't blame you.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:46.960
Likewise,

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.440
I won't blame Wei either.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.840
What right do I have anyway?

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.719
Bai Xiaoling,

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:15.880
if you still

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.760
consider me a friend,

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.960
listen to me this time.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.239
Big Hui,

00:36:22.039 --> 00:36:22.760
I know

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:25.480
you don't want me to travel.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.079
But I'm already here.

00:36:29.719 --> 00:36:30.760
W-What are you saying?

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.280
Where are you now?

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.719
W-Which hotel?

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:35.519
See you in a few days.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.119
Hello?

00:37:02.368 --> 00:37:03.136
It's okay.

00:37:04.416 --> 00:37:05.824
It's okay, just a small issue.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:09.952
Zeng Jie and I, after all,
came from poor families.

00:37:09.984 --> 00:37:13.344

is a bit better, pretty average...
