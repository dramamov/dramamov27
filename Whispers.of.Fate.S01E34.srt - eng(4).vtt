[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.960
[Episode 34]

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.600
What about Shei?

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.020
Shouldn't you be angry about that?

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.950
Before I answer,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.530
I also want to ask you

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.479
a question.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.800
What's the relationship

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.170
between Shei and Fang Zhou?

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.229
Why do you ask?

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.450
These 4 years,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.150
I've been wandering around jianghu.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.870
Many people like me,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.920
and many dislike me,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.560
but hatred—

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.360
I've only seen it in Liu Yan's eyes

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.000
and in Shei's.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.430
I'm not a good man,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.350
but I've done nothing

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.630
to deserve such hatred

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.579
from a stranger.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.670
The only explanation

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.660
is Fang Zhou.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.400
She's Fang Zhou's younger sister.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.150
I see.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.680
So this time,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.370
you should be angry, right?

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.520
No.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.500
You're laughing?

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.840
Is...

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.790
Is this joy?

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.400
No.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.250
Then what is it?

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.320
Among all these masks of yours,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.660
none...

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.730
show my feelings.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.580
It's...

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.000
It's impossible.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.250
These are all the expressions I recorded.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.930
Then tell me,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.960
is there one

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.400
that can hold joy

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.960
and anger,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.360
sorrow

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.590
and happiness,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.150
love

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.079
and hate all at once?

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.680
Is there...

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.540
such an expression in this world?

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.120
Mr. Tang,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.340
are you teasing me?

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.670
Knowing that Fang Zhou has family alive

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.120
brings joy.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.980
Knowing that his family is being used

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.110
brings anger.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.880
Knowing that they will never be reunited

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.930
brings sorrow.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.790
And knowing that this person

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.210
is Shei...

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.460
brings happiness.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.530
As for love and hate—

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.240
I don't know what to say.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.560
What kind of feeling is this?

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.240
Leader.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.600
This is relief.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.630
Let me think about it.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.190
Leader, take your time.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.990
Shen, what should we do?

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.270
Everyone thinks

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.920
it's not the right time to save Foxy Tang.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.410
[Tingyun Pavilion]

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.190
And that Xifang Tao—

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.590
she refuses to say
where the Plum Garden is.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.590
There's someone

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.950
who might know.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.800
Who?

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.480
Bai Suche?

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.480
Once she tells you,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.180
send me a message immediately.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.940
And let's

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.350
set out together.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.050
How does it feel?

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.040
Does avenging

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.920
bring you joy?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.230
People's emotions
are really unpredictable.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.480
Tomorrow will be Tang Lici's

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.390
last day.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.760
Aren't you staying with Tang Lici?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.850
These last two days,

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.070
I don't want to see him.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.650
Leader, you don't understand.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.650
I don't.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.750
I hate him,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.040
I love him,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.240
and I resent him.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.860
I'm afraid I won't bear to do it,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.230
and I hate myself for that.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.160
The closer his death comes,

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.270
the stronger

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.260
this feeling becomes.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.750
Leader, tomorrow you will take

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.950
Tang Lici's body?

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.720
Actually,

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.950
it's Yique Yinyang's.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.870
I'm just an executor.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.130
If Yique Yinyang descends,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.680
you will be replaced by him,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.870
just like Tang Lici.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.240
So tomorrow will be

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.560
your last day too.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.550
I feel sorry for you.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:57.940
It's meaningless

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.310
to pity me.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.390
You have curiosity,

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.960
but unfortunately,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.270
you have no feelings.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.040
You know neither love nor hate,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.750
neither joy nor anger,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.770
and neither fear

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.320
nor excitement.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.190
It's a pity,

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.360
but puppets cannot feel it.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.270
All your short life,

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.740
you've been trying to experience,

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.240
desperately trying
to grasp what human emotions are.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.830
I suppose all of this

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.980
wasn't Yique Yinyang's command.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.830
If you were only a puppet,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.920
how could you have thoughts

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.780
beyond what your master ordered?

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.040
It's not that you can't think of

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.040
a name for the cat—

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.190
you just don't dare

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.120
to have anything

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.720
truly your own in this world.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.560
A puppet found itself

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.600
when dying.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.930
I guess now

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.300
you finally understand

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.120
what human regret

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.120
feels like.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.010
I'm going to deliver food to Mr. Tang.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.060
Leader asked you to eat.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.090
I've tidied up after you so many times.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.530
After you finish today,

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.210
clean up yourself.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:57.480
Miss Shui,

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.910
why did you ask to see me

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.240
at this hour?

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.200
Is the Sword Alliance really not going to

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.080
save Tang Lici?

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.840
We will, but right now...

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.320
Bad news. Something bad happened.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.000
Shen Langhun and Chi Yun are both missing.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.960
They must have gone

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.960
to find the Plum Garden on their own.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.900
Then I'll go look for them.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.690
We need to find them,

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.270
but you need to stay
in charge of the rear.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.510
There's something suspicious

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.370
about Little Fox's injury this time.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.960
I need you to investigate.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:35.730
Your Highness,

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.840
Master Shao requests an audience.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.790
Invite him in.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.170
Chunji.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.600
Master.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.440
You don't look well.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.300
What happened?

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.840
I'm a bit tired.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.320
Master, please have a seat.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.030
Okay.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.840
Just in time,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.170
I made your favorite tea today.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.670
Really?

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.030
Master, what did you

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.390
want to see me for?

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.620
I had something to discuss,

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.630
but now that I see you,

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.430
it's nothing.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.390
After I went back,

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.150
I thought about what really happened

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.550
the day Mr. Tang got hurt.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.790
Didn't I tell you

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.410
I was controlled by Liu Yan?

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.650
I don't know why

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.270
I ended up stabbing Mr. Tang.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.960
Why did you have that needle?

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.600
Liu Yan controlled me.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.910
I don't even know

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.990
how the needle ended up on me.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.870
Master,

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.100
you suspect me?

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.360
Chunji,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.550
you like Mr. Tang?

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.410
Yes.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.150
Since you like him,

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.360
why did you do that?

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.040
Master, why do you still not believe me?

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.570
With your personality,

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.830
if you really had a clear conscience,

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.790
you wouldn't feel guilty

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.270
or tormented over this.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.790
Making a mistake in a moment
isn't a problem.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.240
But you have to admit it.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.130
I did nothing wrong.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.150
Chunji.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.550
You don't understand Mr. Tang at all.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.510
You have no idea

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.910
how exhausted he is.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.320
He's doing something

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.550
that's impossible.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.870
No one is protecting him,

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.960
no one ever stopped him,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.020
and no one has told him

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.800
he doesn't have to live so heavily.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.160
Everyone is using him,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.760
using him to get revenge,

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.600
to destroy Fengliu Shop.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.680
Have you ever thought about

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.860
how heavy the burden on his shoulders

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:15.740
really is?

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.270
Only I understand him.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.730
If you really think you did nothing wrong,

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.320
why didn't you go save him?

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.910
I know that with your personality,

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.240
if you know Mr. Tang is in danger,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.440
you will do everything possible

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.200
to bring him back.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.550
The reason you didn't

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.510
isn't that you don't want to.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:32.390
It's that you don't know

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.080
how to face Mr. Tang.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.120
But I'm trying to make up for it.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.240
If I hadn't requested reinforcements

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.360
from the court,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.080
how could we have achieved
a complete victory

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.680
in the Battle of Mount Cloud?

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:53.720
Master.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.010
please help me keep this a secret.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.660
You want me to keep it a secret?

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.060
If others find out,

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.770
no one will understand me.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.810
You're such a silly disciple.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.170
Silly disciple.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.030
Master.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.380
Why is it that when others make mistakes,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.160
they don't always get punished,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.120
but when I make a mistake,

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.550
I have to suffer?

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.520
You are a princess.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.450
Apart from His Majesty,

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.510
no one dares make you suffer.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.030
What about before I became a princess?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.270
The Sword Alliance

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.720
was never fair to me.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.760
Chunji,

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:04.790
do you remember

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.050
what I told you before?

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.650
Be a good person and do good deeds—

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.330
even if it costs you something,

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.550
you can still be at peace.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.600
There's nothing unfair about that,

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.090
because I want you

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.600
to always be a good person.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.370
Your Highness.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.520
What is it now?

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.320
It concerns the dignity
of the royal family.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.320
Your reputation is very important.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:11.360
If someone wants to

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.960
to tarnish your reputation,

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.720
that is treason.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.160
What do you mean?

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.630
My family
has been generals for generations,

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.830
guarding the palace.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.390
The emperor of the previous dynasty
was incompetent,

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.910
and now His Majesty has taken the throne.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.030
I've heard many things

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.490
that shouldn't be spoken,

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.070
but in the end,

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.350
none of them were actually said.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.750
I will not allow anyone

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.750
to hurt my master!

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.580
I will go apologize to him.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.760
If you dare harm my master,

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.200
I'll cut your head off.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.000
Yes.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.550
These past few days, apart from eating,

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.670
the Ghostly Peony has kept

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.800
putting me to sleep.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.270
Waking me now

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.480
must mean he's ready.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.840
I said I wouldn't see him tonight,

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.390
but somehow

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.590
I still wound up here.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.320
You are a cat in the Plum Garden.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.800
You should be smart.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.000
Why do you eat

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.530
whatever anyone gives you?

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:56.630
Because it's you.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.000
Even if it's poison,

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.270
it would eat it.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.750
You and Fang Zhou

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.290
have the same talent.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.010
You already know?

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.160
Shei,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.510
I'm dying.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.000
You're not an orphan.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.880
You have an older brother

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.270
still alive.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.040
He's Fang Zhou, Chief of Zhoudi Tower

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.920
in Jiangnan.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.550
After I'm gone,

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.270
go find him.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.070
Madam,

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.240
could you tell me

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.730
how to get to Zhoudi Tower?

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.000
You asked the right person.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.070
Let me tell you.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.800
Head that way

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.200
toward Mount Li.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.270
The place you're looking for

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.530
is up on that mountain.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.240
Thank you, Madam.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.170
You're welcome.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.790
Miss.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.590
Are you going to Zhoudi Tower

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680
for something

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.590
or to look for someone?

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:54.720
No.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:56.930
Who are you?

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.480
I'm Fang Zhou.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.270
Miss?

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.920
Are you okay?

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.640
Luckily,

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.080
it's just a sprain,

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.080
nothing serious.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.560
But you should be careful when walking

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.690
these next few days.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.990
You were asking about
Zhoudi Tower earlier.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.450
Why do you want to go there?

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.160
I just...

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.240
read about it in a book

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.350
and got curious,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.510
so I asked a few questions.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.750
Is that so?

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:07.310
Thank you.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.680
I'll be going now.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:10.830
Wait.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:13.720
Miss,

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.000
may I know your name?

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:20.370
I...

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:21.690
Shei?

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.240
You're Shei?

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.290
Brother.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.050
It's really you?

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.310
Brother,

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.270
it's me.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.480
I'm Shei.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.580
Now that we've finally reunited,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.400
that's the greatest joy.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.930
Being able to see you again,

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.570
I have no more regrets.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.480
I have a lot

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.210
to tell you,

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.200
but there is something

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.220
that is at a critical point right now.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:16.660
Shei,

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.070
stay nearby for now.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.580
After half a month,

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.750
come find me in Zhoudi Tower.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.700
If I'm still there by then...

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.400
What do you mean?

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.090
If I happen to be away

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.790
by then,

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.800
go find Lici and the others.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.070
Tell them

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440
you're my sister,

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.090
and they'll let you in.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:39.880
Okay.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.160
I'm so happy to see you.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:45.980
You know,

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.960
[Half a month later]

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.160
I have two juniors

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.000
I'd like to introduce you to.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.070
I'm happy too.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.490
What happened

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.120
in the past half a month?

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:25.180
I lost my family again.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.010
Instead of listening to my story here,

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.400
shouldn't you be figuring out

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.200
how to get out of the Plum Garden?

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.530
Why should I escape?

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.550
What I need to do

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.070
isn't finished yet.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.270
The time for Yique Yinyang's resurrection

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.070
is coming.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.880
Mr. Tang, do you have any last wishes?

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.940
I'll try my best to fulfill them.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.760
I've been thinking—

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.880
Tuo Dragon
relies on the power of Tianren Realm

00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.590
to survive.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.710
When it came to Shenzhou,

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.590
it was like a fish out of water.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.480
So why is it still able to use its power?

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:08.850
Now I finally understand.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.350
It's you

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.000
who has been continuously

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.060
feeding energy into the bronze tree.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.880
It's those black crystals.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.960
What a pity, Mr. Tang.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.400
If it weren't for the fact that the timing

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.720
of Yique Yinyang's resurrection
cannot be missed,

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.350
I would have learned more

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.720
from you.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.070
Those who take the Blood Ghost Pill

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.640
will produce a black crystal

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.840
called Black Tuli inside their bodies.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.880
It's the best nourishment
for the bronze tree.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.400
Now there's enough of it.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.460
As long as we get your body,

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.550
Yique Yinyang

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.000
can be resurrected.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.750
Well, since it's my body,

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:52.640
who will survive in the end—

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.720
me,

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.720
you,

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.880
or Yique Yinyang?

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.120
It will be

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.160
a combination of me and Yique Yinyang.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.490
He'll have my memories,

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.250
and your consciousness

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.070
will be erased.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.440
Why is your consciousness
not the one being erased?

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.160
You don't know how to appreciate
the delicacies of the human world,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.760
nor do you know what you live for.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.890
How do you like them?

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:21.570
All these dishes are good.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.680
But I don't understand
what makes them good.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.310
Your memories

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:26.790
are useless to him,

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:28.440
because

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.200
you're just a puppet.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.830
Therefore,

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:33.930
once he awakens,

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.400
you will end up

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.810
vanishing into nothing.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.720
You are right.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.470
Since you don't want to lose your body,

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.640
and I don't want to lose my consciousness,

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.920
we can work together.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.400
Inside the bronze tree,

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.240
there's a Sky-Fallen Stone

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.160
that traveled here with you.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.340
Through it,

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.270
we can trace back through time.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.660
Let's go back to the world's origin

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.350
and kill Yique Yinyang.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.710
You really are

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.400
a presumptuous puppet.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.350
However,

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.310
once I reach Tianren Realm,

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.770
my power will be restored.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.750
Aren't you afraid I'll turn around

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:24.680
and kill you?

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.960
Also,

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.900
why don't you go yourself?

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.620
That's a good question.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.030
I've thought about it

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:36.590
before.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.030
But that's Tianren Realm.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.290
It's heavily guarded.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.510
If we work together,

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.310
nothing can go wrong.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:48.350
Is this reason

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.160
good enough?

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.830
I'll trust you this once.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:59.940
I'll send you back to the moment

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.200
before Ye Mo escaped from Tianren Realm.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.360
Are you ready?

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.520
You'd better not play tricks.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.590
[Tianren Realm]

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:22.610
Tianren Realm?

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.310
I'm back.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.920
The power of the Rebirth Scroll

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.010
has also returned.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.580
The bone-washing silver bracelet is gone?

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.740
Ye Mo,

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.180
where are you?

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:51.410
Holy Son!

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.880
This child

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.640
is a miracle created with the power

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.700
of the entire realm

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.110
and also our last chance.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.650
He will end the Tianren Five Declines

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:05.000
and save everyone.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.230
She is Ye Mo's mother?

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.320
The Holy Son is about to be born.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.820
I will guard the Qi-gathering Formation

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.640
and will not leave the tower.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:20.830
Holy Son!

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:21.960
Goddess, take care.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.110
So

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.350
Ye Mo is not born yet.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.150
Escort the Goddess back to Guanxing Tower.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.480
What's...

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:47.860
wrong with me?

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.670
Greetings, Goddess.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.010
Goddess,
thank you for carrying the Holy Fetus.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.830
She is so respected.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.110
Why is there

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.110
no record of her

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:09.350
in the Tianren Realm's

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:10.480
scripture scrolls?

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.590
Could it be that after Ye Mo was born,

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.590
she disappeared?

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.960
And even traces of her existence

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.880
were erased?

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:17.880
Wait.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.030
The medicines for the Goddess

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.230
must be handled with care.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:23.990
I'll check them first.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.180
You've got some nerve.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.170
As a General of Guanxing Tower,

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.980
how dare you steal while on duty?

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.300
Don't act smart in front of me.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.270
Or I'll strip you of your powers.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.400
Got it?

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.790
What are you talking about?

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:13.880
Still acting?

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.160
Stop pretending.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.960
Stealing offerings is a serious crime.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:22.610
What...

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.510
What are you talking about?

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.360
Please spare my life.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.000
I am the leader of the Garuda Clan.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.640
I was ordered to guard Guanxing Tower.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.350
I was wrong

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.050
to steal the offerings.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.350
I'm really sorry.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.090
Then why did you steal the offerings?

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.590
Since the Tianren Five Declines began,

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.850
everyone has changed.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.410
People can actually grow old.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.210
I am the leader of Jinyu Tribe,

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.790
only 300 years old,

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.950
yet I already look like this.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.110
Many of my people have died.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.350
Now we can only wait
for the Holy Son to be born

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.440
and end the Tianren Five Declines

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.570
so we can stop aging.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:08.480
Until then,

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.200
we can only sustain ourselves
by secretly eating offerings.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.830
Outside the Tianren Realm,

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.680
humans

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.400
naturally grow old.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.960
My Lord, have you been to Shenzhou?

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.830
I heard the people there

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.490
live in peace and prosperity.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.720
Is that true?

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.920
Yes.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:33.590
Now, Shenzhou

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:34.790
is still full of life.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.270
The Yique Yinyang Rebellion
hasn't happened.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:38.070
If I can

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.470
kill Yique Yinyang here,

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:40.880
everyone will survive,

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.600
including Fang Zhou.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.310
I am the divine official

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:46.770
in charge of criminal law.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.030
I was ordered by the Asura King

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:50.230
to investigate the missing offerings.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.640
I tracked the fugitive Ghostly Peony here

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.200
to investigate his whereabouts.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.310
Stealing offerings is a serious crime.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.350
If you don't want to die of old age

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:58.330
in the heavenly prison,

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:59.440
then listen to me.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.200
Give me the golden elixir first.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.110
Yes.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.270
Go to the library now

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.900
and look something up for me.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.320
I have other arrangements.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:37.250
My Lord,

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.240
I'll use our secret method to talk to you.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.570
It won't cause trouble.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.440
The current Goddess

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.240
was chosen from the Dragon Clan.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.010
They can control the dragons.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.440
Every day at midnight,
the Goddess begins meditating

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.100
to absorb the Tianren Realm's energy

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.900
in order to nurture the Holy Son.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.200
After giving birth to the Holy Son,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.400
the Goddess will die

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.260
due to the depletion of her power.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:58.850
So the birth of the Holy Son

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.750
is actually his mother's calamity,

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:01.610
whether he is me

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.590
or Ye Mo.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.830
Do you suspect

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.000
that Ghostly Peony
has sneaked into Guanxing Tower

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.500
and that the Goddess might be in danger?

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.980
Focus on your task.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.640
Find out the truth

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.960
about that.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.870
I was sent by Lord Garuda

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.830
to deliver the missing offerings.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:19.150
Are you worried?

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:31.750
Am I the only one

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.630
who can hear this voice?

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:35.110
Take it.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.870
Don't be so nervous.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.200
Could she

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.720
have sensed

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.180
my emotional disturbance

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.080
and thought I intended
to seize the offerings?

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:49.920
You can leave now.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:57.310
Wait.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.060
You stay here.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.200
Guardian goddesses,

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.460
I don't need your protection right now.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.590
You may leave now.

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:12.880
Yes.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.240
You shouldn't be here.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.790
It gets cold at night.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.390
What about you?

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.130
Aren't you cold?

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:49.960
I...

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:52.000
I'm used to it.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.920
This is where
the heavenly wall is thinnest.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.670
It's the only place in Tianren Realm

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:59.320
where one can see the stars.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.720
I like it here.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:04.940
Look.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:06.720
Stars

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.699
can see everyone's fate.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.630
Even your child's?

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.199
I never looked at him.

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:19.719
If I do,

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.260
I'll become obsessed.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.230
Kid,

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.150
come here.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.960
This is the swaddling cloth

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.420
I made for my unborn child.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.050
It can keep you warm.

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:44.699
It gets very cold here at night.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.880
Put it on.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:51.360
I'm not cold.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.110
I'm not a kid either.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.800
It's time.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.170
I'll begin my meditation.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:05.890
The Dragon Goddess
is about to begin her meditation.

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:07.320
Call the guards at once

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.380
to join us in guarding the formation.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:24.450
I didn't expect

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:25.800
Ye Mo's mother

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:27.190
to be so kind.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.030
Why do I feel

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.740
something strange when I see her?

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.340
My Lord.

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:44.210
Did you find it?

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:45.150
Yes.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.880
This secret scroll records

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.000
a hidden cultivation art of Tianren Realm,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.880
the Soul Transfer Technique.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.210
It sounds just like the one you described.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.930
I'm not looking, I'm not looking.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:00.420
Open the Heaven Halo,

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.160
channel the energy of the earth veins,

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.410
and use the power of the Rebirth Scroll

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:04.670
to cleanse the miasma.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.960
As expected,

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.880
the Heaven-Halo Technique
is the Soul Transfer Technique.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.550
When cast upon heaven and earth,

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.350
it can purify the world's filth.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.600
When used on a person,

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:16.190
it can disrupt

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.090
or stabilize their energy flow

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:19.880
and even process their body

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.030
when their energy

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.260
is in chaos.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.050
Heaven-Halo Technique

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:27.910
is the key to restarting the soul.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.210
What will happen

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.550
if I use it

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.840
on Ghostly Peony?

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.070
Come out.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.610
Don't worry.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.210
I've sent them all away.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:02.630
You knew I would come again?

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:04.560
Aren't you afraid I might hurt you?

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:06.670
I don't know why,

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.150
but I feel

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.720
a strange familiarity with you.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.710
And I can sense

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:15.880
that you mean me no harm.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.760
Do you want to see the stars tonight?

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.800
Since yesterday,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.200
I've been regretting

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:25.620
that you didn't see

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.100
this beautiful sky.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.710
It's only as wide as a well opening here,

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.670
but the starry sky I've seen before

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.030
filled the whole world.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.150
Really?

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.440
I'm so happy for you,

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.200
kid.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.630
I told you.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.360
I'm not a kid.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:55.760
Stop calling me kid.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:00.890
I was wrong.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.850
You're no longer a kid.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.020
I shouldn't call you that.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.280
Then your mother

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.230
must have been happy

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.400
to watch you grow up.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:16.480
Not everyone
has their mother by their side

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.760
as they grow,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.030
and not everyone

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.010
is meant to become a mother.

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:24.150
As the leader of the Dragon Clan,

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:26.350
your cultivation is a path of solitude.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.110
Yet now,

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:28.840
you've formed a bond

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.900
with another life.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.960
Because of this child,

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.920
every time the midnight bell tolls,

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:36.630
you're frozen in ice,

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.110
becoming

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.520
the most fragile person in this world.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:41.440
He...

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:42.930
is harming you.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.440
I don't think so.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.920
On the contrary, it's because of him

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.010
that I've seen a greater

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.130
and more beautiful sky.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:18.560
How ridiculous.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.880
The starry sky you speak of

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.440
is no bigger than the opening of a well.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.300
For that tiny patch of starry sky,

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:25.880
you've destroyed countless others' chance

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.110
to see it.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:28.580
You all think

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.770
he's the savior.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.440
But you don't know

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.480
that once he's born,

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.710
he'll fall into darkness
and become a devil.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.150
Not only will he kill you,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.060
erasing you from the world's memory,

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.800
but he'll also cause chaos in Shenzhou

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.350
and bring endless calamities

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:47.140
to the people there.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.920
Let me tell you,

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.480
your child's name

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:08.230
is Ye Mo.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.630
The reason I came here...

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.920
is...

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.590
Wait.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.220
Ye Mo isn't my child.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.280
Didn't he...

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.590
leave the Tianren Realm

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.440
years ago?

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.070
The name

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.150
I gave my child

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.300
is Ajibanr Tang Jia.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:39.320
Holy Son.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.880
This child

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:43.440
is a miracle

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.510
created with the power
of the entire realm.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.590
He will end the Tianren Five Declines

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:49.850
and save everyone!

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:52.480
I don't know why,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:53.840
but I feel

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.090
a strange familiarity with you.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:57.540
Kid.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:59.110
What's your name?

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.290
Ajibanr

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:01.670
Tang Jia.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:03.550
We meet again,

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:07.190
Ajibanr Tang Jia.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:15.280
It looks like

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.060
I'm not the person you're looking for.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.650
Because Ye Mo left,

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.210
I was chosen as the Goddess.

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:23.030
And my child

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.110
will become the new Holy Son.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:27.310
The moment he's born,

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.170
he must leave the tower to cultivate.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:31.360
And I

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.540
will never be able to leave this prison.

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:37.540
I'm destined never to meet him

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:40.070
or watch him grow.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.170
And I will never have the chance

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:44.000
to know

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:45.610
what kind of person

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.480
my child will become.

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.110
I hope he knows

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.000
that his birth

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.190
is not a calamity.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.030
He'll be born

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:00.440
with his mother's love,

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:02.710
coming into the world

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.970
through decay and decline.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.190
This is a magical artifact

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:17.990
nurtured with the Dragon Pearl,

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.000
the bone-washing silver bracelet,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.810
kept for my unborn child.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.760
If you ever meet him,

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.230
please give it to him.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:52.450
Are you okay?

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.840
The Goddess got attacked!

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.100
Capture the assassin!

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:56.080
Go!

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:09.520
The energy of Tianren Realm
is about to overflow.

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:10.900
Come with me.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.230
I can save you.

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:16.570
Go.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:23.180
Catch the assassin!

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.320
Tang Lici, are you crazy?

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.550
I'm trying to kill Yique Yinyang.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:43.510
A few pieces of wood

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.840
want to be human?

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.200
Die!

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.550
Mother.
