DYNAMITE KISS

00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:46.628
EPISODE 2

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:50.548
This is insane.

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.009
Just insane.

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:55.511
What should I do now?

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:59.057
Right. Should I just run away?

00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:03.228
Seriously, what have I done?

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.148
Why did I do that?

00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:09.067
But it was nice…

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.402
No. Pull yourself together.

00:02:12.237 --> 00:02:13.154
Stop it.

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.082
Oh my.

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:25.792
Looks like someone needs
a little pick-me-up.

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:29.128
You must've given it your all, huh?

00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:33.258
What?

00:02:33.883 --> 00:02:35.426
Hey, Da-rim!

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:37.053
You're back.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.308
Well, don't you look completely drained.

00:02:42.392 --> 00:02:44.185
What are you talking about?

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.980
You've had one too many drinks.
Drink some water.

00:02:48.314 --> 00:02:49.232
Darn it.

00:02:58.074 --> 00:02:59.117
It's dance time!

00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:05.707
Jeong-gwon, let's get out there.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.834
You can't even stand straight right now.

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:08.835
Come on!

00:03:09.502 --> 00:03:12.672
Do you really not feel anything
after seeing this hot and heavy couple?

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.054
All right.

00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:22.557
Shall we go and dance then?

00:03:25.727 --> 00:03:27.437
You should join us.

00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:35.319
Sure.

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:39.907
Let's go.

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:18.738
You were right.

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.074
I can tell that Kim Jeong-gwon

00:04:21.866 --> 00:04:22.825
is suspicious of us.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.038
Don't look.

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:29.999
I guess we're visibly awkward
around each other.

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:32.043
Just follow my lead.

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:46.474
Excuse me for a moment.

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:53.059
Don't bother.

00:06:53.142 --> 00:06:54.852
Your mouth gets dry when you're nervous.

00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:01.442
Let go of me.

00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:03.736
Wearing a dress that doesn't suit you,
and even dancing.

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:05.488
You're really putting in the effort.

00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:06.822
Do you want to let all that go to waste?

00:07:07.406 --> 00:07:10.743
-What?
-Well, it wasn't entirely ineffective.

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:13.913
Seeing you go so far as to kiss
another man to get my attention

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:16.165
sure got me fired up.

00:07:19.418 --> 00:07:20.294
Meet me later tonight.

00:07:20.378 --> 00:07:21.462
What?

00:07:21.546 --> 00:07:24.632
I'm giving you a chance
for old times' sake.

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:26.467
I'll get us a room and text you.

00:07:29.637 --> 00:07:31.973
It looks like you've become

00:07:32.056 --> 00:07:35.685
a complete asshole since I last saw you.

00:07:37.103 --> 00:07:38.896
I'm done associating with you.

00:07:40.106 --> 00:07:42.400
I've become part of the elite,

00:07:42.984 --> 00:07:45.236
important enough
for that boyfriend of yours

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:46.779
to jump through hoops
in hopes of scouting me.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.865
The more cooperative you are
with my proposal,

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:52.660
the more I'll be open

00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:55.413
to that scouting proposal of his.

00:07:55.997 --> 00:07:57.540
So let's strive for mutual aid.

00:07:58.165 --> 00:07:59.625
You'll make some money yourself too.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.420
You asshole.

00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:05.590
That's enough playing hard to get.
Admit it. You like it too.

00:08:05.673 --> 00:08:06.924
You're insane.

00:08:07.008 --> 00:08:08.134
Let go. Let go of me!

00:08:13.306 --> 00:08:14.724
Damn it. What the hell?

00:08:14.807 --> 00:08:17.643
Do you even know how much
this mistake is going to cost you?

00:08:17.727 --> 00:08:18.603
I don't.

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:24.650
Hey, I thought you said one trillion.

00:08:24.734 --> 00:08:26.277
Is a trillion a joke to you, asshole?

00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:30.323
Even if it were for 100 trillion,

00:08:31.824 --> 00:08:33.743
I wouldn't work with scum like you.

00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:38.289
Leave.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.765
Goddamn it!

00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:04.899
All done.

00:09:07.693 --> 00:09:08.903
Thanks.

00:09:09.904 --> 00:09:12.406
-Is your wrist okay?
-I'm fine.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.826
But I'm worried
that your wound might get worse.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.663
It's just been treated.

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:23.834
I'm sorry.

00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:26.962
I wasn't of much help, was I?

00:09:30.341 --> 00:09:31.759
You were.

00:09:32.468 --> 00:09:34.095
Working with people like him

00:09:34.804 --> 00:09:36.180
only leads to bigger problems.

00:09:41.852 --> 00:09:44.188
But he's still someone I once loved.

00:09:45.189 --> 00:09:46.774
It's a bit disheartening.

00:09:48.317 --> 00:09:49.485
You were mistaken.

00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:51.821
You mistook it for love.

00:09:53.197 --> 00:09:55.449
Does real love even exist to begin with?

00:09:55.533 --> 00:09:57.368
Come on. That's taking it too far.

00:09:58.035 --> 00:09:59.620
Of course, real love exists.

00:10:00.204 --> 00:10:02.206
It definitely exists.

00:10:03.374 --> 00:10:04.375
It's just that

00:10:05.126 --> 00:10:09.380
there are people who fail to protect it
until the end.

00:10:25.646 --> 00:10:26.772
What is that?

00:10:33.028 --> 00:10:34.697
It's so pretty.

00:10:36.073 --> 00:10:37.533
The water is glowing.

00:10:40.286 --> 00:10:41.537
It's so pretty.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.955
It's bioluminescent plankton.

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:44.957
When they are stimulated by waves
or external factors,

00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:47.752
they get startled and emit a blue light.

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:50.296
I see. That's so cool.

00:10:53.674 --> 00:10:54.717
It's like an aurora.

00:10:56.218 --> 00:10:57.845
It's so pretty.

00:11:40.638 --> 00:11:42.473
I got too excited, didn't I?

00:11:43.182 --> 00:11:44.767
I didn't even do enough
to earn this dress,

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.851
and I got all excited for nothing.

00:11:46.685 --> 00:11:47.895
So, maybe we should

00:11:49.355 --> 00:11:50.898
remain a couple for one more day.

00:11:51.482 --> 00:11:53.901
Oh, is there someone else
you're looking to scout?

00:11:54.735 --> 00:11:58.030
But I'm sure you already noticed
that I'm terrible at acting.

00:11:58.697 --> 00:11:59.782
That's not true.

00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:03.953
You were excellent.
It was as if we were a real couple.

00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:05.496
You kissed me, and…

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:08.499
I did that because I was pushed into it
out of urgency.

00:12:08.582 --> 00:12:10.292
It was an emergency.

00:12:10.376 --> 00:12:11.835
An extension of our deal, if you will.

00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:15.714
Plus, you did it to me too.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.261
I didn't do it for our deal.

00:12:21.804 --> 00:12:22.680
What?

00:12:23.597 --> 00:12:25.015
I did it for personal reasons.

00:12:26.934 --> 00:12:28.811
I'd like to spend the day
with you tomorrow.

00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:30.813
Not professionally,

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.774
but very much personally.

00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:44.118
Well…

00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:46.537
Then…

00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:48.247
Are you--

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.665
Let's go on a date.

00:13:09.143 --> 00:13:10.978
I can't believe he asked me out.

00:13:11.061 --> 00:13:12.646
This is insane!

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.861
"I didn't do it for our deal."

00:13:18.944 --> 00:13:20.279
"I did it for personal reasons."

00:13:21.155 --> 00:13:22.906
He did it for personal reasons!

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.742
Oh my gosh!

00:13:26.952 --> 00:13:28.037
Hold on.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.288
What should I wear tomorrow?

00:13:46.805 --> 00:13:48.557
HOW TO KISS WELL

00:13:53.687 --> 00:13:57.274
GYEONG-MIN

00:14:00.319 --> 00:14:02.446
Hey, Ji-hyeok. How did it go?

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.282
What do you think the perfect kiss is?

00:14:05.366 --> 00:14:07.576
What? What was that?

00:14:08.243 --> 00:14:09.203
A kiss…

00:14:10.412 --> 00:14:12.247
is when two souls intertwine

00:14:12.956 --> 00:14:14.625
to become one.

00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:17.670
Just like when nitric acid
and sulfuric acid combine,

00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:19.588
like dynamite.

00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:22.049
Boom.

00:14:22.549 --> 00:14:24.426
Did you kiss Kim Jeong-gwon?

00:14:27.054 --> 00:14:29.181
Do you seriously want a beating?

00:14:30.391 --> 00:14:32.059
That punk is a total scum.

00:14:32.142 --> 00:14:33.143
He's out.

00:14:33.227 --> 00:14:35.354
So you didn't get him.

00:14:35.437 --> 00:14:37.940
Get back here now.
We need to do damage control.

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:41.819
I'll take care of Hassan, so don't worry.

00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:48.325
I should be pursuing
someone else right now.

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:50.077
What? Who?

00:14:51.245 --> 00:14:52.079
Someone.

00:14:54.123 --> 00:14:55.708
Anyhow, I won't be back tomorrow.

00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:56.792
Bye.

00:15:04.133 --> 00:15:06.010
Why is the sun taking forever to rise?

00:15:30.451 --> 00:15:32.536
-Ta-da!
-Look over here!

00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:33.454
DADDY LOVES YOU

00:15:33.537 --> 00:15:34.455
MOMMY LOVES YOU

00:15:37.207 --> 00:15:39.334
Can you look over here?

00:15:39.418 --> 00:15:40.335
Look at that.

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:45.007
That's great. Just one more.
Look over here.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.133
Great.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.843
Look over here.

00:15:49.845 --> 00:15:51.680
-One more time.
-Look over there.

00:15:51.764 --> 00:15:52.890
Look over here.

00:15:54.641 --> 00:15:55.517
Smile!

00:15:57.895 --> 00:15:58.896
Good job today.

00:16:03.692 --> 00:16:06.153
A chairman is expected to do
all sorts of things nowadays.

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:09.281
But still, it's bound
to be a great exposure.

00:16:09.364 --> 00:16:11.658
The video of you
changing a baby's diaper went viral,

00:16:11.742 --> 00:16:13.118
and it led to 10,000 more followers.

00:16:13.202 --> 00:16:15.120
Interview requests
are flooding in as well.

00:16:15.204 --> 00:16:16.163
That's true.

00:16:17.414 --> 00:16:18.248
Anyway, what's that?

00:16:18.332 --> 00:16:20.793
A five-year strategy plan
for overseas expansion.

00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:23.087
CHAIRMAN GONG CHANG-HO

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.506
Wow, this is so thorough.

00:16:25.589 --> 00:16:26.757
We just talked about it.

00:16:27.633 --> 00:16:29.093
I'm your daughter, after all.

00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:38.477
It's time for Natural BeBe

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.688
to become the number one in baby products,
not just in Asia but in the world.

00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:44.733
In Europe, South America, and even Africa.

00:16:47.402 --> 00:16:50.572
I think it'll be more than possible
with the right distribution network.

00:16:51.198 --> 00:16:52.533
That's the issue in the end.

00:16:54.118 --> 00:16:56.870
How about working with Chairman Yu
of Taeyu C&T?

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:01.875
They're already partnered up
with another company.

00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:04.294
Do you think
they'd even consider working with us?

00:17:04.378 --> 00:17:07.548
That's why I decided to marry off Ji-hyeok
to Chairman Yu's daughter.

00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:08.757
What? Marry…

00:17:10.092 --> 00:17:11.301
Marriage?

00:17:39.746 --> 00:17:40.831
Hello, Ms. Yu.

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.170
Our pieces are so luxurious, aren't they?

00:17:46.253 --> 00:17:47.504
Of course, they are.

00:17:47.588 --> 00:17:49.798
The director has quite the gorgeous,
discerning eye for art.

00:17:51.383 --> 00:17:52.467
That's the issue.

00:17:52.551 --> 00:17:53.594
Gorgeous.

00:17:54.428 --> 00:17:56.138
This is all so my mom's taste.

00:17:56.221 --> 00:17:57.890
What's the issue with that?

00:17:57.973 --> 00:17:59.016
It's intimidating.

00:17:59.099 --> 00:18:01.018
When you look at these works,

00:18:01.101 --> 00:18:04.271
you feel like you have to be better,
make more money,

00:18:04.354 --> 00:18:06.481
and wear expensive clothes.

00:18:06.565 --> 00:18:09.026
That sense of luxury
is our art hall's mission.

00:18:09.109 --> 00:18:11.570
That's why our audience demographic
remains limited.

00:18:11.653 --> 00:18:15.699
Can't we be a bit not luxurious
and not gorgeous?

00:18:16.283 --> 00:18:20.454
I'd love to hold an exhibition
that brings peace to its viewers.

00:18:21.455 --> 00:18:22.539
Perhaps one reminiscent

00:18:22.623 --> 00:18:24.041
of a mom's homemade

00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:26.793
kimchi stew?

00:18:38.096 --> 00:18:39.556
-Wait.
-Wait.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.391
-Good job. Here you go.
-Oh no.

00:19:57.467 --> 00:19:58.635
Excuse me.

00:19:58.719 --> 00:20:00.429
Do you mind stepping aside a bit?

00:20:01.346 --> 00:20:02.180
Sure.

00:20:02.264 --> 00:20:04.057
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.152
The air is so crisp.

00:20:15.652 --> 00:20:17.362
It feels like
a weight's been lifted off my chest.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.448
Was there a lot bottled up?

00:20:20.198 --> 00:20:21.658
Yes, a lot.

00:20:22.701 --> 00:20:25.662
If I'm being honest,
I've been a hermit for the last few years.

00:20:26.246 --> 00:20:28.290
It's been a long time since I traveled.

00:20:28.874 --> 00:20:30.792
For years? Why?

00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:32.336
The exam I've been…

00:20:35.797 --> 00:20:36.798
No, what I meant was,

00:20:37.466 --> 00:20:39.718
I'm dealing with some family issues.

00:20:40.802 --> 00:20:44.931
Those issues basically pushed me
into taking this trip as well.

00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:46.183
What sort of family issues?

00:20:48.435 --> 00:20:50.312
That tree looks so amazing.

00:20:53.315 --> 00:20:56.318
It's just as amazing as the
Grandfather Tree in my neighborhood.

00:20:58.612 --> 00:20:59.946
"Grandfather Tree"?

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:00.864
Yes.

00:21:00.947 --> 00:21:02.366
It's a local landmark.

00:21:02.866 --> 00:21:04.785
I visit it whenever I feel stressed.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.914
There's a small store next to it,

00:21:08.997 --> 00:21:12.417
so I get myself a chocolate ice cream
and eat it underneath the tree.

00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:15.253
It somehow helps soothe my troubles.

00:21:20.092 --> 00:21:21.051
I'm envious.

00:21:22.135 --> 00:21:23.678
I don't have a place like that.

00:21:27.015 --> 00:21:27.933
A patch of clover.

00:21:28.683 --> 00:21:29.518
Oh my.

00:21:30.435 --> 00:21:31.645
Let's see.

00:21:35.357 --> 00:21:37.150
Let's see now.

00:21:42.614 --> 00:21:43.824
I found one.

00:21:43.907 --> 00:21:46.493
Look, I found one!

00:21:47.828 --> 00:21:48.870
A four-leaf clover.

00:21:54.626 --> 00:21:55.502
Here.

00:21:56.962 --> 00:21:58.880
-What?
-Take it.

00:22:02.801 --> 00:22:03.718
You're giving it to me?

00:22:04.344 --> 00:22:05.887
-Yes.
-Why don't you keep it?

00:22:06.596 --> 00:22:07.764
You worked hard to find it.

00:22:09.224 --> 00:22:10.851
I've already found my luck.

00:22:12.102 --> 00:22:13.186
You, Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:22:22.612 --> 00:22:23.780
Kim Jeong-gwon

00:22:23.864 --> 00:22:27.117
has long been a thorn in my side.

00:22:27.659 --> 00:22:29.703
Thanks to you, I got my sweet revenge.

00:22:30.203 --> 00:22:31.955
I couldn't wish for better luck.

00:22:32.038 --> 00:22:35.584
So you should be the one to take this.

00:22:47.012 --> 00:22:48.597
Do you have a wish?

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.223
One that requires luck?

00:22:56.688 --> 00:22:57.647
A wish…

00:22:58.773 --> 00:22:59.691
Not right now.

00:23:00.525 --> 00:23:01.651
But…

00:23:02.235 --> 00:23:03.278
I might have one soon.

00:23:07.449 --> 00:23:08.867
Wait for me!

00:23:10.619 --> 00:23:11.661
Are you sure

00:23:11.745 --> 00:23:13.330
you can just hang out like this?

00:23:13.914 --> 00:23:15.373
We failed our mission yesterday.

00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:17.959
I hope your company doesn't reprimand you.

00:23:18.543 --> 00:23:19.544
Who would reprimand me?

00:23:20.712 --> 00:23:21.922
I'm the boss.

00:23:22.881 --> 00:23:25.091
Oh, you are?

00:23:25.842 --> 00:23:27.010
No wonder.

00:23:27.093 --> 00:23:28.678
You just swiped your card with ease

00:23:28.762 --> 00:23:31.431
at the shop yesterday
with the utmost charisma.

00:23:31.514 --> 00:23:32.724
That was nothing.

00:23:34.684 --> 00:23:35.810
That's amazing.

00:23:36.603 --> 00:23:39.231
We're around the same age,
and you already own a business.

00:23:39.314 --> 00:23:42.192
I think I'd be too scared
to start one myself.

00:23:42.275 --> 00:23:43.401
It isn't easy.

00:23:43.944 --> 00:23:44.778
But…

00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:52.160
Take a look. Here.

00:23:58.041 --> 00:23:59.459
It's very toned.

00:24:00.377 --> 00:24:02.712
You must work out a lot.

00:24:03.338 --> 00:24:06.424
That's right. I pushed through the pain
and worked out every day.

00:24:06.508 --> 00:24:09.636
You need to tear your muscles
to make them grow.

00:24:10.428 --> 00:24:11.888
I believe work is the same too.

00:24:11.972 --> 00:24:14.724
If you just push through and charge ahead,

00:24:14.808 --> 00:24:16.142
one day…

00:24:19.354 --> 00:24:20.522
you become strong.

00:24:21.106 --> 00:24:22.774
You're definitely

00:24:22.857 --> 00:24:24.192
nothing like me.

00:24:39.708 --> 00:24:40.917
Dolphins!

00:24:42.043 --> 00:24:43.378
They're so cute!

00:24:43.878 --> 00:24:44.963
Da-rim.

00:24:45.547 --> 00:24:46.798
You get a better view here.

00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:48.174
-Oh, you're right.
-Come over here.

00:24:51.386 --> 00:24:52.637
They're so cute.

00:24:56.308 --> 00:24:57.434
Take my hand.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.178
-Da-rim!
-I can't swim…

00:25:34.387 --> 00:25:35.305
Help…

00:25:35.388 --> 00:25:36.514
I can't swim…

00:25:46.066 --> 00:25:47.400
Are you okay?

00:27:31.963 --> 00:27:32.964
Wait.

00:27:34.674 --> 00:27:35.508
What?

00:27:36.843 --> 00:27:38.094
I just remembered

00:27:39.471 --> 00:27:41.014
that we haven't showered.

00:27:41.848 --> 00:27:42.682
Right.

00:27:43.892 --> 00:27:46.186
Can't we count that dip in the sea as one?

00:27:47.061 --> 00:27:48.104
No.

00:27:52.317 --> 00:27:53.902
Okay. Hold on.

00:27:53.985 --> 00:27:55.069
-Okay.
-Hold on.

00:28:00.825 --> 00:28:01.743
Stay right here.

00:28:01.826 --> 00:28:02.660
Okay.

00:28:10.084 --> 00:28:14.923
The wedding ceremony of Mr. Kang Min-guk
and Ms. Go Da-jeong will begin shortly.

00:28:15.006 --> 00:28:18.301
-All guests should make their way
-It's starting.

00:28:18.384 --> 00:28:20.845
-into the hall and take their seats.
-Okay, please go ahead first.

00:28:21.638 --> 00:28:23.890
-I repeat.
-My goodness.

00:28:23.973 --> 00:28:26.059
-Where in the world did Min-guk go?
-The wedding ceremony of Mr. Kang Min-guk

00:28:26.142 --> 00:28:29.354
-and Ms. Go Da-jeong will begin shortly.
-How strange.

00:28:29.437 --> 00:28:32.273
All guests should make their way
into the hall and take their seats.

00:28:32.357 --> 00:28:35.485
Please wish them well
through a warm round of applause.

00:28:46.079 --> 00:28:47.205
BLUEBIRD COIN

00:28:47.288 --> 00:28:51.334
Jeez. Where the hell
is that bastard Kang Min-guk hiding?

00:28:51.918 --> 00:28:53.002
Do you think he ran off?

00:28:53.086 --> 00:28:54.921
He wouldn't abandon his own wedding.

00:28:55.004 --> 00:28:56.256
He'll show up for the ceremony.

00:28:56.339 --> 00:28:58.007
But what if he really ran off?

00:28:58.091 --> 00:28:59.884
Should we at least collect
the congratulatory money?

00:29:00.635 --> 00:29:02.262
Are you being serious right now?

00:29:02.846 --> 00:29:03.972
If we catch him,

00:29:04.639 --> 00:29:06.933
his kidneys, heart,

00:29:07.016 --> 00:29:11.396
and even his eyes will be sold off
to collect his debt if need be.

00:29:11.479 --> 00:29:13.147
Right, we'll do whatever it takes.

00:29:15.525 --> 00:29:16.526
Min-guk!

00:29:17.151 --> 00:29:18.695
Da-jeong!

00:29:18.778 --> 00:29:20.572
-What's gotten into you?
-Damn it.

00:29:21.489 --> 00:29:22.699
Have you actually lost your mind?

00:29:22.782 --> 00:29:24.284
The ceremony is in five minutes.

00:29:24.367 --> 00:29:25.743
Yeah. Let's get out of here now.

00:29:25.827 --> 00:29:27.745
If we don't,
this wedding will become a funeral.

00:29:27.829 --> 00:29:28.997
-What?
-Hurry up.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.081
-What are you talking about?
-Hurry.

00:29:30.164 --> 00:29:31.040
Wait.

00:29:31.124 --> 00:29:32.458
Hurry up!

00:29:32.542 --> 00:29:33.501
Min-guk!

00:29:36.462 --> 00:29:37.505
What on earth?

00:29:38.548 --> 00:29:39.924
Where did she go?

00:29:44.429 --> 00:29:45.430
She's not here either.

00:29:46.764 --> 00:29:48.391
What's going on? Where did they all go?

00:29:48.975 --> 00:29:50.184
Excuse me.

00:29:50.268 --> 00:29:52.604
Who are you and what are you doing here?

00:29:54.063 --> 00:29:55.440
My goodness!

00:29:55.523 --> 00:29:58.818
Hey, lady,
where did you hide your daughter?

00:29:58.902 --> 00:30:01.863
Where the hell did you hide the crooks?

00:30:01.946 --> 00:30:05.158
Oh my goodness.
Who are you calling crooks?

00:30:05.241 --> 00:30:06.367
Let go of me.

00:30:06.451 --> 00:30:07.577
Let go!

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:08.828
Damn it.

00:30:09.579 --> 00:30:11.247
This bastard really fled.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:13.499
He took us for fools.

00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:14.876
Don't just stand there.

00:30:14.959 --> 00:30:16.252
Tear this place apart!

00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:17.170
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:30:19.756 --> 00:30:21.466
What in the world is going on?

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.051
Hold on.

00:30:23.968 --> 00:30:24.928
Careful.

00:30:26.262 --> 00:30:27.597
I'll get you some water.

00:30:29.349 --> 00:30:31.267
What on earth is happening?

00:30:33.561 --> 00:30:34.646
Mom.

00:30:34.729 --> 00:30:37.148
Min-guk said he'd pay me right back,

00:30:37.231 --> 00:30:39.692
so I gave him your savings,
the home equity loan,

00:30:39.776 --> 00:30:41.694
and I even got a loan from a loan shark.

00:30:42.362 --> 00:30:44.113
But he lost everything in crypto.

00:30:46.574 --> 00:30:47.742
Seon-u…

00:30:48.576 --> 00:30:49.410
Ma'am?

00:30:49.494 --> 00:30:50.787
How…

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:52.413
Ma'am?

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.458
Ma'am!

00:30:56.042 --> 00:30:58.252
Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:31:10.807 --> 00:31:12.016
SEON-U

00:31:15.061 --> 00:31:16.229
Hey, Seon-u. What's up?

00:31:16.312 --> 00:31:18.773
You need to come back right now.
Your mom has collapsed.

00:31:20.233 --> 00:31:21.067
What?

00:31:21.901 --> 00:31:25.363
Both Da-jeong and her fiancé disappeared,
and the wedding got canceled.

00:31:25.446 --> 00:31:27.407
Your mom collapsed from the shock.

00:31:27.907 --> 00:31:29.742
I took her to a hospital right away,

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:31.911
and they said she had a heart attack.

00:31:32.412 --> 00:31:33.663
She's in surgery now.

00:31:39.168 --> 00:31:40.003
Da-rim?

00:31:41.587 --> 00:31:42.588
Da-rim?

00:31:52.974 --> 00:31:54.100
Da-rim, are you in there?

00:31:56.019 --> 00:31:56.936
Da-rim?

00:31:59.772 --> 00:32:01.274
You're okay, right?

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:03.693
Da-rim?

00:33:47.922 --> 00:33:49.257
How is she?

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.385
They said we didn't miss the golden hour.

00:33:53.761 --> 00:33:54.971
We just need to wait for now.

00:33:55.054 --> 00:33:56.055
Seon-u.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.935
I can't let my mom go like this.

00:34:02.895 --> 00:34:05.940
How could I when I never even
properly treated her to anything?

00:34:06.941 --> 00:34:07.900
Right?

00:34:23.124 --> 00:34:24.083
It'll be okay.

00:34:26.627 --> 00:34:28.379
She's a strong person.

00:34:30.214 --> 00:34:31.340
She'll get through this.

00:34:33.843 --> 00:34:35.178
You're right.

00:34:35.261 --> 00:34:36.220
She'll be fine.

00:34:47.148 --> 00:34:49.150
Where in the world are you?

00:34:50.443 --> 00:34:51.527
I've landed in Seoul.

00:34:52.195 --> 00:34:53.279
I'm on my way.

00:34:53.362 --> 00:34:55.239
How'd it go with Hassan?

00:34:55.323 --> 00:34:56.908
I took care of it.

00:34:56.991 --> 00:34:59.994
It seems that he also did
a background check on Kim Jeong-gwon.

00:35:00.077 --> 00:35:01.996
He actually thanked me
for weeding him out.

00:35:02.538 --> 00:35:03.623
That's a relief.

00:35:03.706 --> 00:35:06.000
I'll compile a list of developers
who can replace him.

00:35:06.959 --> 00:35:08.002
All right.

00:35:08.836 --> 00:35:11.130
By the way,
what were you saying yesterday?

00:35:11.756 --> 00:35:13.758
Something about a kiss and souls.

00:35:13.841 --> 00:35:15.343
It sounded like a woman was involved.

00:35:15.426 --> 00:35:16.719
Forget it.

00:35:17.637 --> 00:35:18.512
Just let it go.

00:35:18.596 --> 00:35:20.264
Oh, come on. Why?

00:35:20.348 --> 00:35:22.266
You said it felt like an explosion.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.602
My rage exploded! Satisfied? Hang up.

00:35:28.856 --> 00:35:31.067
Love and intertwined souls?
What a load of crap.

00:35:58.302 --> 00:36:01.013
It's just as amazing as the
Grandfather Tree in my neighborhood.

00:36:01.806 --> 00:36:02.640
"Grandfather Tree"?

00:36:02.723 --> 00:36:05.476
I visit it whenever I feel stressed.

00:36:06.143 --> 00:36:08.688
There's a small store next to it,

00:36:08.771 --> 00:36:12.024
so I get myself a chocolate ice cream
and eat it underneath the tree.

00:36:12.108 --> 00:36:14.485
It somehow helps soothe my troubles.

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:22.785
What am I even doing right now?

00:36:25.913 --> 00:36:29.166
NAME: JEONG MYEONG-SUN

00:36:45.933 --> 00:36:47.435
Hey.

00:36:48.019 --> 00:36:49.854
I'll stay with her.

00:36:49.937 --> 00:36:51.605
You should go home, shower,
and take a nap.

00:36:51.689 --> 00:36:52.690
You haven't slept at all.

00:36:52.773 --> 00:36:55.234
No, I'm fine.

00:36:55.318 --> 00:36:56.485
Just do as I say.

00:36:57.069 --> 00:36:59.447
Her surgery went well,
so don't worry too much.

00:37:04.368 --> 00:37:05.411
Okay.

00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:14.670
AMOUNT DUE: 10,100,067 WON

00:37:17.089 --> 00:37:19.133
Is it normal for hospital bills

00:37:19.884 --> 00:37:21.635
to be this high?

00:37:21.719 --> 00:37:22.887
That's just for her surgery.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.805
You'll be charged more
for the duration of the hospitalization.

00:37:24.889 --> 00:37:27.975
We'll give you another bill for that
when she gets discharged.

00:37:28.059 --> 00:37:31.604
For now, you just need to settle
her surgery bill.

00:37:32.229 --> 00:37:35.149
You can pay by card,
cash, or wire transfer.

00:37:35.232 --> 00:37:36.359
How would you like to pay?

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.707
Da-rim.

00:38:01.217 --> 00:38:02.218
Da-rim.

00:38:03.844 --> 00:38:04.929
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

00:38:05.471 --> 00:38:08.140
You saw them bullying Da-jeong
and taught them a lesson?

00:38:08.224 --> 00:38:09.767
Yeah, I did.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:11.602
I even made them apologize to Da-jeong.

00:38:11.685 --> 00:38:14.647
My goodness, look at you
being such a reliable big sister.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.399
I'm going to become even stronger

00:38:16.482 --> 00:38:18.401
and protect you and Mom too.

00:38:18.484 --> 00:38:22.196
Sounds good. I feel so reassured,
thanks to my daughter.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:23.906
I can feel the power!

00:38:23.989 --> 00:38:25.574
-You're the best, Da-rim!
-The best!

00:38:27.827 --> 00:38:28.911
Da-rim is the best!

00:38:52.768 --> 00:38:54.019
Can I help you?

00:38:55.521 --> 00:38:56.939
Ms. Go Da-jeong lives here, right?

00:38:57.523 --> 00:38:59.358
Yes, she's my younger sister.

00:39:00.067 --> 00:39:01.569
I'm from First Class Bank.

00:39:01.652 --> 00:39:03.779
Ms. Go took out
a home equity loan on this property,

00:39:03.863 --> 00:39:05.281
and her payment is overdue.

00:39:05.364 --> 00:39:07.867
At this rate,
foreclosure will be inevitable.

00:39:08.909 --> 00:39:10.202
GO DA-JEONG

00:39:11.704 --> 00:39:13.914
The phone you are trying to reach
is turned off.

00:39:13.998 --> 00:39:15.958
You will be redirected to voicemail,

00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:18.210
and charges will apply after the beep.

00:39:23.716 --> 00:39:25.176
Have you lost your mind?

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.303
You must have.

00:39:28.387 --> 00:39:30.556
How could you put our house in jeopardy?

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.433
If we lose the house,

00:39:32.516 --> 00:39:34.477
are Mom and I supposed to be
out on the streets?

00:39:35.436 --> 00:39:36.270
Hey.

00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:41.192
Mom collapsed!

00:39:42.151 --> 00:39:44.778
What am I supposed to do?

00:39:45.321 --> 00:39:47.698
What in the world am I supposed to do?

00:40:18.354 --> 00:40:20.773
UTILITY BILL, INSURANCE, TRANSPORTATION

00:40:20.856 --> 00:40:22.858
PHONE BILL, HOUSEHOLD SUPPLIES FEES

00:40:22.942 --> 00:40:26.529
TOTAL INCOME, TOTAL EXPENSES, SAVINGS

00:40:26.612 --> 00:40:30.074
SPARE MONEY: 18,900 WON

00:41:00.104 --> 00:41:01.480
Come to think of it,

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:04.650
I didn't even have a chance
to say goodbye.

00:41:07.027 --> 00:41:08.946
He must think I'm a weirdo.

00:41:14.034 --> 00:41:15.369
COUNTER 3, LOANS

00:41:16.912 --> 00:41:19.873
With your unemployment status
and low credit score,

00:41:19.957 --> 00:41:22.001
you'd be eligible
for up to two million won.

00:41:22.084 --> 00:41:23.836
Would you like to proceed?

00:41:32.636 --> 00:41:33.554
APARTMENT-BACKED LOAN

00:41:33.637 --> 00:41:35.222
SAME-DAY LOANS FOR OFFICE WORKERS

00:41:43.105 --> 00:41:43.981
Welcome.

00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:50.195
Where are the nail clippers?

00:41:50.279 --> 00:41:51.905
I'll get it for you.

00:42:09.673 --> 00:42:10.674
Sorry!

00:42:10.758 --> 00:42:11.634
Oh no!

00:42:17.473 --> 00:42:18.807
It's okay.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.699
Can we get more iced water?

00:42:35.783 --> 00:42:37.701
Sure. Coming!

00:42:40.871 --> 00:42:42.623
HOSPITALIZATION FEE: 5,475,320 WON

00:42:59.014 --> 00:43:00.724
Excuse me. Oh no.

00:43:11.568 --> 00:43:14.113
Da-jeong, I hope this reaches you.

00:43:15.072 --> 00:43:16.573
You must've been so scared.

00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:18.659
I hope you're feeling better now.

00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:21.662
But you know,

00:43:22.705 --> 00:43:24.707
I think it was a big shock to Mom too.

00:43:25.541 --> 00:43:27.209
She collapsed.

00:43:28.001 --> 00:43:29.336
She suffered a heart attack.

00:43:33.382 --> 00:43:35.592
They said her surgery went well,

00:43:36.135 --> 00:43:37.553
so she should wake up soon.

00:43:39.304 --> 00:43:41.557
For now, don't worry about us.

00:43:42.224 --> 00:43:43.392
Just make sure you're safe.

00:43:44.351 --> 00:43:46.645
I'll find the money somehow,

00:43:46.729 --> 00:43:48.021
so don't worry.

00:43:48.689 --> 00:43:51.608
Wherever you are, make sure you eat well.

00:43:52.234 --> 00:43:55.320
You need to take care of yourself
and stay healthy, okay?

00:43:56.405 --> 00:43:57.448
That again?

00:43:57.948 --> 00:43:59.992
How many times
are you going to listen to--

00:44:00.701 --> 00:44:01.535
How can you eat right now?

00:44:02.453 --> 00:44:06.498
How the hell can you eat
at a time like this?

00:44:14.631 --> 00:44:18.051
It appears the portfolio submissions
we receive remain limited.

00:44:18.844 --> 00:44:22.264
If you're okay with photography,
do you want to take a look?

00:44:22.806 --> 00:44:24.391
They may not be famous,

00:44:24.475 --> 00:44:27.311
but I have a collection
of personal favorites.

00:44:30.481 --> 00:44:32.441
DEPUTY DIRECTOR YU HA-YEONG

00:44:43.368 --> 00:44:45.245
His work has a nice vibe, doesn't it?

00:44:46.121 --> 00:44:46.955
It does.

00:44:47.664 --> 00:44:48.791
Is it because the model's pretty?

00:44:49.708 --> 00:44:50.918
It's because she's loved.

00:44:52.002 --> 00:44:55.672
Look. Only people who are loved
can have that look in their eyes.

00:44:57.508 --> 00:44:58.800
Who's the photographer?

00:44:59.384 --> 00:45:00.802
His name is Kim Seon-u.

00:45:00.886 --> 00:45:03.096
It was an award-winning piece
a long time ago.

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.556
He hasn't been active since then.

00:45:05.057 --> 00:45:06.558
Did he quit photography?

00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:10.771
For now, get me his contact info
and find out what he's been up to.

00:45:10.854 --> 00:45:11.688
Yes, ma'am.

00:45:37.965 --> 00:45:40.050
I visit it whenever I feel stressed.

00:45:40.926 --> 00:45:42.970
There's a small store next to it,

00:45:43.554 --> 00:45:47.266
so I get myself a chocolate ice cream
and eat it underneath the tree.

00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:49.935
It somehow helps soothe my troubles.

00:45:54.314 --> 00:45:55.482
Found it.

00:46:21.508 --> 00:46:25.679
HACKBERRY TREE, ZELKOVA TREE, GINKGO TREE

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.234
Yeah.

00:46:42.404 --> 00:46:43.238
Then what happened?

00:46:57.544 --> 00:46:59.212
Another day of aimless searching?

00:47:01.131 --> 00:47:03.800
Jeez, you're one persistent man.

00:47:03.884 --> 00:47:05.385
It's been days already.

00:47:07.804 --> 00:47:09.514
What's so special about her anyway?

00:47:14.353 --> 00:47:16.229
She blew my mind.

00:47:17.064 --> 00:47:19.232
You said it yourself. Chemical reaction.

00:47:20.942 --> 00:47:22.444
You finally found the one!

00:47:22.527 --> 00:47:24.363
Then you have to find her, no matter what!

00:47:24.946 --> 00:47:25.781
I'll help you.

00:47:29.326 --> 00:47:32.913
Almond-shaped, monolid eyes.

00:47:33.455 --> 00:47:35.624
And a high nose.

00:47:35.707 --> 00:47:37.209
What else did you say?

00:47:37.793 --> 00:47:38.669
She's cute.

00:47:40.087 --> 00:47:41.672
She's really cute when she smiles.

00:47:43.715 --> 00:47:45.342
Almond-shaped eyes and a cute smile.

00:47:45.425 --> 00:47:46.843
That's a bit tricky.

00:47:47.469 --> 00:47:49.054
Anyway…

00:47:49.137 --> 00:47:50.013
The fried chicken's here.

00:47:51.682 --> 00:47:52.766
Hello.

00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:53.934
You're early.

00:47:54.726 --> 00:47:55.811
Here.

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.063
-Gyeong-min.
-Yes?

00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:06.071
-Do you want beer?
-Sounds good!

00:48:06.154 --> 00:48:07.197
Okay!

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.615
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

00:48:08.699 --> 00:48:10.784
-Have a good night.
-You too.

00:48:23.213 --> 00:48:25.090
Ma'am, we're here to escort you.

00:48:46.653 --> 00:48:50.866
JUMYEONG PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

00:48:51.742 --> 00:48:52.993
What does she look like?

00:48:53.076 --> 00:48:54.035
Well…

00:48:55.454 --> 00:48:56.788
She has fair skin.

00:48:56.872 --> 00:48:57.748
Okay.

00:48:57.831 --> 00:49:00.083
And she has a baby face.

00:49:04.379 --> 00:49:06.757
-Her eyes are big and bright like this.
-Okay.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.217
But when she smiles,
they turn into cute crescent moons.

00:49:11.344 --> 00:49:12.971
Oh, I know her.

00:49:13.722 --> 00:49:15.348
You do? Really?

00:49:15.432 --> 00:49:16.975
That's me.

00:49:17.058 --> 00:49:19.311
This is exactly what I looked like
when I was young.

00:49:19.394 --> 00:49:21.354
All the men used to line up
around the block.

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:25.400
Don't be ridiculous.

00:49:26.276 --> 00:49:28.653
So, what's her name?

00:49:31.156 --> 00:49:33.116
JUMYEONG PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL HEAD NURSE

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.701
Excuse me for a moment.

00:49:37.078 --> 00:49:38.121
Hello?

00:49:39.998 --> 00:49:41.124
Right now?

00:49:42.042 --> 00:49:43.084
Okay.

00:49:44.252 --> 00:49:46.296
Congratulations on being
the leading baby product brand

00:49:46.379 --> 00:49:47.506
for 20 consecutive years.

00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:49.966
What's the secret
behind your lasting popularity?

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:51.927
There's no secret.

00:49:53.094 --> 00:49:53.929
I always…

00:49:55.597 --> 00:50:00.101
make our products with the mindset
that my wife and kids will be using them.

00:50:00.185 --> 00:50:04.189
I'm just grateful our consumers
have come to recognize our sincerity.

00:50:04.272 --> 00:50:06.608
We all expected it, but it appears
your family was the motivation.

00:50:06.691 --> 00:50:08.151
It's our first time meeting,
Director Gong,

00:50:08.235 --> 00:50:09.903
and I must say, you're beautiful.

00:50:09.986 --> 00:50:12.364
You look just like your mother.

00:50:12.948 --> 00:50:13.782
Ma'am.

00:50:13.865 --> 00:50:16.368
What sort of daughter
is Director Gong at home?

00:50:34.469 --> 00:50:35.554
Mom.

00:50:41.226 --> 00:50:44.646
I'm sorry to say,
but I think we'll wrap it up here.

00:50:44.729 --> 00:50:47.065
My wife's not feeling well.

00:50:47.566 --> 00:50:49.109
-Sure.
-Thank you.

00:50:54.072 --> 00:50:55.031
Mom.

00:50:56.366 --> 00:50:57.325
Are you okay?

00:51:04.791 --> 00:51:05.792
Thank you.

00:51:15.468 --> 00:51:17.345
Rest for a bit before you come down.

00:51:18.054 --> 00:51:19.639
I'll take you back to the hospital.

00:51:30.317 --> 00:51:31.735
Go take care of it.

00:51:31.818 --> 00:51:34.362
-Make sure that reporter keeps quiet.
-Yes, sir.

00:51:37.073 --> 00:51:38.575
Goodness gracious.

00:51:40.702 --> 00:51:41.870
Have you lost your mind?

00:51:42.704 --> 00:51:44.831
She's suffering as it is
from the side effects of her medication.

00:51:44.915 --> 00:51:47.208
Did you have to bring her here
to play house?

00:51:47.292 --> 00:51:49.169
All she had to do was sit there quietly.

00:51:49.252 --> 00:51:50.754
It's the least a deadbeat wife can do!

00:51:50.837 --> 00:51:52.047
It's because of you.

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:53.256
What?

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:55.050
Why do you think
she can't do anything anymore?

00:51:55.675 --> 00:51:57.177
You made her like that!

00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:58.386
Why you little…

00:52:05.977 --> 00:52:07.145
Let her go now.

00:52:08.855 --> 00:52:10.065
Just get a divorce already.

00:52:10.148 --> 00:52:11.149
Divorce?

00:52:11.816 --> 00:52:13.777
Did you forget what our company sells?

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.779
Baby products
packaged with love and happiness.

00:52:16.613 --> 00:52:19.074
And you refuse to let her go
to sell that public image.

00:52:19.908 --> 00:52:22.661
Is that more important
than a person's life?

00:52:22.744 --> 00:52:23.912
What if she tries to…

00:52:33.964 --> 00:52:35.090
If you divorce her,

00:52:36.216 --> 00:52:37.467
I'll do whatever you want.

00:52:38.468 --> 00:52:39.844
All right, fine.

00:52:40.762 --> 00:52:41.680
In that case,

00:52:42.806 --> 00:52:45.225
stop what you're doing now
and come work for the company.

00:52:45.308 --> 00:52:46.184
And

00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:48.311
marry Chairman Yu's daughter.

00:52:49.229 --> 00:52:50.188
If I do that,

00:52:51.272 --> 00:52:52.565
will you let Mother go?

00:52:52.649 --> 00:52:54.985
Did I ever fail to keep my word
when it came to the company?

00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:57.529
Fine.

00:52:58.488 --> 00:52:59.990
I'll write up the notarized document
regarding the agreement

00:53:00.949 --> 00:53:02.409
and send it to you.

00:53:12.085 --> 00:53:13.044
Notarized document?

00:53:15.922 --> 00:53:17.590
He's my son, all right. How thorough.

00:53:18.258 --> 00:53:19.092
Did you hear that?

00:53:19.175 --> 00:53:21.386
Make a position for Ji-hyeok
in the company.

00:53:21.469 --> 00:53:22.429
Okay.

00:53:23.763 --> 00:53:26.516
But are you sure about this?

00:53:27.434 --> 00:53:28.935
You're risking divorce.

00:53:29.019 --> 00:53:31.479
If it's a profitable deal,
there's no reason not to.

00:53:41.364 --> 00:53:42.198
Mom.

00:53:43.324 --> 00:53:44.951
I should've prevented it in advance.

00:53:46.369 --> 00:53:47.203
I'm sorry.

00:53:47.287 --> 00:53:49.330
What do you have to be sorry about?

00:53:56.046 --> 00:53:56.880
Mom?

00:54:00.425 --> 00:54:01.634
Mom.

00:54:03.136 --> 00:54:04.345
Mom!

00:54:10.477 --> 00:54:11.311
Mom.

00:54:12.604 --> 00:54:13.813
Just hang in there.

00:54:15.106 --> 00:54:16.649
I promise you'll be free soon.

00:54:20.862 --> 00:54:22.739
Ma'am, you can't do this here.

00:54:22.822 --> 00:54:25.533
Then tell me why I was rejected.

00:54:26.117 --> 00:54:28.036
You have no experience at all.

00:54:28.119 --> 00:54:29.287
What do you mean?

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:31.289
What's wrong with you? Jeez.

00:54:31.372 --> 00:54:33.500
I wrote everything down in great detail.

00:54:34.334 --> 00:54:36.044
-See?
-Let me take a look.

00:54:37.087 --> 00:54:38.421
Hello, ma'am.

00:54:42.342 --> 00:54:45.804
You left your first company
after three months.

00:54:45.887 --> 00:54:49.015
I got pregnant as soon as I got married,
and I had terrible morning sickness.

00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:50.642
I see.

00:54:52.268 --> 00:54:53.353
You left your second company

00:54:53.978 --> 00:54:55.146
after two months.

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.941
My second child had trouble
adjusting to daycare.

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:01.194
And you left your third company
after a month.

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:05.198
My youngest came down with pneumonia,
and I had to be there to--

00:55:05.281 --> 00:55:06.157
Exactly.

00:55:06.241 --> 00:55:09.577
You should go home
and look after your children.

00:55:09.661 --> 00:55:11.830
We don't hire people
who quit at the drop of a hat.

00:55:11.913 --> 00:55:14.749
It'll only make the company a hot mess.
A hot, sweaty mess!

00:55:15.708 --> 00:55:17.043
He's my son, all right.

00:55:17.127 --> 00:55:19.629
Make a position for Ji-hyeok
in the company.

00:55:20.213 --> 00:55:22.006
What did you just say?

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:23.675
How is motherhood not counted

00:55:23.758 --> 00:55:25.718
as the most significant
professional experience

00:55:25.802 --> 00:55:28.138
by a baby product company?

00:55:28.221 --> 00:55:30.682
That's true. You're right about that.

00:55:30.765 --> 00:55:31.850
Pardon?

00:55:32.517 --> 00:55:33.768
No, you can't, Ms. Gong.

00:55:33.852 --> 00:55:36.104
She's not going to get any work done.

00:55:36.187 --> 00:55:37.897
She'll whine and complain all day

00:55:37.981 --> 00:55:40.567
before she just quits whenever she wants.

00:55:41.359 --> 00:55:42.694
That sounds great.

00:55:42.777 --> 00:55:46.781
Let's hire a few more ladies
exactly like her

00:55:46.865 --> 00:55:47.824
to make a team.

00:55:47.907 --> 00:55:48.950
A team?

00:55:49.033 --> 00:55:51.119
Applicants with the most
unimpressive resumes,

00:55:51.202 --> 00:55:52.579
impossible personalities,

00:55:52.662 --> 00:55:54.664
and erratic behavior.

00:55:54.747 --> 00:55:57.917
Any mom with a kid under 6 years old
is welcome.

00:55:58.001 --> 00:56:00.461
Why would we hire people like that?

00:56:01.963 --> 00:56:04.048
My younger brother is joining the company.

00:56:04.132 --> 00:56:05.175
As his older sister,

00:56:05.258 --> 00:56:08.052
shouldn't I create
a suitable position for him?

00:56:19.063 --> 00:56:19.898
Mom.

00:56:21.566 --> 00:56:22.400
Mom…

00:56:24.444 --> 00:56:25.778
You're going to be okay.

00:56:26.571 --> 00:56:28.990
The surgery went really well.

00:56:30.241 --> 00:56:32.702
And I'm right here.

00:56:35.038 --> 00:56:36.831
Why are you crying?

00:56:36.915 --> 00:56:38.541
You're already unwell enough as it is.

00:56:45.089 --> 00:56:46.925
Sorry…

00:56:48.092 --> 00:56:50.136
Why would you be sorry?

00:56:51.304 --> 00:56:52.180
Mom.

00:56:53.723 --> 00:56:55.433
Don't worry about a thing now.

00:56:56.601 --> 00:56:58.478
I'm going to take care of everything.

00:57:00.063 --> 00:57:01.856
Just trust me.

00:57:02.482 --> 00:57:03.441
Okay?

00:57:04.525 --> 00:57:05.401
Okay?

00:57:08.071 --> 00:57:09.572
Thank goodness.

00:57:12.492 --> 00:57:14.994
Why do you keep crying?

00:57:20.416 --> 00:57:21.584
What's wrong?

00:57:21.668 --> 00:57:23.086
Stop crying.

00:57:24.754 --> 00:57:25.964
Thank you, Seon-u.

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:29.133
My mom's alive, thanks to you.

00:57:30.426 --> 00:57:31.427
Don't be silly.

00:57:36.724 --> 00:57:38.810
-Da-rim.
-Yeah?

00:57:40.478 --> 00:57:42.021
I thought about it,

00:57:43.064 --> 00:57:44.232
and if I close down the studio,

00:57:44.315 --> 00:57:46.985
the deposit should be enough
to cover her medical bills.

00:57:47.068 --> 00:57:48.570
-So--
-Hey.

00:57:48.653 --> 00:57:50.738
What are you talking about?

00:57:51.322 --> 00:57:52.782
Why would you touch that money?

00:57:53.324 --> 00:57:55.410
She was the one who looked after Jun

00:57:55.493 --> 00:57:57.495
when I was completely out of it
after my divorce.

00:58:00.039 --> 00:58:02.208
She's more or less a mother to me.

00:58:02.292 --> 00:58:03.710
That's why you can't.

00:58:04.502 --> 00:58:05.837
Mom wouldn't want you to either.

00:58:06.421 --> 00:58:08.631
You still have to raise Jun as well.

00:58:08.715 --> 00:58:10.883
No way. Don't be ridiculous.

00:58:11.467 --> 00:58:12.594
Then what?

00:58:13.469 --> 00:58:14.554
Forget part-time.

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.141
I'll find a job
that pays me a proper salary.

00:58:19.559 --> 00:58:22.312
Once I start working,
I'll be able to get a loan as well.

00:58:24.522 --> 00:58:26.190
Look how tough you've become, Go Da-rim.

00:58:32.405 --> 00:58:34.073
I heard your muscles

00:58:35.408 --> 00:58:38.328
need to be torn up
for them to grow stronger.

00:58:39.996 --> 00:58:41.372
No matter how hard it is,

00:58:42.165 --> 00:58:43.750
I need to grow new, stronger muscles.

00:58:44.917 --> 00:58:46.628
I'm the breadwinner now.

00:58:47.253 --> 00:58:49.088
Who told you that?

00:58:51.591 --> 00:58:53.843
Just someone I know.

00:59:00.308 --> 00:59:03.102
If I qualify by age,
I fall short on experience.

00:59:04.312 --> 00:59:07.190
And there's no company
that would accept me as an entry-level.

00:59:08.566 --> 00:59:09.817
This isn't looking good.

00:59:13.071 --> 00:59:16.240
"No age, experience,
or education requirements"?

00:59:18.785 --> 00:59:20.244
"Qualification requirements."

00:59:20.328 --> 00:59:23.039
"A mother raising a child
under the age of 6."

00:59:23.915 --> 00:59:24.832
That's it?

00:59:26.834 --> 00:59:27.794
It is.

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:30.880
All I need is a kid?

00:59:33.466 --> 00:59:34.842
So what?

00:59:35.635 --> 00:59:37.845
It's not like I can suddenly have a kid.

00:59:40.014 --> 00:59:42.684
Kim Jun, I told you to stop running.

00:59:42.767 --> 00:59:45.311
You're not sleeping either.
I'm going to play some more.

00:59:45.395 --> 00:59:46.896
Come here! Right now!

00:59:50.024 --> 00:59:51.317
You'll be in big trouble if I catch you!

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:55.863
I mean,

00:59:55.947 --> 00:59:57.740
there is a kid in our house.

00:59:57.824 --> 00:59:59.659
-Come here.
-No!

01:00:00.576 --> 01:00:03.913
Look at me and my nonsense.

01:00:03.996 --> 01:00:05.248
But then again,

01:00:05.915 --> 01:00:08.584
I'm pretty close to Jun.

01:00:08.668 --> 01:00:11.337
-Here you are!
-I could be a mother figure to him.

01:00:12.839 --> 01:00:13.673
Got you!

01:00:15.591 --> 01:00:16.551
DOWNLOAD APPLICATION

01:00:17.135 --> 01:00:18.678
No, I can't.

01:00:19.345 --> 01:00:21.055
I would be outright lying.

01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:22.974
Only scammers would do that.

01:00:23.933 --> 01:00:25.226
Jeez.

01:00:42.994 --> 01:00:44.036
Da-rim.

01:01:09.687 --> 01:01:10.730
Dad.

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:13.107
I know this is wrong.

01:01:14.317 --> 01:01:16.778
But I have Mom's medical bills to pay,

01:01:16.861 --> 01:01:18.321
and if I can't make the interest payments,

01:01:18.404 --> 01:01:20.490
we'll be out on the street,
so what can I do?

01:01:21.365 --> 01:01:24.285
I honestly don't think
I have any other choice left.

01:01:24.368 --> 01:01:25.828
So please…

01:01:27.246 --> 01:01:31.459
Please just let it slide this one time,
so I can protect our family.

01:01:31.542 --> 01:01:32.418
Okay?

01:01:33.795 --> 01:01:35.254
Forgive me.

01:01:39.342 --> 01:01:40.885
Just look away.

01:01:46.516 --> 01:01:47.892
PERSONAL INFORMATION

01:01:47.975 --> 01:01:52.480
SPOUSE: KIM SEON-U
CHILD: KIM JUN

01:01:52.563 --> 01:01:53.523
SUBMIT

01:01:56.859 --> 01:02:00.988
At 30, the only experience she has
is being born and giving birth.

01:02:02.949 --> 01:02:03.825
She's perfect.

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:08.329
Hey, Ji-hyeok.

01:02:10.706 --> 01:02:11.916
You wanted to see me?

01:02:13.709 --> 01:02:15.211
Welcome to the company.

01:02:15.294 --> 01:02:16.879
It feels so reassuring to have you here.

01:02:16.963 --> 01:02:18.047
You shouldn't.

01:02:18.548 --> 01:02:21.551
I have neither interest
nor knowledge of baby products.

01:02:21.634 --> 01:02:24.637
Is there anything you want to do?
Any specific team you want to join?

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.932
No, just put me on the most lax team
with the least amount of responsibilities.

01:02:28.015 --> 01:02:29.559
I can't do that.

01:02:29.642 --> 01:02:30.810
I can't waste such talent.

01:02:32.019 --> 01:02:35.857
Actually, there's this task force team
we've been working on for a while now.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.483
-A TF team?
-Yeah.

01:02:37.567 --> 01:02:39.902
We're planning to put together
a team of moms.

01:02:39.986 --> 01:02:42.196
They'll be involved in everything,
including marketing, customer service,

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.365
and even product development,
with input based on

01:02:44.448 --> 01:02:45.408
their real-life experiences.

01:02:45.992 --> 01:02:46.909
An ombudsman team, if you will.

01:02:49.912 --> 01:02:50.913
Why should I lead that team?

01:02:50.997 --> 01:02:52.081
Well,

01:02:52.748 --> 01:02:53.875
the government is also promoting

01:02:53.958 --> 01:02:56.043
employment support programs
for women with career breaks.

01:02:56.878 --> 01:02:59.130
It'll receive attention
both internally and externally.

01:02:59.922 --> 01:03:01.716
Do you want to take a look at the resumes?

01:03:03.467 --> 01:03:04.802
It's the list of final candidates.

01:03:14.562 --> 01:03:16.606
RESUME

01:03:33.831 --> 01:03:35.207
Forget it.

01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:37.418
You can hire whoever you want.

01:03:37.501 --> 01:03:38.336
I'm off.

01:03:38.419 --> 01:03:41.380
What are you talking about?
You'll be leading this team.

01:03:41.964 --> 01:03:43.716
Make sure to be at the interview tomorrow.

01:03:44.383 --> 01:03:46.928
2025 NATURAL BEBE
NEW MOTHER TF TEAM RECRUITMENT INTERVIEW

01:03:49.972 --> 01:03:52.224
Hello, I'm here to interview
for the Mother TF Team.

01:03:52.308 --> 01:03:54.769
I'm a mother of two sons and one daughter.

01:03:54.852 --> 01:03:58.147
The first part-time job I had
when I turned 20 years old

01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:00.733
was at a children's playroom
called Playground.

01:04:00.816 --> 01:04:03.569
I believe there's nothing more important
than experience.

01:04:03.653 --> 01:04:06.864
With my experience
using countless baby products,

01:04:06.948 --> 01:04:10.159
I hope to create a product
that will also benefit Natural BeBe.

01:04:10.242 --> 01:04:13.120
Natural products for all mothers,
Natural BeBe.

01:04:13.204 --> 01:04:14.413
I look forward to working with you.

01:04:14.497 --> 01:04:15.748
-Thank you.
-I look forward to working with you.

01:04:15.831 --> 01:04:16.958
I look forward to working with you.

01:04:17.041 --> 01:04:19.335
RESULT: PASS

MOTHER TF TEAM RECRUITMENT INTERVIEW

01:04:30.388 --> 01:04:31.847
Applicant 51, Ms. Go Da-rim.

01:04:32.848 --> 01:04:34.308
We're ready for you.

01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:37.395
RESUME

01:05:07.049 --> 01:05:10.219
Hello. My name is Go Da-rim.

01:05:43.461 --> 01:05:48.382
DYNAMITE KISS

01:06:08.486 --> 01:06:10.613
Why is that man here?

01:06:10.696 --> 01:06:13.449
Why did you tell me
you didn't have a boyfriend?

01:06:13.532 --> 01:06:14.700
I don't have a boyfriend.

01:06:14.784 --> 01:06:16.660
I have a husband.

01:06:16.744 --> 01:06:19.121
I'm done with your nonsense. Get lost.

01:06:19.205 --> 01:06:20.790
I refuse to get lost!

01:06:20.873 --> 01:06:22.458
-You refuse?
-I won't get lost.

01:06:22.541 --> 01:06:23.584
Have you lost your mind?

01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:25.419
Just pretend to be my husband
for six months.

01:06:25.503 --> 01:06:28.923
Eat, hang out, relax, kill time,
or whatever for the next six months.

01:06:29.006 --> 01:06:32.218
However, just make sure not to bother me.

01:06:32.301 --> 01:06:33.886
You think I'll quit over this?

01:06:33.969 --> 01:06:36.806
Let's see who wins.

01:06:36.889 --> 01:06:38.599
There's nothing more to discuss.
Hand in your resignation.

01:06:38.682 --> 01:06:40.101
You can leave.

01:06:40.184 --> 01:06:41.894
I'm not some brat
born into cushy privilege

01:06:41.977 --> 01:06:43.687
who never worries about making ends meet.

01:06:44.188 --> 01:06:45.731
Is that so? Then I'll leave.

01:06:45.815 --> 01:06:50.027
