[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.970
[Episode 17]

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.870
Thank you both for seeing me off.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.820
Du.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.930
Ninghu is prosperous.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.120
After you get there,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.850
you won't suffer any hardship.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.340
I just remembered—

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.560
you once served
as the magistrate of Ninghu.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.350
Indeed I did.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.560
But I've also heard

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.670
that place is crawling with alligators.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.950
If you don't provoke them,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.080
they won't bite you.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.440
Still not as good as Guanzhong.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.450
I heard they have good wine though.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.740
What's it called again?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.990
Nantian Wine.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.560
Right.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.280
Exactly.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.410
That's the name.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.900
Once I'm in Ninghu,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.950
I'll finally get to enjoy

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.530
some Nantian Wine.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.390
Du, are you happy

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.450
or not happy?

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.400
Of course I'm not happy.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.240
I got demoted.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.630
How could I possibly be happy?

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.290
But your face says otherwise.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.680
You look absolutely thrilled.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.860
Like you got exactly what you wanted.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.930
Nonsense.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.910
Su Wuming,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.750
you're such a fraud!

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.680
Y-You fooled the Emperor.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.150
You fraud.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.600
But since you came to see me off,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.510
I won't hold it against you.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.240
Lu Lingfeng,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.480
you're a true gentleman.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.960
Upright and skilled
in both civil and military arts.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.160
You're a rare talent.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.000
By rights,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.520
after killing that monster Ao Tian

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.080
and keeping the capital safe,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.520
you should be promoted

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.840
and take my place
as Yongzhou's Chief Administrator.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.170
It's a pity I don't make that call.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.970
I wish you good luck.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.030
Actually,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.420
I once served under Master Di too.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.680
Though I'm not as good
at catching criminals as Lu Lingfeng,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.360
nor as sharp as Su Wuming with cases,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.420
once I'm in Ninghu,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.960
I'll still find a way

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.220
to put my skills to use.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.520
I'm off.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.150
Gotta say,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.000
the real winner here is His Majesty.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.079
He sent me
to bury the four Imperial Guards

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.590
and wouldn't let Du Ming come along.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.450
Do you know why?

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.400
To prevent others from seeing the bodies

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.820
and exposing your lie.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.190
Exactly.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.630
Seizing the opportunity

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.990
during chaos

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.600
and turning the Tang Empire's fate around,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.710
His Majesty is no ordinary ruler.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.310
He's truly admirable.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.560
Not finding the real Bai Ze

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.680
was expected.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.920
Nothing to feel down about.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.870
It's just that...

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.040
Du Ming had sided with me,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.600
but now he's kicked out of the capital.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.310
The Princess

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.000
has recommended three people in a row.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.800
I turned them all down,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.960
but if she brings up another name,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.350
I'm afraid

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.670
I won't even have a good excuse
to reject it.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.600
What do you think of Lu Lingfeng?

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.430
Your Majesty,

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.600
you've worked so hard

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.930
to get where you are now.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.430
Yongzhou's Chief Administrator

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.160
is such an important position.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.570
You must not act rashly

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.580
or easily give it to someone else.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.950
But I

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.370
currently have no one suitable to use.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.920
Xiong Qiannian's been back
in Chang'an for days.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.780
I've been watching him in secret.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.480
He hasn't had any contact

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.080
with the Princess's people.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.730
He's been waiting
for Your Majesty's favor.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.920
Xiong Qiannian?

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.380
He used to serve in the court.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.830
It was only later

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.030
that he became the Governor of Nanzhou.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.490
He is indeed a suitable candidate.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.000
How could I have forgotten him?

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.480
Lu.

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.950
Su.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.970
Governor Xiong, how have you been?

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.430
That title from my Nanzhou post…

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.950
I find it

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.600
quite endearing.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.130
You've got the title wrong.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.750
I am Su Wuming, a humble official.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.120
Greetings, Chief Administrator Xiong.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:18.550
Official?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.800
[Xiong Qiannian,
Governor of Nanzhou Prefecture]

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.360
I just checked the roster.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.110
[Xiong Qiannian,
Yongzhou's Chief Administrator]

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.830
There's no record

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.070
of any position you hold.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.470
Su Wuming

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.150
is currently
the Criminal Scholar of Yongzhou.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.150
He works under me.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.240
Criminal Investigation Scholar?

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.560
Is that an official position
recognized by the Ministry of Personnel?

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.220
Du Ming was truly absurd.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.200
Someone as gifted as Su

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.270
shouldn't have been given

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.330
some vague and unofficial-sounding

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.310
"scholar" title.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.830
Then tell me, Chief Administrator Xiong,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.310
what position

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.510
should someone like me hold?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.240
We must follow the court's regulations.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:10.650
However,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.310
I value friendship highly.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.090
Aren't you also

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.920
the Chief of Secret Agents?

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.720
You can continue with that role.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.120
I have no objections.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.360
Furthermore,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.560
once there's an opportunity,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.820
I will certainly recommend you.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.920
His Majesty is eager
to find talented people.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.000
I believe that in the near future,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.680
-you'll surely…
-I'll surely become like you,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.770
wearing the robes of high rank.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.600
I wouldn't dare to hope for that.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.070
[Su Wuming, Criminal Scholar of Yongzhou]

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.570
Since my name doesn't appear

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.159
[Su Wuming,
Chief of Secret Agents of Yongzhou]

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:46.159
on the Yongzhou officials' roster,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.800
I'll take my leave now.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.720
I suppose

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.950
the newly appointed Chief Administrator

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.800
and the Judicial Official

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.190
must have much official business
to discuss.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.250
I'll take my leave.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.010
I'll take my leave.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.270
Su.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.480
Su.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.410
Look at him.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.370
Su Wuming is one of the Princess's men.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.170
She made him the so-called

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.490
Criminal Investigation Scholar.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.600
Thank you for the heads-up.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.630
I

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.420
know what to do now.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.510
Lord Yan.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.600
Lord Yan?

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.990
It really is him.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.280
What took you so long?

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.330
I've been waiting for an hour.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.960
Don't be upset, my lord.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.790
The flight over Qinling
and Jianghuai was smooth.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.420
But over Dongting Lake,

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.080
a heavy fog suddenly arose.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.050
I got lost

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.200
and ended up flying toward Huating.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.630
I had to turn around again.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.290
That's why I was delayed.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:49.960
Did you miss me?

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.790
Damn you, Yan Junxian.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.710
I knew it was you!

Let's talk about Meng Buyi first.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.440
We've rekindled our relationship.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.820
Hasn't he noticed?

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.080
How could he notice?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.240
He works the night shift
at the county office every day.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.960
When the sun rises here,

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.030
it's still pitch dark over where he is.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.390
Yan Junxian!

You're on night duty again tonight?

Would you like me

to get you some tasty food?

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.030

Your wife is truly considerate.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.350
Indeed she is.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.700
I heard

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.360
that the book you wrote,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.510
"Strange Tales of the Divine Capital,"

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.810
is in bookstores

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.290
and selling quite well.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.120
You must have made quite a fortune.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.010
How enviable.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.240
I didn't make any money.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.990
Those are all rumors.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.170
Ignore them.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.370
Rest assured, Secretary.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.360
You've been using your night duty time
at the county office

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.360
to secretly write your books.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.200
But I

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.020
won't breathe a word about it.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.600
Don't put it like that.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.940
I've got my work done.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.310
That's right.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.670
Even if you also write
during the day sometimes,

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.200
so what?

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.180
As long as the real work gets done,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.600

I have a story about a snake demon.

Would you like to hear it?

If you include it

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.890
in your strange tales,

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.840

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.260

Still wounded,
yet he's already practicing swordplay.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.280
I called him three times,
and he ignored me.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.410
That one's the same.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.800
He got fired,
yet he still sits there writing.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.360
I called him to eat,
and he wouldn't come.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.980
As if that thing he's creating with ink

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.180
can fill his stomach.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.120
And he looks so pleased with himself.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.120
How infuriating.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.460
Of course it'll be cut.

You're reaping what you sowed.

Actually, I

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.930
don't care about these things at all.

At worst, I'll quit being

The strange tales I write,

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.510
bookstores will be fighting over them,

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.080
and they'll sell for a high price!

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.810
Who else has stories like mine?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.440
And the key is—I write them well!

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.240
Now that you've all eaten your fill,
come over here.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.150
I'll read you a passage.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.150
-Great!
-Come on.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.340

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.540

Stop it!

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
You were personally taught by Master Di,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
yet you want to write strange tales?

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.960
Are you worthy of his teaching?

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.880
But I have to make a living!

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.960
I can't let everyone support me, can I?

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:02.870
I'd feel ashamed.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:03.960
That pathetic pride of yours

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.790
isn't worth a dime.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.720
Just swallow it.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.640
That's…

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.829
harsh as hell.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.069
Harsh?

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.160
You lost your post

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:14.400
just for now.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.720
Not forever.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.599
Master Di was a wise man.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.250
He saw beyond the horizon.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.720
He valued you

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.270
because he wanted you to become

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.470
a pillar of the state.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.390
Not to have you write stories

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.750
about ghosts and demons

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.010
to fool children.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.400
That's a bit biased.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.110
It's not just children
who read strange tales.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.720
Exactly!

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.480
I love reading about

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.790
gods and monsters.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.400
You see?

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.750
I won't argue with you.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:40.750
In short,

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.440
this path won't work.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.200
I forbid it.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:48.830
I have an idea

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.920
that I've been thinking about for a while.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.580
Since

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.120
everyone is here today,

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.420
may I tell you about it?

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.880
Xijun,

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.670
this is your home.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.110
You're the hostess.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.390
Come over here

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.590
and say whatever you want.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.410
Come on.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.160
Master.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.240
I grew up in Chang'an.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.070
Now that I'm back,

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.440
I've come to love this place

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.670
even more.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.160
I've taken Yingtao

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.750
to all 110 districts.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.800
They are all busy and thriving.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.830
No wonder Chang'an is
the greatest city in the world.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.230
Just talking about food—

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:23.350
delicacies from everywhere

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:24.550
can all be found here,

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.240
except for one thing.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.200
It's something I've been

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.830
dreaming about lately.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.470
We all had it

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.160
in Shazhou Prefecture.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.940
Sushan?

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.880
Yes,

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:40.070
sushan.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.240
If we could bring that Dunhuang treat

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.100
to Chang'an,

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.510
then during the scorching summer,

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:46.770
the people of Chang'an

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.270
would have something wonderful to enjoy.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.030
That would be a worthy deed.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.920
So you want

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.000
to open a shop?

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.880
Yes.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.750
To open a sushan shop.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:57.960
As for the location,

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.750
we could choose Shengye District,

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.590
Pingkang District,

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.960
or the East and West Markets.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.560
It doesn't need to be too big,

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.270
but it can't be too small either.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.070
The decor needs to be refined

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.920
because those who enjoy this delicacy

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.720
aren't just eating to satisfy hunger.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.350
Also,

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.150
we can innovate on its recipe.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.440
Chang'an is different from Shazhou.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.110
We've got way more seasonal fruits.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.900
So sushan

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.930
can have a variety of flavors here.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.030
Rice is expensive in Chang'an,

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.430
and housing even more so.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.200
Opening a shop

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.900
requires a lot of capital.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.100
I can sell one of my houses.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.600
You'll sell this house?

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.550
This was left by Minister Pei.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.720
Besides, we're comfortable living here.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.580
If you sell it, where will we live?

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.600
Fei,

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.680
you clearly don't know

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.940
how rich Miss Xijun is.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.880
Besides this house

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.140
in Chongren District,

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.210
Miss Xijun

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.410
has two more houses in Xuanyang

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.810
and Yanshou Districts.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.480
In such prime locations,

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.540
those houses must be very expensive.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.780
It seems Minister Pei's position

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.280
is quite profitable.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.960
Master Fei.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.050
You misunderstand.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.070
My father only
receives a salary from the court

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.070
and has never taken any dirty money.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.420
These three houses

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.480
were all bought
after we sold our ancestral properties.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.740
My father asked me then

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.460
what I'd do with the money.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.800
I said I'd buy houses.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.750
Because Chang'an is beautiful

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.550
and the heart of the Tang Empire.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.210
Everyone in the world wants to live here.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.510
Xijun, you're remarkable.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.480
If I had

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.610
a daughter like you,

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.240
I wouldn't have spent years

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.970
wandering in the Ghost Market.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.100
Then,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.270
don't call me Miss Pei anymore.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.960
It's Boss Pei now.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.920
-No!
-No!

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.820
Official Lu, you speak first.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.340
Because of Ouyang Quan
from Nanzhou Prefecture

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.310
and Sima Liang from Yunding County,

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:51.480
I have greatly changed my view

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.530
of merchants.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:53.650
But after all,

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.020
Xijun comes from the Pei family of Hedong.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.410
If people find out,

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.830
your family might not tolerate it.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.020
That's true.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.530
If one day

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.920
Minister Pei returns

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.330
and questions this,

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.720
as her sworn brother,

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.520
I wouldn't be able to explain it.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.020
How about this?

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.350
If you trust me, Xijun,

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.270
I can be

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.920
the boss instead.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.770
That won't work either.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.280
You still disagree?

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.310
You'd certainly be good at business.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.110
That's right.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.550
What about your position

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.110
as the Chief of Secret Agents?

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.640
Think carefully.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.110
The secret agents work in secret,

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.650
but they help solve cases,

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:33.960
catch criminals, and protect

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.830
the capital.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.230
And you once said

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.510
you'd devote yourself

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.970
to the people of Chang'an.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.110
Are you going to go back on your word?

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.830
Being the boss of the sushan shop

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.440
and the Chief of Secret Agents

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.750
aren't in conflict!

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.060
As a secret agent,

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.500
you should remain behind the scenes.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.720
If the sushan shop becomes popular,

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.640
everyone in Chang'an

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.860
will recognize you.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.020
How can you stay

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:57.240
in the shadows then?

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.390
That does make sense.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.220
In that case,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.720
who better to run the sushan shop

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.800
than me, Fei Yingjun?

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.130
All in favor, raise your hands.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.560
Master Fei is perfect for this.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:16.840
I agree.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.640
Whether you two raise your hands

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.720
doesn't matter anymore.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.110
There are already four hands.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.170
That's a majority.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.310
From now on,

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:38.550
stop calling me Fei,

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.320
Master Fei,

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.000
or

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.370
Miracle Doctor Fei.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:44.900
You should call me

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.850
Boss Fei!

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.680
I've thought of a name

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.830
for our sushan shop.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:53.510
It'll be called Liuhe Sushan Shop.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.420
The six of us

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.830
will work together as one

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.110
to make a fortune.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.580
Business will be booming!

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.090
Say "business thriving" from now on.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.590
W-What's wrong with "booming"?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.340
It's a taboo—same as the Emperor's name.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.400
I'll say it anyway.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.380
Booming, booming,

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.150
booming!

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.980
Lu Lingfeng,

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.400
it's fine to say it at home.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:21.160
Xiong Qiannian is audacious!

[Crucial Nexus]

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.440
The position
of Criminal Investigation Scholar

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.880
was created by me for Su Wuming.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.080
Doesn't he know that?

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:30.800
Of course he knows.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.250
So you're saying

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.610
Xiong Qiannian
has allied himself with His Majesty?

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.640
We recommended three candidates

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.720
for Yongzhou's Chief Administrator.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.200
His Majesty rejected them all.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:40.840
Now,

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.790
Xiong has suddenly taken that post,

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.690
clearly becoming
His Majesty's loyal supporter.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.910
So as soon as he took office,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.070
he kicked Su Wuming

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.070
out of Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.630
This is clearly targeted at me.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.420
Forgive my frankness,

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.520
but this might not be a bad thing.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:59.510
What do you mean?

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.430
Su Wuming,

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:02.240
though promoted by Your Highness,

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.040
may not be

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.200
completely loyal to you.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.110
Think about the Mount Zhongnan trip.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.370
That nonsense about hearing Bai Ze's cry

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.000
was clearly meant to protect

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.480
His Majesty's reputation.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.350
Without a doubt,

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.240
it must have been

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.980
fabricated by Su Wuming.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.810
He plays both sides.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.340
Not someone you can truly rely on.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.400
Unlike you—utterly loyal.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:27.790
I promoted him

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.200
at the wrong time.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.240
Su Wuming

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.110
was demoted from Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review Court,

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.880
and now, he's even lost his title

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.350
as Criminal Investigation Scholar.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.280
His life has truly hit rock bottom.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.670
If I give him a hand now,

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.310
he'd surely be deeply grateful to me.

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.950
Give him a job at the Princess's Mansion.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.450

No, he hasn't,

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.300
but he's opened a shop

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:52.960
and tasted it herself.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.800
This thing must taste amazing.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.590
Exactly!

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.590
Who was saying earlier

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:57.690
that it might upset the stomach?

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.150
That's nonsense!

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.370
You were the one who said it.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.630
You said it.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.710
Did I say that?

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.480
To eat the same food

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.440
as the Princess,

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.960
even if I get a stomachache,
I'll accept it!

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.050
After the Princess leaves,

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.840
I'll be the first one to enter the shop

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.760
to eat sushan.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:13.480
Right.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:14.330
Me too.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:15.360
I'll eat sushan.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.290
I'll eat sushan.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.190
Chancellor Cui, your sushan is ready.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.840
Since you didn't actually
go into business,

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.970
come serve in the Princess's Mansion.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.880
You'll start as a Consultant Official,

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.510
then be promoted to Chief Administrator.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.440
Happy with that?

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.700
Your Highness,

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.840
perhaps not.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.030
Do you find the position too low?

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.400
Then how about the Princess's Consultant?

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.260
I don't find the position too low.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.290
I just...

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.360
I can't bear to leave Lu Lingfeng.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.550
Although I am no longer
the Criminal Investigation Scholar,

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.150
I'm still the Chief of Secret Agents,
aren't I?

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.740
This post,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.270
though not an official position,

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.840
is extremely important

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.880
to the Judicial Official.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:15.840
Since Lu Lingfeng took office

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.920
in Yongzhou Prefecture,

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.840
he's established the Mobile Court,

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.280
handling cases in each district

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.940
and winning people's hearts.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.840
However,

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:24.880
the capital

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.330
has a population of over a million.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.510
The backlog of cases is truly too large.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.190
I'm afraid Lu Lingfeng

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.940
will collapse from overwork.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.360
Therefore, I beg you, Your Highness,

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.880
to allow me to stay by his side

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.810
to offer him advice and strategies

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.320
and help solve his problems.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:45.150
Rest assured, Your Highness,

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.320
I will do my utmost

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.320
to assist him.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:55.370
Are you saying that

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.030
because you are afraid

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:58.510
of offending that person?

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.590
With Your Highness valuing me so highly,

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.590
within the Tang Empire,

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:05.550
who would I have to fear?

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.480
Don't play dumb.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.890
However, I do approve

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.230
of your excuse.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:15.000
My son, Lu Lingfeng,

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:16.590
truly needs someone like you

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.920
to assist him.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.080
Before long,

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.100
my son will surely
rise to the highest ranks.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:24.400
By then,

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.920
you won't be beneath him in status.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.050
In that case,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.460
thank you, Your Highness.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.110
Get Pei Xijun here.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.220
Your Highness.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.180
Sit.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:00.460
I dare not.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.360
If I tell you to sit, then sit.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.420
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.760
My son is stubborn.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.710
Do you often argue with him?

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.600
Sometimes we do.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.930
But he always gives in to me.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:24.690
Then he treats you much better
than he treats me.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.510
The other day,
when I went to check on his injury,

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.090
we got into an argument.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.230
He wouldn't budge an inch.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.170
Lu Lingfeng must have

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.930
been tormented by his pain

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.490
and spoken some nonsense.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.700
Although Lu Lingfeng is reserved,

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.310
he is not a fickle person.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:45.520
In the future,

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.760
he will surely treat you well.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.340
The shop is opening today.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:54.240
Why didn't Lu Lingfeng come?

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.320
He's busy with official duties.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.980
The Mobile Court
is in Qinglong District today.

00:38:59.620 --> 00:38:59.800
[Qinglong District]

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.130
-Hurry up.
-Wait for me.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.160
-It's starting.
-Let's go.

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:21.220
Well, basically,

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.480
that's what happened.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.170
It can hardly be called a case.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.000
If we're late,
there won't be any seats left.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.510
Maybe I won't report it.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:31.630
My neighbors and I

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:32.750
will just resolve it ourselves.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.210
It's not a big deal anyway.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:35.230
All right.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.010
Try to get along with your neighbors.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.230
I'll remember that.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.890
Hurry up!

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.230
Come on, hurry!

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.210
Official Lu.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:45.480
This is too much!

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.280
I'll go chase them away!

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:51.920
Qinglong District has no unsolved cases.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.350
No one is seeking justice.

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:54.680
No one has gone missing.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.800
And there is singing and dancing.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:57.960
Isn't this exactly what

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.220
we've been hoping for?

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.630
What kind of dance is that?

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.630
So many people are watching.

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:02.510
Actually,

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.630
everyone is here to see

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:04.510
Hongyao.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.710
Who is Hongyao?

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.150
The one playing the pipa.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:08.920
She used to be the top courtesan
in Pingkang District.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.720
She is famous.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.840
Then let’s go take a look too.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.840
No one is filing a complaint anyway.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.120
[Hongyao]
