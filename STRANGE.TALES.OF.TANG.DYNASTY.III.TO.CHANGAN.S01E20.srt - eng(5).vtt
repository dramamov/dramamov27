[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.930
[Episode 20]

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.759
Sir, one more serving.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.560
Okay, coming right up.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.990
Scholar,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.920
stop reading.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.930
I'm really overwhelmed with work.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.030
It would be nice
if you could help serve customers.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.789
Yingtao,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.170
I'll leave the Sushan Shop to you for now.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.710
Hurry up, you over there!

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.710
Fei, come with me.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.710
What for?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.840
Where is he?

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.360
Fei!

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.960
I knocked him out in drinking, huh?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.410
How...

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.030
How dare he claim to have never been
drunk in the Tang Empire?

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.890
What a bragger!

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.360
I am the real unmatched
drinking champion in Chang'an.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.400
Seven years ago,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.670
right before the imperial exam,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.079
my classmates and I

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.540
went to Pingkang District

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.400
for a few drinks to unwind a bit.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.030
We met Hongyao

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.890
on the same day.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.800
But Hongyao didn't even

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.150
spare him a single glance.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.240
Words like "charismatic"

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.440
or "handsome" simply

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.930
had nothing to do with him.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.310
Before coming to Chang'an for the exam,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.310
he was just a country snake catcher.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.710
You...

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.470
He was poor and extremely stingy.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.030
Who would fall for someone like you?

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.280
That being the case,

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.850
seven years ago, you and Hongyao were...

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.000
An inseparable

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.100
perfect match.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.000
That's why I was envied

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.400
by my classmates so much.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.280
Naturally, he was also jealous of me.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.680
You messed with and ditched her.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.810
You failed Hongyao!

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.470
I didn't take Hongyao with me,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.800
but that was because...

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.960
Before the selection exam
of the Ministry of Personnel,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.360
I sent the chief examiner

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.280
some local specialties.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.960
I later learned that it's common practice.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.120
But back then, I felt

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.150
that I had done something shameful

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.750
and feared it might
put my career in danger.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.590
So I left overnight as soon as I

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.710
received my appointment.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.560
I couldn't take Hongyao

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.690
with me as my family.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.079
I do regret it somewhat.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.079
I was young then, and didn't know

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.110
how to cherish what I had.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.280
Meng Buyi,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.400
how did Hongyao

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.880
end up marrying you?

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.760
Don't do this.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.520
Shame on you, Meng Buyi!

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.800
You used her vulnerability

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.120
to win Hongyao's heart!

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.850
Yan Junxian,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.720
Hongyao almost
committed suicide because of you.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.240
I don't think it's appropriate

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.240
for you to say so.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.780
Not long after,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.680
I got a position
in the Ministry of Revenue.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.630
With a glimmer of hope,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.890
I went to find Hongyao.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.870
I thought,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.920
even if she rejected me,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.050
it wouldn't matter.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.730
If in this life,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.190
I couldn't even express my true feelings,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.000
that would be my greatest regret.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.830
Unexpectedly,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.760
Hongyao said yes

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.070
and agreed

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.510
to marry me.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.830
Fei.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.810
Come check this out.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.890
This is...

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.560
A snake scale?

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.600
A snake scale.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:19.860
Zhang San

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.490
must have been strangled by a snake first,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.160
then stabbed with scissors.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.480
And it's even purple.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.430
When my mentor, Master Di,

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.480
taught me autopsy techniques,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.230
he specifically told me how to tell apart

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.070
animals with fur, feathers, scales,

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.720
shells, and those with nothing.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.040
But whether there are actually

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.190
purple snakes,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.950
I'm a bit unsure at the moment.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.460
[Strange Tales from the Western Capital
By Meng Buyi]

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.430
Let me finish reading this part,

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.159
and I might find the answer.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.930
Finish reading?

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.880
Hey,

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.160
can you go somewhere else

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.360
to read strange tales?

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.690
This place is so gloomy.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.730
Doesn't it give you the creeps?

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.150
Hongyao was a pipa player

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.950
and spent years in entertainment houses.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.360
She had an open, energetic personality

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.760
and loved lively places.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.160
While I am the quiet type.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.830
So, within two years of our marriage,

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.960
we began to quarrel.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.360
All these years,

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.630
I've been writing

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.430
strange tales and supernatural stories

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.950
about ghosts and monsters,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.950
with hardly a hint of romance.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.090
So the conflicts between us

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.130
only got worse.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.040
Hongyao was from Youzhou.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.190
After she came to Chang'an,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.610
she went straight to Pingkang District.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.210
She was actually unfamiliar
with the capital.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.520
She once asked me
to show her around Chang'an.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.680
But I was afraid of the high expense,

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.460
so I turned her down
with the excuse of being busy

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.090
with work.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.710
Now that I think about it,

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.510
I really shouldn't have done that.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.040
You really shouldn't have!

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.830
For a while,

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.830
whenever we had a fight,

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.510
she would go
to the small square in the district

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.510
to play the pipa

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:11.810
for the dancers.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.830
As time went by,

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.960
it became her habit.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.980
I was

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.650
so worried about this.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.720
Although the dancers were

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.780
mostly women,

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.870
the spectators were mainly men.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.930
So I often dreamed that she...

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.870
So I felt restless

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.390
and couldn't even fall asleep.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.510
So you couldn't sleep well

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.480
because you suspected Hongyao?

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.430
Had I known, I wouldn't have

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.090
given you any prescriptions.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.030
Just tell the facts

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.780
and don't slander each other.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.650
So was I wrong to be suspicious?

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.280
After his return to Chang'an,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.610
he often used the excuse

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.750
of visiting his classmate
to drop by my house.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.040
That was all for Hongyao!

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.750
Hongyao returned to my embrace

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.190
because you kept hiding the difference

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.630
between an official and a clerk,

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.230
which really irritated her.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.800
She returned to where?

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.360
Say that again.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.210
Returned to your "embrace"!

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.470
I-I said

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.600
she returned to my embrace,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.950
and it's just a figure of speech.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.310
It never happened, actually.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.920
I visited his place last night,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.510
and it was also because Hongyao begged me

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.310
to find a way to help

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.870
this good-for-nothing man of hers

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.360
get promoted from clerk to official.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.920
Who would believe that?

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.300
For the thing you said,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.160
was it necessary for you
to take off your shoes and get into bed?

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.560
Yes,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.920
Hongyao and I opened up to each other,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.190
and feelings prevailed.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.390
I did take off my boots

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.360
and got into bed.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:23.780
Hongyao,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.200
let's leave Chang'an

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.620
and go somewhere far away,

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:29.560
somewhere no one

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.360
knows who we are.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.560
How is that possible?

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.909
You'll give up your position?

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:33.480
For you,

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.880
I'm willing to do so.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:39.610
What...

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.780
Isn't Meng Buyi on night duty?

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.480
Yes.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.860
Why did he suddenly come back?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.320
Come on, get inside quickly.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:48.890
Hurry up.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.150
So you were hiding under the bed.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.000
If I had known then,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.320
I should have dragged you out!

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.980
The one who came in wasn't you.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.470
Was it Zhang San, the mutton soup seller
from Qinglong District?

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.910
I did hear Hongyao call him

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:02.600
Zhang San.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.440
Under the bed at that time,

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.370
I found that I had

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.830
forgotten to hide my boots well.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:13.670
Why is it you?

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.020
What? You didn't expect this?

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.360
Have you made an appointment
with another lover?

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.270
Zhang San,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.140
you scoundrel, get out!

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.400
W-What are you doing?

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.340
What am I doing?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.610
What do you think I'm doing?

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.840
D-Don't come any closer.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.840
Or I'll scream for help.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.030
Go ahead and scream.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.440
It's been quite a while

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.910
since I heard you scream last time.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:33.960
Back in the day,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.820
when I was rich,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.000
I also kept you as my lover,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.440
the top courtesan of Pingkang District.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.770
I'm a married woman now,

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.910
not who I used to be.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.390
I-If you don't leave,

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.720
I'll call the officers to catch you!

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.380
Call the officers to catch me?

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.270
Don't think I'm trying
to make out with you.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.120
Let me get to the point.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.180
Where's the money?

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.240
My husband is just a minor clerk
in the Ministry of Revenue.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.840
We don't have any money left.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.120
You know I'm not gullible.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.790
If you don't tell me

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.670
where your money is,

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.200
I'll strangle you to death!

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.320
Isn't your husband

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.000
on night duty at the county office?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.630
As beautiful as I am, my husband

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.510
can't rest assured leaving me alone.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.030
He returns to check on me
at a fixed time every night.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.630
Otherwise, how would I

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.230
have opened the door for you?

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.170
W-What are you going to do?

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.410
I'll kill him.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.630
No, you can't.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.390
My husband is a Secretary
in the Ministry of Revenue.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.330
If you kill him,

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.670
you'll lose your life as well,

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.600
unable to get away with it anymore.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.530
I'll hide... I'll go hide myself.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.020
No, not there!

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:39.980
Here, here.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.280
Come, get in.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.450
Keep quiet about it.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.480
Or I'll kill both of you!

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.500
Okay.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.810
The next one who came in was you.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.470
After Meng Buyi left,

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.080
I heard clangs

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.600
from that cabinet

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.390
and Zhang San's continuous

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.380
low groans.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.640
It was so terrifying

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.430
that I was scared, too.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.350
Honey,

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.670
come out quickly.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.780
Shoes, your shoes.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:26.420
Hurry.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:29.700
Go quickly.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.740
As I expected!

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.550
Yan Junxian confessed!

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.390
He was the one

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.680
who took Hongyao away!

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.360
Tell me

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.090
where you've hidden my wife!

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.660
-Give my wife back!
-Stop!

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.660
Meng Buyi!

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.420
You...

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.650
I didn't take Hongyao away.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.570
Last night,

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.270
she walked me

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.510
to the small square in Qinglong District

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.750
and told me to go first,

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.080
and then she went back herself!

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.740
After that,

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.510
you've never seen Hongyao again?

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.200
No!

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.150
I, Yan Junxian, am an official
of the court.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.960
I've already admitted

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.840
such a shameful thing.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.100
What else would I hide?

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:09.750
What do you think?

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.350
This case is quite interesting.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.750
What's clear stands out.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.350
What's murky is buried deep.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.750
"What's clear stands out.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.020
What's murky is buried deep."

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:23.750
Well said.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.630
Neither Yan Junxian

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.980
nor Meng Buyi is simple.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.530
They seem to have come clean,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.780
yet they are still hiding something.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.030
You're right,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.600
I have the same thoughts.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.630
Based on the current testimonies,

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.240
there's no substantial evidence
against either of them.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.770
We had to let them go for now.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.630
Thankfully, you drew

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.630
Hongyao's portrait.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.360
I've ordered

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.910
a hundred copies to be made

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.240
and distributed
to all night shift officers in the city

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.790
-to search for her in full force.
-Lu Lingfeng!

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:52.600
I got it!

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:53.880
I've figured it out!

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.910
It was a snake.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.390
Here's my preliminary conclusion.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.390
There was a purple snake

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.080
that attacked Zhang San

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.520
in that wardrobe

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.000
and coiled around his neck,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.810
causing him to lose consciousness

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.270
and fall out of the wardrobe.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:13.600
Thus,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.630
the blade

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.670
that Zhang San held had no blood on it

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.670
and just fell beside him.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.030
Wuming, you're a genius.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.530
It matches perfectly

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.690
with Yan Junxian's testimony.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.020
I heard Hongyao call him

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.010
Zhang San.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.150
According to Yan Junxian's words,

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.200
Zhang San seemed

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.060
to be fighting

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.410
a snake in the wardrobe.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.390
But a purple snake?

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.320
I've never heard
of such a thing in my life.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.520
But this book of strange tales mentions

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.000
that there's an island

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.630
called Dongyi.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.670
Though it's far across the sea,

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.670
the island rulers throughout generations

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.870
have all claimed
to be scions of Emperor Shun.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.520
The island abounds
with strange rocks and unusual trees,

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.450
and is home to all sorts of animals.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.870
Most of the islanders

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.790
have short hair
and tattoos on their bodies,

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.750
mastering mysterious sorceries.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.270
When the Tang Dynasty was just founded,

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.400
during the Wude era,

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.960
the Ruler of Dongyi Island
traveled for months

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.000
to reach Chang'an.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.790
But he felt he wasn't properly received

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.390
by the Court of State Ceremonials.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.890
So he held a grudge

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.350
and dumped all the specialties he brought

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.090
into the Qu River.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.630
Among them, there was

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.880
an extremely precious medicinal herb

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.290
called Perfect Purple.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.440
A medicinal herb?

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.480
What does it have to do with snakes?

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.870
It's a snake gallbladder.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.030
This Perfect Purple is

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.090
both the name of an herb

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.640
and the name of a snake.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.600
It's priceless

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.030
because the gallbladder must be taken out
while the snake is alive.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.230
It can not only detoxify and heal sores.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.490
Most importantly,

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.240
it's said to be able to bring

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.750
dead people back to life!

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.600
So,

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.240
what they dumped into the Qu River were

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.440
all live snakes?

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.280
That's right.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.530
Legend has it

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.000
that these snakes
live extremely long lives.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.810
Each one

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.190
can live for over 60 years.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.510
What's more amazing about it is

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.390
that when the snake hits 60,

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.780
its tongue goes from red to purple.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.320
And only at this time,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.550
the gallbladder extracted,

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.360
while it's alive, is most valuable.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.550
I remember now.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.080
It's definitely not just a legend.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.200
My old mentor

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.870
once used Perfect Purple

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.180
to bring someone back to life

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.600
from the brink of death.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.950
Wait a moment.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.070
I remember Yan Junxian also said...

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.270
Before coming to Chang'an for the exam,

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.270
he was just a country snake catcher.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:23.880
You...

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.260
[Fair & Square]

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.630
It seems that I need to go

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.360
visit the Meng Residence again.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.390
I need to confirm

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.870
if Zhang San's death was

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.100
directly related

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.910
to this Perfect Purple.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.330
But Meng Buyi is

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.540
a hard nut to crack.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.320
Even if Zhang San was

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.960
truly strangled to death by a snake,

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.840
he would never admit

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.120
it had anything to do with him.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.670
After all, the Qinglong District is
close to the Qu River.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.340
He would say

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.910
the snake crawled
into his house on its own.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.280
That's right.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.670
Since Perfect Purple really exists,

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.630
the most expensive pharmacies in Chang'an

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:55.830
must have some leads.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.410
After all, these pharmacy owners are

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.880
the wealthiest people.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:00.720
For something like this,

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.440
a medicine that can
bring people back to life,

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.640
someone will buy it no matter the price.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.320
Also,

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.480
Yan Junxian is
a deputy chief imperial physician.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.270
Perhaps

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:13.200
the Perfect Purple came
from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.520
Then we should

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.120
split up.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.400
Have you ever seen a purple snake?

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.530
-No.
-No, I haven't.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.440
A purple snake?

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.170
It's said every spring,

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.270
for His Majesty's safety
during his spring outings,

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.910
the Palace Secretariat would clear

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.480
all snakes along the Qu River.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.360
The ones caught are

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.270
sometimes sent to the herb gardens nearby.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.200
I only became the deputy chief
imperial physician this year

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.440
and started managing this herb garden.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.600
Shortly after I assumed the post,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.240
they brought here a purple snake,

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.120
saying it had medicinal properties.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.120
But I truly didn't know how to use it.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.270
Where is the snake now?

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.550
No one in the herb garden
knew how to keep it.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.670
It wouldn't eat anything we fed it.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.120
After some time, it disappeared.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.750
I guess it burrowed into the ground

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.480
and escaped.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.970
Come with me.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.140
Follow me this way.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.030
Please.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:58.380
Official Lu,

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.850
you still suspect I abducted Hongyao?

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.220
I didn't hide Hongyao!

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.510
What's the point of searching

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.970
for her in the herb garden?

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.109
They're not looking for a person,

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:10.440
but for a snake.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.010
Has that escaped Perfect Purple

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.170
ever hurt anyone?

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.550
No.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.710
This place is not far from the Qu River.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:18.880
Wild flowers and trees abound there.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.569
The snake probably crawled
back to the Qu River.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.569
How long has the snake been missing?

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.750
Two months.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.000
I remember when the snake disappeared,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.310
Meng Buyi happened to visit me.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.350
I was prescribing

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.100
sleep-inducing herbs for him.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.160
Mr. Yan, did you study medicine

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.400
through a family tradition?

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:37.960
No.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.400
Then did you learn from a medical master?

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.250
No.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:42.760
It was just fate.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.240
The county I governed these years is known

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.770
for producing Gastrodia.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.590
It's offered to the court every year.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.480
Over time,

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.320
I developed

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.750
some knowledge of herbs.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.240
After the new Emperor ascended the throne,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.570
he particularly valued Gastrodia.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:56.900
So I had the opportunity

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.200
to become the deputy chief physician

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.800
and herb garden supervisor.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.160
Though it's the eighth rank,

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.830
it's treated as the fifth rank.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.400
I can wear a light crimson robe

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.400
and was granted
a silver fish-pattern pouch.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.830
This made Meng Buyi,

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.680
that petty clerk, even more jealous,

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.540
so he framed me.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:12.540
Let me say this again.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.200
Last night,

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.130
I did leave together with Hongyao.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:15.880
But after she walked me

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.070
to the small square in Qinglong District,

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.130
she just went back.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.810
Her disappearance
has nothing to do with me.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:25.880
If you continue

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.020
to harass me like this,

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.790
when I have an audience with His Majesty,

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.720
I will certainly file a complaint.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.170
Mr. Yan, are you threatening us?

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.680
When you were young,
you studied with His Majesty.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.610
You spent day and night together.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.000
You know His Majesty best.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.570
Would he fail
to distinguish right from wrong

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.500
and believe others' accusations?

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:49.280
Mr. Yan,

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.570
my men

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.270
will search the herb garden thoroughly.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.920
That snake could hurt people.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.590
It's also

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.070
for the sake of your safety.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.670
Of course,

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.880
there are so many buildings
in your herb garden.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.750
If someone is hiding in a secret spot

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.030
and you haven't discovered it,

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.700
they will help you find her.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.070
Goodbye.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.730
Take care, Official Lu.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.510
Fei,

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.320
hurry up,

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.320
bring the candle over here.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.970
Hold it higher.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.620
This is a snake scale.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.900
We didn't notice it

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.710
during the last inspection.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:49.760
Su Wuming.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.090
I think there's more than just scales.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.070
Don't panic.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.440
This snake isn't venomous,

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.570
and it doesn't bite.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.960
It just likes to coil around things.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.390
You...

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.400
Do not struggle against it.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.860
The more you resist, the tighter it wraps.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.000
Fei,

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.590
help me!

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.250
This snake must fear mugwort.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.010
Here comes the mugwort.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.480
The snake does fear mugwort,

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.540
but the smoke makes it more agitated.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.270
Pacify it. pacify it.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.240
Pacify...

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.200
Agarwood!

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.000
Mugwort is too strong.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.030
The opposite of that is

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.540
gentle agarwood.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.280
This snake must like agarwood.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:42.860
Su Wuming.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:43.840
Su Wuming!

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.550
The snake is gone.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.720
Stop playing dead.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:51.450
Su Wuming?

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.680
Did I get you killed?

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.320
Well...

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.430
One, two, three.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:11.650
No way.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.200
Three taps should have woken him up.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.640
How am I going to explain this to Yingtao?

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.240
Oh, God...

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.040
One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.750
seven, eight, nine.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.420
You're awake.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.250
Finally.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.470
Zhang San.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.130
What did you say?

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.160
Zhang San

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.660
must have been strangled to death
by this snake.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.770
But who caused the blade wound

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.470
on his neck?

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.880
According to Jiang's testimony...

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:52.430
Was it Hongyao?

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.710
But why would she do that?

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.590
You were on the brink of death,

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.750
yet you're still thinking
about others instead of yourself.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:59.940
If you had died,

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.790
how would Yingtao feel?

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.480
It won't be easy

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.160
to check pharmacies.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.280
There are
over a hundred pharmacies in Chang'an.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.700
Where should we start?

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:53.610
Yan Junxian also visited last night.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.440
Although I don't know much about the case,

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.750
that does make some sense.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.550
It's just that Meng Buyi is not home yet.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.610
Perhaps he's still on night duty

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.120
at the Ministry of Revenue.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.590
[Ming Shi's Private Estate]

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.880
You finally came.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.030
I'm here to tell you

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.730
to stay away from Yan Junxian.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.830
Seven years ago,

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.200
it was you who separated

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.240
me and Yan, right?

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.750
Back then, I often hid in the corner.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.810
You actually remember me?

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.040
Of course I do.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.640
Master,

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:57.570
it's time to study.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.850
I'm fully prepared.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:01.310
The imperial exam is approaching.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.850
Shouldn't you be hitting the books?

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:03.920
Have you forgotten

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.820
the grand ambition you pledged in Lingnan?

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:12.510
I should go.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.500
I didn't let Yan Junxian get close to you

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.200
because I feared he would
indulge in romance

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.310
and fail to win the Metropolitan Graduate.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.000
Was I wrong?

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.750
After being appointed as an official,

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.950
he abandoned me without saying goodbye.

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.200
Was that also your idea?

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:32.590
Yes,

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.720
so what?

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.750
You're just a servant.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.000
Why are you meddling

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.460
in your master's affairs?

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.320
It's none of your business.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.070
Actually, what confuses me most is

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.600
why your master

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.270
would listen

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.160
to a mere servant like you.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:56.990
Don't ask about that.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:58.790
It's not good for you.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.110
How so?

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.640
Your life could be at stake.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.880
What if I insist on asking?

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.050
Take your hands off.

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:20.980
I came here to drive you away.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.280
Or I'll kill you.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.800
Go ahead.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.320
I'm willing to be killed by you.

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.050
You were in the shadows all along,

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.110
but you kept watching me.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.880
Yan Junxian and I

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.280
seemed to be in love with each other.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.360
But who would know

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:51.880
that deep down inside,

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.739
I actually fell for someone else.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.760
You should leave.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.980
If you keep this up,

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.280
it will ruin Yan Junxian's career.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.340
Don't bring him up.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:12.120
Do you still have no idea

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.670
who I truly love?

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.760
The first time I met you,

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.250
I just deeply fell in love with you.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.620
At that time,

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.660
I only thought you were

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.130
a way too beautiful woman.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.820
You would stand in Yan Junxian's way.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.350
Back then,

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.360
I only thought you were

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.290
so dull

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.450
that you couldn't read my heart at all.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:22.770
I'm not young anymore.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.740
Matters of love belong

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.340
to talented scholars and beautiful ladies,

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:29.500
but not to me.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.760
You lied so calmly.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.550
You must have been

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.360
through ups and downs.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.510
Talented scholars and beautiful ladies...

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.840
That's just a fairy tale to fool children.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:50.030
Since I married Meng Buyi years ago,

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.830
I've never had true love for him.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.650
I've been thinking only of you.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.920
I guess

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.700
your past must be extraordinary.

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:01.930
Am I right?

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.060
What exactly do you know?

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.950
Seven years ago, when we first met,

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.670
before I left home,

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.800
I did the fortune-telling for myself.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:18.930
The divination said

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.230
that I would meet

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.080
my life-long true love that day.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.450
The moment our eyes met,

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.880
I knew that person was you.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.710
But I didn't expect...

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.160
Why didn't you come back
to see me even once?

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.170
Do you regret it?

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.710
Regret?

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.070
I regret that when I first

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.110
laid eyes on you,

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.430
I was still hiding in the corner.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.960
Back then, I didn't allow Yan Junxian
to approach you.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.280
I thought it was because

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.030
I feared he would be lost in romance,

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:14.230
and it would ruin the future

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:15.520
I had planned for him.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:17.100
But now I think about it,

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.710
I already considered you mine.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:22.960
When you and Yan Junxian

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.960
served in office in that remote county,

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.060
did you ever dream of me?

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:33.070
I actually did.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:34.720
I dreamed that you

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.100
blamed me for breaking up a loving couple

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.670
and wanted to kill me.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.590
That was because

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:47.360
I dreamed of you every day.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.030
Each dream brought more hatred,

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.800
until the resentment gathered

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.280
and finally reached you
thousands of miles away.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.470
Hongyao,

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:01.880
you made me change

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.180
all my previous thoughts in a single day.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.840
I painstakingly nurtured Yan Junxian

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.110
and planned to use him to help me

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:09.000
become the power
behind the throne in Chang'an.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.990
For this goal,

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.680
I spent a fortune

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.570
and invested ten years of my life.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:14.360
But now,

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.510
I can give it all up.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.700
I want to take you away.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:19.480
I've long been tired

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.940
of suffering in Chang'an.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.150
Then I'll take you back to Lingnan.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.880
It's beautiful there
with mountains and rivers.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.930
My mansion is

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:27.490
the largest and finest

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:28.590
in that area.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.980
My private villa is

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:31.280
way larger than the herb garden

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.340
of the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.580
If I go back with you,

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.210
would you make me the mistress

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:43.670
of that mansion and villa?

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.840
Of course.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:47.230
I mean

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:49.760
the real mistress.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.630
I, Ming Shi,

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.980
have never married anyone in my life.

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:55.360
After returning to Lingnan,

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.560
I will hold a grand wedding to marry you.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.190
Aren't you afraid

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.600
that I might fall for another man

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.010
and betray you?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.110
If I revealed my former identity,

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:14.550
I'm afraid

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.510
you would never dare betray me.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.070
I knew it.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.250
Your past was amazing.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.180
But instead of "extraordinary,"

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.420
it was rather bloody.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.550
That makes it even more intriguing.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:36.710
I'm willing

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.920
to wash mint leaves for you every day

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:39.960
as your snacks.

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:42.310
You can enjoy them

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.450
while telling me stories of your past.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.510
If we could really live

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.630
such a life,

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.000
even if I'm going to die,

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.030
it'll be worth it.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:00.740
What about him?

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:07.450
I already spotted you.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.650
You

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.230
will always be

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.440
just a lame moorhen.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.380
Be careful!

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:52.700
[Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.550
Who is it?

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.670
Meng Buyi?

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.360
Why did you beat the drum again?

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.190
I've found out Hongyao's whereabouts.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.370
Please go save her now!
