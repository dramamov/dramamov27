kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.600
All seven of them , age, job,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.040
environment, and family ,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.560
nothing connects them.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.560
- Which one’s the latest?
- Phakaphong, the transgender.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.400
Have our informant find out
what this talisman means.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.920
Looks like the victim got
cursed for messing with magic.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.080
It’ll take a while
before we can close this case.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.000
I just want you to go back
to how you used to be.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.200
There was a similar case in Chiang Mai.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.479
Same corpse marks, same setup.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.000
Fifteen years ago in Sisaket.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.160
Ten years ago in Phang Nga.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.080
Five years ago in Chiang Mai. Now, Bangkok.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.840
Or Killer strikes every five years?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.560
Due to Colonel Singha Wetarak’s

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.280
negligence,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.400
the suspect’s death occurred.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.160
Hereby removed from his position

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.720
pending further investigation
until the next stage of inquiry.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.800
Oh, P'Sing.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.560
If the commander doesn’t approve,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.840
should I tell the team heading upcountry

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.520
to pause for now?

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.720
No need.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.120
We stick to the original plan.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.479
We have to close this case fast,
before it’s too late.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.320
Call back everyone
from the provincial fieldwork.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.160
Have them continue
the probe at the next victim’s house.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.479
Roger that.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.960
What are you doing?

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.880
Uh, nothing.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.200
I was waiting, so I doodled a bit.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.520
Heading out for a bit.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.600
Where to?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.040
Victim’s house.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.479
I’ll just wait in the room.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.160
Don’t wanna bother you.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.520
I’d feel bad.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.880
What’s wrong with you?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.400
Weren’t you the one who wanted to
stay close ’cause of ghosts?

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.360
But I told you to come along, but you held back.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.400
So what do you actually want?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.760
Uh, I...

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.000
You’re the only witness
and spiritual consultant in this case.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.880
Do whatever I tell you to do.

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.440
From now on, if any other cop
orders you around, ignore them.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.880
Only listen to me.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.040
Got it?

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.720
Yes.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.560
Hurry up.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.000
(Goddess Bless You From Death)

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.800
Sey.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.920
Can I take a day off today?

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.200
Submit your leave form
to the section chief here.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.160
Just thinking about
what I have to do today is exhausting.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.000
No way.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.400
It’s a big case. I can’t handle it alone.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.800
You need to help me coordinate
with the provincial hospitals today.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.880
And cross-check the cases too.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.120
Yeah.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.680
Got it.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.200
Then let’s split up.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.760
See you at the hospital.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.120
What?

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.560
You should stop those habits.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.280
No touching outside the bed.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.080
It’s not the same anymore.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.520
Get that straight.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.000
Hey, what’s up?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.560
You coming to my place tonight?

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.800
Don’t think so.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.960
Busy with work.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.840
I invited a bunch of hot people, man.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.440
All your type.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.560
Maybe you’ll finally get a new lover.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.480
But...

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.480
- I...
- Or you’ll never move on from the old one.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.480
See you tonight, man.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.000
Who were you talking to?

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.720
A friend.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.600
You set this up?

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.800
Heh, not me.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.720
Sey didn’t ask you to come.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.920
I went to Sey’s condo last night.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.280
Didn’t see him there.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.400
So I thought I’d try here.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.800
You two back together or what?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.520
Whether we are or not,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.280
it’s none of your business.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.040
But if you’re that curious, I’ll answer.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.680
We’re not getting back together.

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:50.520
Even if everything feels the same.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.520
So why are you here?

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.240
If P'King needs anything for the case,

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.120
you should come see us
at the forensic institute.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.640
Why?

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.200
Just like before.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.240
Me, Singha, and you two,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.160
we used to work cases together.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.960
So why can’t I come see you now?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.400
Like I said,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.000
everything may look the same,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.920
but it’s not the same.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.520
I’m actually here about the case.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.800
But not about the autopsy report.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.680
I want to know about the kid staying with Singha.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:41.280
I’ll give you one chance to answer properly,
is that kid a witness,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.600
or… what exactly is he in this case?

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.560
Here’s the warrant.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.960
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.960
Hello.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.040
P'Sing.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.840
I invited Khun Koi, the neighbor,

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.880
and Khun Ton, the village committee head,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.000
to witness the house inspection.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.000
Khun Koi said he hasn’t left home for days.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.840
Khun Thee?

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.440
Khun Thee, are you there? Khun Thee!

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.320
Even his Dharma radio hasn’t been on.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.120
Until they realized he was gone.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.560
Hmm.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.400
Inspector.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.920
After his wife passed away,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.680
he started listening to Dharma radio,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.520
and turned more toward religion.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.280
His daily routine was quiet, avoiding people.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.880
He mostly kept to himself.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.400
Split up and search the place.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.680
Each victim must have
something that connects them.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.720
We just need to find what it is.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.200
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.080
Stay here for now.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.760
Okay.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.880
Help!

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.560
Help!

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.160
Help me!

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.480
Help me!

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.680
Help me!

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.040
Help me!

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.520
Help me!

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.680
Help me!

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.280
No signs of struggle.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.480
Means the victim wasn’t attacked here.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.840
After his wife suddenly died of a heart attack,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.600
he started making merit
and visiting temples every day.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.520
And before he went missing,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.000
he had gone to make merit again.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.880
Find out which temple he usually went to.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.200
And take the neighbor in for questioning.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.200
Got it, P'Sing.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.960
Oh, Thup.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.840
Can I use the bathroom for a sec?

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.560
Don’t touch anything.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.320
P'Singha.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.920
P'Singha.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.200
P'Singha.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.280
P'Singha.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.240
P'Singha.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.000
P'Singha.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.839
P'Singha.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.960
P'Singha, help me!

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.720
Thup! Thup!

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.960
Thup! Thup!

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.360
Thup! Thup!

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.520
Thup! Thup!

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.800
Thup!

00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.800
It’s me.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.480
Calm down.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.120
Easy, easy.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.960
Breathe slowly.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.880
Slowly.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.560
Okay?

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.040
Breathe... breathe.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.240
What got you this time?

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.800
Ghosts.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.240
Two of them.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.560
One I’ve never seen before.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.000
A woman.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.600
With white eyes.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.360
And a mouth slit to her ears.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.160
The other one was the owner of this house.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.840
Y-you mean Khun Thee?

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.080
Yes.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.200
You sure you weren’t just hallucinating?

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.280
He vomited out...

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.200
a ghost-summoning talisman.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.440
Same kind you found
at the last victim’s house.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.480
And there was also...

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.080
a Tukkata Siakaban Samoltat,

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.200
with an elephant-shaped head.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.560
Like this?

00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.760
Yes.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.760
The doll’s neck was snapped, just like that.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.840
Now you can’t say
I was just imagining things.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.360
Checked already.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.520
The two talismans are completely identical.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.120
Since you’re the expert in this kind of thing,

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.040
can you tell me,

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.800
where these talismans come from,

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.200
or who’s giving them out?

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.680
If it’s about talismans or cloth talismans,

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.640
any temple could hand them out.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.680
There are hundreds,
thousands of temples in Thailand.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.320
Can you narrow it down a bit?

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.560
I may have grown up in a temple,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.280
but I’m not some mystic-marketing expert.’.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.480
What about this doll?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.800
This kind of doll is called a Tukkata Siakaban.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.440
It’s used in a ritual to dispel misfortune.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.800
They believe every child born into the world

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.960
has a guardian spirit called Mae Sue.
(Mae Sue: Guardian Spirit of a Child)

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.640
Some say Mae Sue protects the child.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.400
But others believe

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.800
she’s the one who brings sickness upon them.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.520
That’s why they perform a Siakaban ritual,

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.520
or a Mae Sue Cleansing Ceremony.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.680
The doll’s left at a crossroads.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.960
Yes, Monk.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.680
Grandmaster Monk once told me

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.960
I went through that ritual myself as a kid.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.760
Villagers believe that

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.320
the clay doll represents that child.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.040
Once the spirit Mae Sue takes the doll,

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.840
it won’t harm the child again.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.920
These rituals vary from place to place.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.480
I’m not even sure

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.040
if they always have to break the head.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.160
But honestly,

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.160
no one ever takes a doll like that home.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.840
It’s bad energy.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.960
Then can you explain

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.800
why this dead person

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.920
buried the doll in their garden?

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.560
A doll with its head broken,

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.640
wrapped in a cloth talisman,

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.800
a ghost-summoning talisman,

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.240
and buried underground.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.440
I think someone cursed them.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.520
When that happens, their life force weakens.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.080
And spirits can harm them.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.360
All that... just from one doll?

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.440
P'Sing,

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.320
don’t mock what you don’t believe.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.720
I’ve heard of people
who really use black magic.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.880
Maybe Khun Thee thought bringing
that stuff home was good luck.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.520
Even if temples hand out cloth talismans,

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.280
dolls like these,

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.160
no temple would ever give them out.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.000
Only from...

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.640
a shaman’s house,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.440
or a medium’s shrine.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.000
Not like I have many options.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.280
But we’ll never know till we try.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.200
Track both victims for me.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.600
See if they ever visited such places.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.040
Got it. I’ll check it out.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.320
Inspector Sing, are you investigating,

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.720
or interrogating witnesses?

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.560
You never call me in.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.280
Why would I?

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.120
My job

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.440
is to find the culprit.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.360
If all we do is hold meetings,

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.600
or kiss up to the boss,

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.320
the killer’s not gonna show up to get caught.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.880
I understand.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.800
So if I work for once,

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.320
you won’t interfere, right, Inspector Sing?

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.040
Khun Thamawat,

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.680
please come give your statement with me.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.000
King,

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.200
I just want to question
the only witness at the scene.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.400
No objection from you, Inspector Sing?

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.680
Because if you refuse to cooperate,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.320
I might have to reconsider
Khun Thamawat’s status,

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.760
that maybe he’s not just...

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.520
a witness anymore.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.320
I can go.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.160
Thup,

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.520
P'Singha.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.000
I’m fine.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.240
Either way,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.160
I have to cooperate with the investigation.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.400
Follow me.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.400
When you answered P'King this morning,

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.480
you meant it, right?

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.600
When have I ever lied?

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.000
Every word was true.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.480
Okay.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.240
Hey... you think,

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.720
P'King believes it?

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.400
That Thup really saw a ghost?

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.040
Or will he go after Thup like P'Singha did?

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.320
Doesn’t really concern us.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.200
Let the police handle it.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.200
So,

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.360
you’re not gonna ask me?

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.920
Where I’m sleeping tonight?

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.280
Nope.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.520
Got plans tonight.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.280
Yeah.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.400
I’m coming with you tonight.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.920
What’s with Inspector Sing?

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.360
Letting a murder suspect walk around free?

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.840
P'Sing did nothing wrong.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.640
I’m a witness, not a suspect.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.880
You called him “P’.”

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.880
You two that close?

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.880
But legally speaking, Khun Thamawat,

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.080
no witness is ever fully reliable,

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.440
not until the real culprit is caught.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.560
No matter how many times you ask,

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.160
I’ll give you the same answer.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.040
I didn’t do it.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.440
Hmm.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.040
Because actually,

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.280
I don’t intend to ask what
every other officer already did.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.760
They say you can see ghosts.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.280
Is that true?

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.600
You confirm you can see the unseen?

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.960
Things science can’t explain,

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.440
that’s why you got tangled up in this case.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.120
Yes.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.080
Sing doesn’t believe in any of that.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.200
So why did he keep you at his place?

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.400
Uh... well,

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.000
does that have anything to do with the case?

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.360
When I’m with P'Sing,

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.880
I don’t even know why,

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.600
I stop seeing those terrifying things.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.480
P'Sing always protects me from the spirits.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.120
And also...

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.360
from cops who just want a scapegoat.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.040
I know the police want to close the case fast,

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.760
but if that’s how it’s done, I’m not playing along.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.880
Do you know why Sing keeps you close?

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.040
So it’s easier to frame you later.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.080
Because you’re so obedient.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.920
Don’t you know Sing,

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.800
he’s done this before.
Someone died because of it.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.280
But I’m not denying
what you said, seeing the unseen.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.760
Because no matter how I look at it,

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.280
this case isn’t normal.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.080
If you ever have useful information,

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.680
you should come to me,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.560
not to Sing.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.800
Because if you trust
the wrong cop and end up dead,

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.080
don’t say I didn’t warn you.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.680
Inspector, that’s not right.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.800
Didn’t you read Thup’s autopsy file?

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.480
Nothing on his shirt links to the victim.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.600
No circumstantial evidence either.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.680
I read it.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.400
I just wanted to talk.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.960
Why?

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.880
Can’t I talk to him?

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.880
You’re the one keeping him at your place.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.240
Think no one knows?

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.920
How sure are you,
you won’t screw up again?

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.160
- Same place as always.
- Yeah.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.360
Tonight, man,

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.680
I’ve got plenty of good wine for you.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.040
Bay,

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.840
I’m not drinking much.
I’ve got work tomorrow.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.200
That’s Barolo wine.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.000
A famous one from Italy.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.880
It has a strong aroma,

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.600
maybe not ideal for beginners, though.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.720
Right.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.760
I’m not that good with wine anyway.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.600
Then let Buss take care of it for you.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.400
Bay,

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.240
you should start with a Merlot.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.280
This wine,

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.120
has a rich flavor,

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.680
and a soft fruity scent.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.120
Perfect for beginners,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.120
or maybe...

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.000
for getting to know someone new.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.240
Come on, I’ll take a picture for you.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.440
Smile, man.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.200
One, two, three.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.800
Hey,

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.520
I’m crashing here tonight.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.840
I’m drunk.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.960
Sey,

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.640
I don’t like this.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.960
Go take a shower first.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.280
You stink.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.400
I’m sleeping like this.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.680
Shouldn’t have gone there.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.320
Too crowded, too loud.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.199
Got a headache too.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.480
Then don’t go next time.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.239
Yeah.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.360
You still nag like always.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.040
You’re huge, you know.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.720
Thup,

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.080
What did King talk to you about?

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.200
Just questioning. That’s all.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.200
He talked about the case's odds.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.000
I insisted I didn't do it.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.600
Same as I told you.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.360
That's it.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.920
Don't you lie to me.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.520
What did that King say to you?

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.000
Inspector King said

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.480
Maybe...

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.120
Maybe you didn't want to protect me.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.520
But you kept me so you could pin the case.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.720
I saw the old transfer book.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.600
Did P'Singha cause a suspect to die?

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.280
Inspector King said

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.680
Maybe I'm next.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.600
Did you really do it?

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.480
Everything he said

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.680
was all true.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.920
I did kill someone.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.360
Stop, stop,why bring me here?

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.840
- Come.
- Let go. I'm not guilty.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.240
Sit.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.880
Sit.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.880
- Why bring me here?
- You'll find out if you're guilty.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.760
Whether you're guilty or not,

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.040
We'll deal with it in court.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.440
- Quiet.
- Help!

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.840
If you don't cooperate,

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.400
the holding room will become a cell.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.040
Let me out. Let me out.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.520
Shit.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.640
King.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.760
King.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.160
News spread nationwide
that I arrested the wrong suspect.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.960
So I was transferred.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.560
I must take responsibility for every mistake.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.480
As for that King,

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.320
he was promoted to central with his father.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.800
Even if it wasn't all my doing,

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.760
I caused an innocent person to die.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.480
If a cop like me dared to stand firm a bit more

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.200
and hadn’t followed that King,

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.080
that wouldn’t have happened.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.720
I’m not that good a cop, Thup.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.800
But still better

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.280
than that bastard King.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.280
To me,

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.200
P'Singha is already a good cop.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.760
If I were that good,

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.880
you wouldn’t doubt me.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.880
I’m sorry.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.360
I’m sorry for misunderstanding you.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.080
But I didn’t believe Inspector King’s words.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.000
I still came back to sleep at your house.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.600
’Cause my house isn’t haunted.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.280
Right?

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.080
Yeah.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.880
But I...

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.680
wanted to see for myself

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.520
what kind of cop you really are.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.840
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come back here.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.520
Believe me, P’.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.000
I wouldn’t risk my life.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.600
Can you stop making that face?

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.120
I feel guilty.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.080
I’m not making any face.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.120
Stop sulking.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.600
I’ve never begged anyone
except the Grandmaster Monk.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.680
Stop comparing me to a monk.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.080
I’m comparing you to the one I love most.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.920
Since the Grandmaster Monk passed away,

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.120
I only have you left.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.000
Take me in, please.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.000
Short-term or long-term, I don’t mind.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.200
Don’t cross the line.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.680
You stay only until the case is done.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.880
I know you’re

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.680
strong on the outside.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.160
Inside your heart

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.760
so soft.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.480
See? Soft.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.320
What the hell’s wrong with you?

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.360
Thanks for worrying about me.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.920
I’ve been a burden to you today.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.880
It’s my job anyway.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.560
Hello?

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.040
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.600
We are Ghost Hunt.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.720
Today we’re at the infamous Seven Corpses Tree.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.000
Let me tell you all, today,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.600
If I meet a ghost, I’ll ask right away

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.320
who the killer is.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.400
Shit.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.880
Man, you’re hopeless.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.040
Hey! Ghost! Come on out!

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.040
Someone’s here to test you.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.400
Bom, we’re a ghost-challenge channel, dude.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.160
If we want fame, the ghost better show up fast.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.280
Can’t stay with us otherwise.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.120
- Guys,
- Hey!

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.400
Hey, Dear!

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.320
Where did they hang themselves?

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.640
This one?

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.280
- These guys?
- Yeah.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.520
Shit.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.760
- Damn, it’s real.
- Hey, hey.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.760
- There’s fruit to eat too.
- Guys.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.520
They say this place

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.520
was built over an old graveyard.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.200
Right on top of it.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.600
This must be real for sure.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.440
Let’s go back.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.880
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.240
The fun’s just about to start.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.160
Hey, Bom.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.840
Want an orange? I’ll peel it.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.280
Eat it yourself.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.960
Whoa, look.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.800
All rotten.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.200
Stand up, guys.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.680
- What?
- I wanna shoot a thumbnail.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.920
Here.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.400
- Come.
- Yeah.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.200
I’ll use this shot for the thumbnail.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.240
Ready,one, two, three.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.360
Yeah.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.640
Hey, where’s the stuff?

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.880
Here.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.760
Hey.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.400
Did you hear footsteps?

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.800
Hey.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.280
This isn’t right.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.880
If you wanna livestream, do it in daylight.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.080
Ugh.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.000
If you’re scared, wait in the car.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.880
- Yeah.
- Views are spiking right now.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.640
I’m not going anywhere.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.680
You’ll see something real soon.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.200
Don’t chicken out. Come on, keep going.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.840
You sure about this?

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.480
Yeah, we’ve come this far.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.520
This method,

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.080
It’ll work for sure. I looked it up.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.040
Yeah.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.240
So, one incense stick is
for paying respect to the dead.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.160
But if you do this,

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.800
it’s to summon a spirit.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.680
Please, let me see a ghost just once.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.400
I’ll ask it myself who the killer is.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.680
Let me see it, please.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.480
Record this, record this.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.600
Shit, that’s a real crow sound.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.600
Rubber’s too soft.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.880
Stay here first.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.400
P'Singha.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.680
P'Singha, the car door’s locked.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.400
Why can’t I open it, P’?

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.080
What happened?

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.480
Another ghost?

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.280
Yes.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.640
But I’ve seen this one before.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.240
Where?

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.200
Clearly... it was,

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.160
in your office.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.080
If it’s followed me this far,

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.880
maybe it’s trying to warn us about something.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.520
If it wanted to warn you, it wouldn’t scare you.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.680
Let’s go.

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.520
Views are skyrocketing,
tens of thousands now.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.760
What should I do to thank the viewers?

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.280
If it hits...

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.760
thirty thousand,

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.600
I’ll climb the tree and call the ghost.

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.880
Yeah, do it!

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.240
- Should I?
- Yeah, go on!

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.920
- Let’s do it.
- Hurry up!

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.640
- For real?
- Yeah.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.520
What’s there to fear?
We’ve come this far.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.480
Hey, Jump, be careful.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.040
Relax, man.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.280
Alright.

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.000
Three, two, one.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.440
Hey!

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.160
That’s so cool.

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.480
See? Nothing happened.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.600
- Yeah.
- Totally chill.

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.000
What’s wrong with you?

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.680
Just seeing things,
stared at the screen too long.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.200
- Shit!
- Jump!

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.440
- Hey!
- What the hell’s wrong with you?

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.600
Jump, what’s wrong?

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:40.200
You called me, so I came to you.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.400
- Shit, I’m scared!
- Jump!

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.280
- Jump!
- Jump!

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.720
- Officers! I said stop!
- Don’t come near me!

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.320
- Hold him!
- Stay still!

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.000
- What’s happening?
- Hold him down!

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.920
- Calm down!
- I’m scared!

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.520
I said stop!

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.520
What’s happening?

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.560
Hey!

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.960
- He’s not making sense!
- We didn’t do anything.

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.600
- Nothing, sir!
- P’Jack!

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.480
Take him outside to calm down.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.880
I’m scared!

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.400
- Move it!
- I’m scared, don’t hurt me!

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.800
I’m really scared!

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.080
You’ve trespassed on a crime scene.

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.480
That’s against the law.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.720
How did you even get in here?

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.240
Show me your IDs.

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.640
Got any?

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.600
And stop filming right now.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.440
Give it here.

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.720
Turn it off. Now.

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.920
How did you get in here, huh?

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.120
Do you even know this is a crime scene?

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.960
God, these kids…

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.800
Thup. Thup.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.600
Thup.

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.800
Thup.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.480
Don’t be afraid.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.160
I’m right here.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.080
Tell me everything you saw last night.

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.560
- Saw a ghost?
- P’, you saw it too?

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.200
I think the ghost is following
orders more than anything.

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.880
There’s hair too , I’ll send it to the lab.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.800
Maybe the DNA matches a victim.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.280
You said those talismans and clay dolls

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.200
must belong to a spirit Shaman’s House
or a medium’s shrine, right?

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.200
What if it’s a meditation center that lures people in?

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.320
I’m glad I could help you, really.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.080
Two. One.

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.280
(Where have you been poking, little Thup?)

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.360
Shoot it.
(calm down, Inspector)

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.520
Don’t worry.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.840
I’m here now.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.400
So mushy.
(I want to watch them being sweet)

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.760
If she jumps,

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.360
we’ll let her jump alone.
(aren’t you going to help her?)

00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.960
Wake up, Otto.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.680
(Get back to work, Inspector)
Come on, straight to the cold room.
