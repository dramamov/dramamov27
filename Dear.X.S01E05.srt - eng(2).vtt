DEAR X

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.722
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.182
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.109
BUSAN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:16.576
Here comes actor Heo In-gang
on the red carpet.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.162
He will be presenting
the Best Actor Award tonight

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.247
at the Busan International
Film Festival.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.999
Please welcome him
with a big round of applause.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.650
Take my hand.

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:46.833
Baek Ah-jin is now walking in
gracefully with Heo In-gang's escort.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.085
As one of the most promising
next-generation stars

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.713
leading the future of Korean cinema

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:54.924
Baek Ah-jin captivates everyone
with poise and elegance

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.509
rarely seen in a rookie actor.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:02.891
The two are walking down the carpet
dazzling under the camera flashes.

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.268
Please give them a warm welcome.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.564
Hello, In-gang.

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:10.648
Hello.

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:15.361
You're the most coveted star in film
and advertising worldwide right now.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:18.740
Everyone in the country is curious
to see just how far

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.951
your fame and success will go.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.745
How does it feel?

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:28.875
It really sinks in
now that I'm here at the BIFF.

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:33.171
And here with superstar Heo In-gang
is Baek Ah-jin.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.007
Hello, I'm Baek Ah-jin.

00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:44.933
You must be nervous about being
on the red carpet for the first time.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:48.019
Yes, I was very nervous

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:53.358
but thanks to In-gang's
advice and guidance

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.901
I've relaxed a little.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.987
I think I'll be able
to enjoy the night

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.198
with a happy heart.

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.909
Then, you should stay
close by his side tonight.

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:05.787
But did you get permission from Lena?

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:11.125
Oh, Lena and I
are really close friends.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.587
And she's a generous person

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.673
so I'm sure she'll understand.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.788
Did I wake you?

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:50.415
Sorry.

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:52.959
I wanted to have a drink
with you tonight.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.380
You're the best.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.844
I told you to stop
coming to my place.

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.351
Then why didn't you change
the door code?

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.856
I know you don't mean it.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:23.990
Oh, right.

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.242
Is this the hand that Ah-jin held?

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.286
I'll disinfect it for you.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.121
Here we go.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.708
It was Mi-ri's favor.

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:41.924
You mean Baek Ah-jin's favor.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.093
Did you see the look in her eyes?

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:45.928
They're so creepy.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:50.350
She acts innocent, polite,
and sweet to everyone

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.560
but I get chills
when I look into her eyes.

00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:55.063
I can't tell
what emotions she's feeling.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.899
Lena, how much longer
do I have to wait?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.611
Wait for what?

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.156
About when I broke up with you?

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:07.283
You know I didn't mean that!

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:08.910
Why would you...

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.414
I've done this countless times.
Why won't you let it slide this time?

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.667
I thought I was being considerate
by waiting for you to accept it.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.297
But maybe my kindness
gave you false hope.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.216
Baby.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:34.560
Baby.

00:06:35.686 --> 00:06:37.605
Baby, I'm sorry.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:43.069
I'll be so lonely without you.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.738
Can you give me one more chance?

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.323
I'll try harder.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.618
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.589
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.051
Bye.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:09.554
Sleep tight.

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.648
Please help me.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:26.529
What's going on?

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:28.614
Cut! Lena!

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.491
Director.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:32.243
Her acting is completely off.

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:37.665
Hey, what's with that cheesy acting?

00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:39.417
Didn't you rehearse it?

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.252
I'm sorry.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:45.381
I wouldn't make that face
even if a cockroach were chasing me.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:48.176
She's right, Ah-jin.
This isn't a difficult scene.

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.053
Hyang-i, get me a bottle of water.
I'm thirsty.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.597
Just a moment.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.182
Hey.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:55.808
Go get it now.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.852
But Ah-jin might catch a cold.

00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.270
Now.

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:03.065
Okay.

00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:06.194
Let's take five.

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:08.362
Take three!

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.657
Help.

00:08:12.408 --> 00:08:13.409
Please help.

00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:15.244
Take five!

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:18.080
- Ready.
- Take ten!

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.127
Please help me.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.462
- Take 12!
- Take 15!

00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:26.339
- Take 20!
- Please help.

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.093
This is nuts.

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:38.017
Are you glaring at me now?
Your eyes could cut steel.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.728
Director, did you see
the look in her eyes?

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.481
How am I supposed to act
when she looks at me like that?

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:45.149
Lena!

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.735
Let's not make this harder, okay?

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.531
I can't get into character at all.

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:54.116
Can I just go home?

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:55.785
This is too much.

00:08:57.745 --> 00:08:59.497
I've never seen anyone like her.

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:03.876
You know why
she's acting like that, right?

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:08.923
I suggest you just apologize
and smooth it over.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:10.883
She's your senior, after all.

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:13.094
If we shut down this shoot today

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.846
we'll lose a fortune.

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:19.100
Please, I'm begging you.

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:21.269
I'm sorry, Director.

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:23.813
I'll do better.

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:28.401
We have zero chemistry.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.486
I can't get into the scene with her.

00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:37.702
Why does everyone act
like I'm doing it on purpose?

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.412
Why would I do that?

00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:46.544
BAEK AH-JIN REPLACES LENA
FOR JIN SOJU

00:09:46.627 --> 00:09:49.547
COSMETICS MARKET SLOWS,
YET THE BAEK AH-JIN EFFECT PERSISTS

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.631
A GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS?

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.179
Hey, In-gang, you're here.

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:01.851
Thanks for going
to the film festival with Ah-jin.

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:10.276
I helped you out,
so it's your turn now.

00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:11.527
What is it?

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:14.739
You must know, but I broke up
with Lena a long time ago.

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:18.868
She couldn't accept it
and needed time to process

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.536
but this can't go on.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.872
I need you to help end it.

00:10:23.497 --> 00:10:24.498
In-gang.

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:28.127
The Hadere deal is almost signed.

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:29.795
Just wait a little longer.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.673
Hadere requires
real couples as models.

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:35.009
No matter how much money's involved

00:10:35.092 --> 00:10:36.969
I don't want to lie to the public.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.389
I know how you feel.

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:42.183
I really do.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.978
But could you think about it
once more?

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.980
I've done everything you asked.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.233
But this time, I really can't.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:55.363
All right, then.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.531
I'm leaving.

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:00.534
Right.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:03.579
Look after Ah-jin
during next week's shoot.

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:06.082
She's new and doesn't know much yet.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:09.669
Treat her like family, okay?

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.338
Bye.

00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:22.598
Hey.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:25.017
Lena did what?

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:46.080
Do you think I'm a child?

00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:48.582
Don't try to calm me down
with cheap candy.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:52.086
Do you think
all I've got for you is candy?

00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:53.713
Drunk driving.

00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:56.090
Switching drivers afterward.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.885
If that comes out,
your career is over.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.186
Mi-ri!

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.479
Wait, I'm sorry.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.651
Thanks.

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:20.656
Mi-ri, I was wrong.

00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:22.950
Lena!

00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:26.203
Please think.

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:27.872
Okay?

00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:30.958
I knew she'd get what's coming.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.085
Even if it's Ms. Seo

00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:36.338
I still don't understand
how Lena acts that way.

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:38.299
There's always a reason.

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:40.801
Ms. Seo has been
in this industry for years.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:44.138
This won't be her first time
handling someone as arrogant as Lena.

00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:46.223
She prepares everything in advance.

00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:49.852
Mi-ri, you can't just
leave like that.

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:51.562
Prepare for what?

00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:54.648
I've heard about it.

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:57.902
She keeps a file that works
as shackles on every actor.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:00.696
Stuff that could ruin
not just their careers

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.199
but also their lives if revealed.

00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:06.368
You'd think it's a rumor

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:08.120
but when I look at Lena like that

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.830
- Mi-ri!
- it may not be a rumor.

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:11.582
Oh, jeez.

00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:12.917
Mi-ri, please.

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:15.336
- She really asked for it.
- Gosh.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:34.438
EPISODE 5: GRANT ME THE POWER
TO RISE TO THE TOP

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:05.928
Makeup looks great today.

00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:08.973
Your face did it all, Ah-jin.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.691
Oh, right.
We even go to the same salon.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.152
We have so much in common.

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.029
One would think
we were a package deal.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.823
You're even making me look bad.

00:14:27.157 --> 00:14:28.534
Get me something to drink.

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:31.829
While you're at it,
give us the room for five minutes.

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:33.414
Sure.

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:38.252
I wonder why you irritate me so much.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.629
Why do you think that is?

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.214
Well, I also wonder

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.633
why you absolutely despise me.

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:49.722
Rookie, you should be thinking
of a reason, not asking me.

00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:52.182
You should very well know

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:55.477
the film festival pairing was
Ms. Seo's decision.

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:56.770
It wasn't something I could refuse--

00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:59.106
And you wanted to refuse?

00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:01.108
No.

00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:04.069
I'd be a fool to refuse.

00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:06.447
I had no reason to turn it down.

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.576
It was such a good opportunity.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:14.371
Do you think you're untouchable
because Mi-ri is backing you?

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:19.376
Lena.

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:23.589
What dirt does she have on you
that makes you tremble like that?

00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:27.134
Hyang-i turned herself in
and said it was her fault.

00:15:27.217 --> 00:15:30.012
You're just here to give a statement,
so watch what you say.

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:31.138
Have a nice day.

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:36.060
I've been so curious
that I've lost sleep over this.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.730
Would you tell me, too?

00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:41.482
You.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:45.402
Don't ask me for reasons.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:46.654
Look for the reasons...

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.699
in yourself.

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:53.577
That's the only way
you won't be replaced next time.

00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:56.830
Ah-jin, are you heading out?

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:00.125
My manager's waiting downstairs.
See you.

00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:02.002
Bye.

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.678
That bitch.

00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:20.604
Delivery.

00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:39.850
If and when you become
more useful than you are now

00:17:39.933 --> 00:17:41.727
I might have a use for you.

00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:43.729
Then we could meet again.

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:54.531
Man.

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:04.374
I really missed you.

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:28.524
Hyang-i, you said
you used to be Lena's manager, right?

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:29.608
Yes.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.195
Is that why she mistreats you?

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.906
Who knows what's in her head?

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:38.408
I thought I did my best.

00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:39.910
Why do you ask?

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:42.788
Because you're my manager now.

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:46.416
Imagine how I'll feel
if anyone talks down to you.

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:50.462
Especially Lena.
She already hates me.

00:18:51.004 --> 00:18:53.423
Maybe that's why
she takes it out on you.

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:58.512
If she ever does that again,
make sure to tell me, okay?

00:18:58.595 --> 00:18:59.638
Don't worry.

00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:02.057
Remember the shackle file
I mentioned last time?

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:05.644
I asked around, and they said
Ms. Seo keeps it in her desk drawer.

00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:07.521
If things go south,
we can just take that.

00:19:15.696 --> 00:19:16.697
Hyang-i.

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:21.660
We're the same age.
Why do you keep using the honorifics?

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.622
You can drop it when it's just us.

00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:27.958
You sure?

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:42.014
YOON SEOK-HA'S FIRST BOOK SIGNING

00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:43.390
CO-OFFENDER Y

00:19:43.473 --> 00:19:44.975
A JOURNEY THROUGH STORIES
WITH AUTHOR YOON SEOK-HA

00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:47.102
NUMBER 1 BESTSELLER FOR 7 WEEKS

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.937
WINNER OF THE 2021
LITERARY SQUARE NOVEL AWARD

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:20.969
Get out right now!

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:22.262
How dare you come here?

00:20:23.263 --> 00:20:24.514
Father.

00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:27.726
Do you think I'd come here
if I had any other choice?

00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:29.186
Don't "Father" me!

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:32.773
I warned you not to jump
into a business you can't handle.

00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:34.733
Now you took out loan-shark money?

00:20:34.816 --> 00:20:36.568
Are you out of your mind?

00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:38.946
Would I be here
if I were in my right mind?

00:20:39.821 --> 00:20:40.822
Father.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.200
I feel like I'm going to die.

00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:46.828
People shouldn't have to die
over money.

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:49.373
Help me out this once--

00:20:49.456 --> 00:20:50.874
You think I don't know you?

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:52.626
Get out
if you're here to spew nonsense.

00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:54.294
I can't stand the sight of you.

00:20:57.631 --> 00:21:01.969
Then I'll go to Jun-seo and beg him.
Is that what you want?

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.179
What did you say?

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:06.890
How dare you--

00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:09.726
It's not like you can take
that money with you when you die!

00:21:12.187 --> 00:21:14.147
Let's be honest.

00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:17.109
I'm his mother.
I have the right to ask him for this.

00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:20.362
I raised your precious grandson
with these hands!

00:21:20.862 --> 00:21:23.740
I raised the child that you dote on

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:26.994
but you won't spare a single penny
for the daughter-in-law?

00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:28.787
Does that make sense?

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:32.374
Soo-hyuk, get her out now.

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:33.625
Ma'am, let's go.

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.168
I'm not going anywhere.

00:21:35.252 --> 00:21:36.253
- Calm down.
- Get off me.

00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:38.380
- This way.
- You can't do this to me.

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:40.173
You'll be punished for this!

00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:41.842
Let go of me!

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:43.510
Father!

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:58.191
How long has she been coming here?

00:21:58.483 --> 00:21:59.901
It's none of your concern.

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:01.987
Is this all the books you brought?

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.741
This won't even cover
a fraction of my contacts.

00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:07.951
Next time, bring a whole bundle.

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.544
NAMYEONG BANK

00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:23.884
I gave you my account number.

00:22:24.593 --> 00:22:26.553
Do you have to show up at the house?

00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:29.348
You know your uncle will flip
if he finds out.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.141
- Auntie, I just--
- Sure.

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:34.770
I get that you want to help
your little brother.

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:36.229
I won't stop you from doing that.

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:38.482
But put yourself in his shoes.

00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:43.278
Who would want to see a brother
who killed their own dad?

00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:49.576
Why do you have to make me
say these things?

00:22:55.707 --> 00:22:58.001
I get it, so don't worry.

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:01.505
I'll transfer the money next time.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.601
Auntie.

00:23:15.852 --> 00:23:18.230
You'll keep sending me
Jae-hun's photos, right?

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.275
I heard he's doing
great in school, unlike me.

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:26.363
If he wins any awards
or gets good grades, send them to me.

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:30.784
Thank you

00:23:32.035 --> 00:23:33.161
for not abandoning him

00:23:34.204 --> 00:23:35.288
and raising him well.

00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:39.292
And I'm sorry.

00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:41.753
I'll spend the rest of my life

00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:44.548
making it up to you.

00:23:48.885 --> 00:23:51.346
So, don't cry over being harsh to me.

00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:53.890
Just be happy.

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:56.101
Okay?

00:24:41.938 --> 00:24:43.106
Auntie, I'm home.

00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:01.958
Hello, please take
good care of In-gang.

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:03.877
- Thank you.
- Grab some snacks.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.004
Isn't he amazing?
Please take good care of him.

00:25:06.087 --> 00:25:07.172
- Thanks for the snacks.
- Sure.

00:25:07.255 --> 00:25:08.882
- Help yourselves.
- Thank you.

00:25:08.965 --> 00:25:10.091
Hi!

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:13.553
Have some coffee.

00:25:13.637 --> 00:25:16.431
- It's on me today.
- Thank you so much.

00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:19.434
You know the publishing industry
has been rough these days.

00:25:19.935 --> 00:25:22.521
But your book is bucking the trend.

00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:25.607
We'll need aggressive promo
to keep the momentum

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.317
and we'll need your help.

00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:29.694
I'll do whatever I can to help.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.071
Great.

00:25:31.154 --> 00:25:33.406
I'll green-light
the booking requests, then.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:34.491
Sure.

00:25:34.574 --> 00:25:36.535
We're moving in one minute.

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:37.869
Get ready, everyone.

00:25:38.286 --> 00:25:40.956
It's gotten busy here
with that drama shoot.

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:43.833
You must come here often
to have picked this place.

00:25:43.917 --> 00:25:45.085
Sorry for the hassle.

00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:47.045
No, I picked it on purpose.

00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:48.421
I wanted to take a look.

00:25:49.005 --> 00:25:52.050
Oh, is it for your next book?

00:25:52.133 --> 00:25:56.471
Then the TV promo will help
with your writing.

00:25:57.138 --> 00:25:58.473
I think so.

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.475
- Shall we head out?
- Yes.

00:26:13.613 --> 00:26:16.157
Sorry, did I keep you waiting?

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:17.242
No, it's fine.

00:26:18.285 --> 00:26:19.953
- Director, I'm here.
- Was traffic bad?

00:26:20.036 --> 00:26:21.329
Parking took forever.

00:26:21.788 --> 00:26:23.123
Did you wait long?

00:26:26.293 --> 00:26:27.294
Look.

00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:28.920
We need to talk.

00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:32.716
Let's talk outside.

00:26:38.054 --> 00:26:39.055
Cut!

00:26:40.015 --> 00:26:41.016
One more time.

00:26:42.642 --> 00:26:44.060
- Gather up!
- Everyone, gather!

00:26:45.478 --> 00:26:46.646
Quickly!

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.649
That was great,
but we need more movement.

00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:10.962
Jun-seo.

00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:21.514
I finally tracked you down

00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:25.644
and you're still clinging to Ah-jin,
who treats you less than a rat?

00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:27.979
You're pathetic!

00:27:31.274 --> 00:27:32.275
"Still"?

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.780
So, there was something
between him and Baek Ah-jin before?

00:27:38.573 --> 00:27:39.574
Get off me.

00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:42.202
When did you get back?

00:27:42.285 --> 00:27:44.454
When you get back,
you call your mother first.

00:27:44.537 --> 00:27:46.331
Do I have to find out
from your advertisement?

00:27:46.414 --> 00:27:48.708
Why is it so hard
to see my own son's face?

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:52.837
Did you keep your promise to me?

00:27:54.214 --> 00:27:55.215
What promise?

00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:57.634
To apologize to Ah-jin.

00:27:58.009 --> 00:28:00.970
How long are you going to pretend
nothing happened?

00:28:01.721 --> 00:28:03.973
She ended up miserable,
all because of you.

00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:06.976
I can barely stand

00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:09.562
to look at you.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:22.951
Lena.

00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:24.869
What are you doing here?

00:28:25.161 --> 00:28:26.496
Introduce me to this author.

00:28:27.747 --> 00:28:28.748
Sorry?

00:28:28.832 --> 00:28:32.752
I'll post on Instagram and everywhere
that I loved his book.

00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:34.254
I don't care
if it's on TV or the radio.

00:28:34.337 --> 00:28:37.424
We can tell them to make a segment
like "Meet the Author."

00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:40.218
Why the sudden interest?

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.429
My soju deal is gone

00:28:42.512 --> 00:28:44.556
so I can hand back
the "Korea's Little Sister" title.

00:28:46.516 --> 00:28:49.352
I think it's time to rebrand
as sophisticated and intellectual.

00:28:50.437 --> 00:28:51.855
So, are you doing it or not?

00:28:53.148 --> 00:28:54.149
This is your job.

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.569
I'll make some calls now.

00:29:00.488 --> 00:29:02.282
I am Ah-jin's mother.

00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:04.617
You still need to call ahead--

00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:07.245
What mother calls ahead?

00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:10.165
- You can't just barge in--
- Quiet.

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:12.917
- Where's the CEO's office?
- What?

00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:14.252
Ah-jin's mother?

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.383
As far as I know,
her mother passed away.

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:23.511
I guess she hasn't told you.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.056
I was her stepmother,
but I raised her with love.

00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:31.186
I fed her well
and gave her a good bed

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:32.645
as if she were my own child.

00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:33.980
Yes, I heard.

00:29:35.398 --> 00:29:37.942
You lovingly raised her
and threw her out.

00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:39.027
She said that?

00:29:39.527 --> 00:29:41.112
She left on her own.

00:29:42.572 --> 00:29:43.573
Why are you here?

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:46.284
Keep her off TV.

00:29:47.744 --> 00:29:48.912
Let me live.

00:29:49.204 --> 00:29:50.914
You know that's impossible.

00:29:51.206 --> 00:29:52.415
What do you really want?

00:29:54.709 --> 00:29:55.794
Money?

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:04.135
I have money.

00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:09.140
Hello.

00:30:09.224 --> 00:30:10.433
Ah-jin.

00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:12.018
Your mother is here.

00:30:12.101 --> 00:30:13.770
Her, an actress?

00:30:15.188 --> 00:30:16.189
Don't make me laugh.

00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:20.443
She's not the type to wear
nice clothes and soak up applause.

00:30:20.527 --> 00:30:23.112
She's lowborn by nature.

00:30:23.196 --> 00:30:25.031
An alcoholic for a mother

00:30:25.114 --> 00:30:27.200
and a criminal for a father.

00:30:27.283 --> 00:30:28.910
What more do you need to know?

00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:30.703
Excuse me?

00:30:31.204 --> 00:30:34.833
Do you know how her father died?

00:30:36.918 --> 00:30:38.211
He was killed.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.631
Someone else served time,
but I know the truth.

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:45.718
Ah-jin did it.

00:30:49.138 --> 00:30:52.016
Just thinking about it
makes my heart race

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:53.560
and terrifies me.

00:30:54.394 --> 00:30:57.188
And now, she's on TV everywhere

00:30:57.272 --> 00:30:59.440
so I'm too scared

00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:01.568
to even breathe.

00:31:06.155 --> 00:31:10.326
It's best you stay away
from that bitch.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.370
Ignore me if you want

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:16.791
but you'll see what I mean
once she devours you.

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:20.712
Most people only get it
after she's taken an arm

00:31:21.462 --> 00:31:24.632
because of how cunning she is.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.141
Long time no see.

00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:34.809
How have you been?

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:35.894
Great, thanks to you.

00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:39.439
Since you beat me everywhere
but the face to put me on camera.

00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:40.565
Why are you here?

00:31:40.648 --> 00:31:41.941
I'm not here to see you.

00:31:42.817 --> 00:31:44.485
I came so I won't have to see you
ever again.

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:50.283
I hope you get my drift.

00:31:50.825 --> 00:31:52.410
Let's not meet again.

00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:04.130
Sorry about that.
That must have been unpleasant.

00:32:05.131 --> 00:32:07.508
It wasn't fun, but I'm used to it.

00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:10.303
It's also my job
to handle these things.

00:32:10.386 --> 00:32:13.514
And it's the reason
you need to earn well.

00:32:15.391 --> 00:32:16.809
I understand.

00:32:17.977 --> 00:32:20.855
I'll climb steadily
so this doesn't happen again.

00:32:28.738 --> 00:32:31.032
What kind of life have you lived?

00:32:31.741 --> 00:32:34.243
Even your own mother
isn't on your side.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.334
Your past must be fascinating.

00:32:42.168 --> 00:32:43.336
I'm dying to know.

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.756
If you keep this up

00:32:47.382 --> 00:32:50.426
you'll only end up more upset.

00:32:55.014 --> 00:32:57.308
- Are you worried for me?
- Yes.

00:32:58.851 --> 00:33:02.605
Because I want you to keep working
in this field for a long time.

00:33:03.272 --> 00:33:04.691
Worry about yourself.

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:08.403
I'm busy figuring out
what'll finally make me feel better.

00:33:11.406 --> 00:33:12.407
Look forward to it.

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:27.922
SPECIAL GUESTS
AUTHOR YOON SEOK-HA, ACTRESS LENA

00:33:31.426 --> 00:33:32.635
Hey, Lena.

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:36.055
This is the author
you'll be appearing with. Say hi.

00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:40.935
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.271
You're really handsome for an author.

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:45.064
Thank you.

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:47.275
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:49.360
Or you had one?

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:51.779
Someone you can't get over?

00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:56.492
I'm joking.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.828
Do you want to grab dinner after?

00:33:59.454 --> 00:34:01.706
No, thank you.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.712
We'll bring you both in together
in five minutes.

00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:13.843
CO-OFFENDER Y

00:34:13.926 --> 00:34:15.928
"'Let me find the highest place.

00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:19.390
Let every moment become a chance

00:34:20.266 --> 00:34:21.559
to paint myself.

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:26.898
And let my finished portrait hang

00:34:28.107 --> 00:34:29.984
at the very top of the world.'

00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:32.862
This was her prayer

00:34:33.529 --> 00:34:36.032
and I prayed it wouldn't be answered.

00:34:37.992 --> 00:34:39.952
I prayed that the child
I failed to save

00:34:40.787 --> 00:34:42.914
somehow escaped the savagery

00:34:44.123 --> 00:34:47.293
and now rests in quiet days."

00:34:47.627 --> 00:34:50.254
Okay, I got it.

00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:52.173
Ah-jin, you must be hungry.

00:34:53.132 --> 00:34:55.760
- Who was that on the phone?
- The agency.

00:34:55.843 --> 00:34:57.428
There will be
a building inspection today.

00:34:57.512 --> 00:35:00.098
Power's out from six o'clock,
so everyone's heading home early.

00:35:00.848 --> 00:35:02.183
Great work, everyone.

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:03.893
- Great work.
- Thank you.

00:35:03.976 --> 00:35:06.187
You two were fantastic.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.981
- The live reactions were amazing.
- That's great.

00:35:09.065 --> 00:35:10.066
- See you next time.
- Yes.

00:35:10.149 --> 00:35:11.526
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:14.946
If dinner's a no, do you like drinks?

00:35:17.365 --> 00:35:18.366
- Hong-sik.
- Yes?

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:21.160
He's taking me home tonight,
so you can clock out first.

00:35:21.244 --> 00:35:22.245
Okay.

00:35:23.996 --> 00:35:24.997
I can't drive.

00:35:25.706 --> 00:35:27.041
Be my chauffeur.

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:29.418
Are you bored, or just naturally--

00:35:29.502 --> 00:35:30.586
Naturally a psycho?

00:35:31.337 --> 00:35:32.547
Think whatever you want.

00:35:34.173 --> 00:35:35.633
I'll wait on the first floor.

00:35:45.393 --> 00:35:46.394
Hyang-i.

00:35:47.436 --> 00:35:48.437
You must be tired.

00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:53.860
Don't you have to take the car back
to the office after you drop me off?

00:35:55.194 --> 00:35:56.362
You know what?

00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:59.991
Just let me off there,
then go straight home.

00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:02.535
It's fine. I'm okay.

00:36:03.077 --> 00:36:07.373
And if I drop you off at the office,
how will you get home?

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:09.834
That's what taxis are for.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.212
You said everyone left early, anyway.

00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:15.673
You should go home and get some rest.

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:17.592
Should I?

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.438
HYANG-I

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:36.861
I'LL TELL HER
THE BUILDING WILL BE UNDER INSPECTION

00:36:38.237 --> 00:36:39.238
Actually

00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:41.741
I should swing by the office.

00:36:42.825 --> 00:36:45.244
I left something really important.

00:36:45.328 --> 00:36:46.537
Mind if I go grab it?

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.540
I'm scared someone might take it.

00:37:16.776 --> 00:37:19.862
Power's out from six o'clock,
so everyone's heading home early.

00:37:41.884 --> 00:37:43.010
Wait here.

00:37:43.636 --> 00:37:44.887
I'll be right back.

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:46.801
Looking for this?

00:39:48.844 --> 00:39:49.970
BAEK AH-JIN MATERIALS

00:39:51.847 --> 00:39:53.057
KANG LENA MATERIALS

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.350
Or this one?

00:39:57.686 --> 00:39:59.397
Wow, you're sweating.

00:40:00.439 --> 00:40:02.108
Did you walk all the way up here?

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:05.194
The central elevator runs
even in emergencies.

00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:06.695
I guess you didn't know.

00:40:07.321 --> 00:40:10.908
Anyway, thanks to that,
I beat you here.

00:40:11.617 --> 00:40:13.202
Now, they're both in my hands.

00:40:28.134 --> 00:40:29.135
Lena.

00:40:29.677 --> 00:40:30.678
Lena!

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:35.891
You.

00:40:39.145 --> 00:40:40.896
Were you going to use these
to bring me down?

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:46.777
Hate to break it to you,
but you're the one who's screwed now.

00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:49.822
Should we see
who really gets screwed?

00:40:57.705 --> 00:40:59.039
Get on your knees and beg.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.041
"Lena

00:41:02.543 --> 00:41:03.544
spare me.

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:06.797
I'm sorry."

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:09.884
Do it.

00:41:10.259 --> 00:41:12.511
Easy, right?
It costs no money or effort

00:41:12.595 --> 00:41:14.054
as long as you swallow your pride.

00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:23.022
I guess you're not desperate yet.

00:41:24.482 --> 00:41:26.150
You want to keep your pride?

00:41:26.233 --> 00:41:27.318
Then, how about this?

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:41.665
No wonder In-gang is fed up with you.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.792
This fucking bitch.

00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:45.586
What did you say?

00:41:47.796 --> 00:41:48.797
This psycho.

00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:21.330
Let's go.

00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:19.263
No need to be alarmed.

00:43:20.472 --> 00:43:22.766
It was just a senior giving
an arrogant junior a lesson.

00:43:23.475 --> 00:43:24.643
You call that a lesson?

00:43:25.144 --> 00:43:26.729
Are you a Baek Ah-jin fan?

00:43:26.812 --> 00:43:28.606
You seem oddly concerned.

00:43:29.398 --> 00:43:33.527
Even if I weren't,
it wasn't normal behavior.

00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:35.362
It sounds like you know her.

00:43:36.488 --> 00:43:38.616
Do you know how insane she is?

00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:41.702
She screwed me over
every chance she got.

00:43:42.578 --> 00:43:43.787
But today

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:45.831
I won.

00:43:56.258 --> 00:43:57.760
Are you sure you won?

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:00.012
You bet.

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:01.847
I feel great.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.145
What are you doing on Christmas Eve?

00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:12.816
It's our agency's anniversary.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.276
Come with me.

00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:16.111
Why should I?

00:44:16.195 --> 00:44:18.947
Actually, my ex is going.

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:22.076
I want to make him jealous
and win him back.

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:23.661
Help me out.

00:44:26.538 --> 00:44:28.165
And Ah-jin will be there.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.432
CO-OFFENDER Y

00:44:59.822 --> 00:45:03.033
I like being in the spotlight.

00:45:03.617 --> 00:45:06.537
But I also love observing people.

00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:13.168
Using and sharing emotions
is very fascinating.

00:45:13.252 --> 00:45:15.504
And I think I have a gift for it.

00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:19.216
What do I treasure most? Myself.

00:45:19.925 --> 00:45:25.848
I want to be a chameleon-like actress
who can turn into any color.

00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:53.000
Hello.

00:45:54.376 --> 00:45:55.377
- Ms. Seo!
- Hi!

00:45:55.461 --> 00:45:56.962
- Hello.
- Congrats.

00:45:57.045 --> 00:45:58.756
Thank you for coming.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.300
We will now begin

00:46:01.383 --> 00:46:05.220
Longstar Entertainment's
Seventh Founding Anniversary

00:46:05.304 --> 00:46:09.224
and the 2021 Year-End Party.

00:46:12.144 --> 00:46:17.483
First, greetings
from CEO Seo Mi-ri and our guests.

00:46:18.192 --> 00:46:20.486
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:21.653
Thank you.

00:46:21.737 --> 00:46:24.198
- Thank you very much.
- Congratulations.

00:46:24.281 --> 00:46:26.366
- Congratulations.
- I appreciate it.

00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:28.118
Thank you.

00:46:32.331 --> 00:46:35.417
Hello, I'm Seo Mi-ri,
the CEO of Longstar Entertainment.

00:46:35.501 --> 00:46:37.211
The year's already over.

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:38.295
Looking back

00:46:39.755 --> 00:46:41.507
every single moment...

00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:08.867
You take this without water?

00:47:35.811 --> 00:47:39.940
Thank you for hanging in there
so well this year.

00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:44.236
To everyone who's here...

00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:58.292
Ah-jin.

00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:10.053
Did you get home safely that day?

00:48:10.137 --> 00:48:11.847
It was a bit of discipline
from senior to junior

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.515
so don't take it personally.

00:48:13.765 --> 00:48:15.684
Don't worry, Lena.

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:19.396
Say hi.

00:48:19.479 --> 00:48:22.316
He's the hottest name
in publishing now.

00:48:22.399 --> 00:48:23.400
This is Yoon Seok-ha.

00:48:25.611 --> 00:48:27.487
Come on. Say hello.

00:48:30.282 --> 00:48:31.283
Hello.

00:48:31.992 --> 00:48:33.327
I'm Yoon Seok-ha.

00:48:34.161 --> 00:48:36.914
And this is my junior actress,
Baek Ah-jin.

00:48:37.789 --> 00:48:38.790
Nice to meet you.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.336
This isn't your first meeting, right?

00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:49.384
You saw each other last time.

00:48:51.136 --> 00:48:52.137
In the parking lot.

00:48:58.685 --> 00:48:59.770
Thanks for earlier.

00:49:10.906 --> 00:49:14.117
Next up is a video reel

00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:18.163
featuring seven years of Longstar's
growth through joys and sorrows.

00:49:18.246 --> 00:49:19.748
Let's watch it together.

00:50:04.376 --> 00:50:08.296
You're ignoring me.
If you had basic human decency

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.548
you wouldn't.

00:50:10.257 --> 00:50:12.426
What else do you want me to do?

00:50:13.093 --> 00:50:15.053
I told you I had no choice.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.061
Lena.

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:24.688
Lena!

00:50:28.442 --> 00:50:30.068
Should we see
who really gets screwed?

00:50:32.988 --> 00:50:34.072
Get on your knees and beg.

00:50:47.002 --> 00:50:48.211
Turn it off.

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.559
It was so realistic
that I almost thought it was real.

00:51:02.642 --> 00:51:03.727
You must be startled.

00:51:04.394 --> 00:51:07.481
This is how dedicated our actors are.

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:09.691
Please give them a big hand!

00:51:32.172 --> 00:51:33.882
- Hyang-i.
- Yes?

00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:35.926
What about after you get off work?

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:37.803
Will you report to Lena?

00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:44.226
That shackle file in Ms. Seo's desk.

00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:46.144
Did Lena ask you to tell me about it?

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.688
Ah-jin, how did you--

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:51.316
Exactly which parts
did she tell you to say?

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:53.860
I swear I didn't want to.

00:51:54.986 --> 00:51:57.197
I honestly didn't want to do it.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.909
But she loaned us money when my dad
had stomach cancer surgery

00:52:01.827 --> 00:52:04.454
and threatened me to pay it back.

00:52:04.538 --> 00:52:08.125
So, I'm supposed to go through
Ms. Seo's desk to find the file?

00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:10.043
That's what she wants, right?

00:52:12.587 --> 00:52:14.131
I'm on your side.

00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:16.550
You know I'm nothing like her.

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:19.761
If you're really sorry

00:52:21.012 --> 00:52:22.264
you start helping me now.

00:52:22.848 --> 00:52:25.308
I fell into her trap

00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:28.019
and you moved the way she told you.

00:52:45.745 --> 00:52:47.164
Wasn't it fun?

00:52:48.748 --> 00:52:49.833
I thought it was.

00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:55.338
What?

00:52:56.464 --> 00:53:00.135
"Superstar Lena Gets Caught
Assaulting a Rookie."

00:53:00.218 --> 00:53:01.344
That can be the title.

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:03.555
If this video gets out

00:53:03.805 --> 00:53:05.515
the public will go wild.

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:10.437
Massive reputation damage,
commercial penalty fees

00:53:10.812 --> 00:53:14.608
a lifetime of hate,
mockery, and insults...

00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:19.196
- What else?
- Hey.

00:53:29.664 --> 00:53:30.790
If you don't want that

00:53:31.541 --> 00:53:33.418
how about you kneel and beg?

00:53:35.587 --> 00:53:36.588
Get on your knees and beg.

00:53:37.297 --> 00:53:38.548
"Lena."

00:53:38.632 --> 00:53:39.758
"Ah-jin

00:53:40.508 --> 00:53:41.676
I'm sorry."

00:53:41.927 --> 00:53:43.053
"Spare me."

00:53:43.136 --> 00:53:44.346
"Spare me."

00:53:46.097 --> 00:53:47.098
Say it.

00:53:49.184 --> 00:53:50.560
You said it was easy.

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:52.270
It costs no money or effort.

00:53:52.354 --> 00:53:54.272
Easy, right?
It costs no money or effort

00:53:54.564 --> 00:53:56.066
as long as you swallow your pride.

00:53:56.149 --> 00:53:58.109
As long as you swallow your pride.

00:53:59.527 --> 00:54:00.528
Listen.

00:54:05.492 --> 00:54:06.952
You should see the look on your face.

00:54:10.956 --> 00:54:13.291
I'm kidding, Lena.

00:54:13.792 --> 00:54:17.087
As long as you don't bother me

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:20.173
I've got no reason
to post that video.

00:54:23.843 --> 00:54:27.180
Let's get along from here on out.

00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:42.946
Would you like one?

00:54:53.415 --> 00:54:55.166
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

00:54:57.711 --> 00:55:00.005
I always repay what I'm given.

00:55:00.505 --> 00:55:03.425
I've been wondering
how to pay you back.

00:55:04.592 --> 00:55:07.095
And look where you are.
Perfect to get knocked off.

00:55:08.013 --> 00:55:09.306
Ms. Baek Ah-jin.

00:55:09.723 --> 00:55:13.018
I'll do everything
to convict you of this murder.

00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:19.107
Plenty of people here would love
to know your little secret.

00:55:21.609 --> 00:55:22.610
Get out.

00:55:22.694 --> 00:55:25.363
Have you checked in
on Choi Jung-ho lately?

00:55:32.287 --> 00:55:35.415
You already forgot? He's the guy

00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:37.167
whose life you fucked up.

00:55:37.459 --> 00:55:40.086
A baseball bat to your dad's head.

00:55:55.727 --> 00:55:56.728
Ah-jin.

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.774
We need to wrap up. Come over here.

00:56:55.995 --> 00:56:57.455
NEWSHOUND HEE-KOOK
CHECK THIS PERSON OUT

00:57:02.961 --> 00:57:03.962
Hey, Hee-kook.

00:57:04.587 --> 00:57:07.674
Baek Ah-jin looks like she got caught
and is being blackmailed.

00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:09.259
Look into it.

00:57:12.053 --> 00:57:13.680
Yes, she seemed to know the guy.

00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:20.186
I'd like to thank Ms. Seo,
who believed in me

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:24.149
and to our agency family
as well as the senior actors.

00:57:24.732 --> 00:57:26.609
I'll work even harder.

00:57:26.693 --> 00:57:30.196
To Longstar Entertainment's
boundless growth!

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.781
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:54.424
It's cold.

00:59:57.552 --> 00:59:59.053
I'll get you something warm.

01:00:13.234 --> 01:00:17.071
CO-OFFENDER Y

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:29.459
My misfortune

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.629
turned into your commodity.

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:34.464
I PRAYED THAT THE CHILD I FAILED
TO SAVE SOMEHOW ESCAPED THE SAVAGERY

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:56.402
You really missed me, didn't you?

01:01:04.577 --> 01:01:05.578
It hurt...

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:09.248
a lot.

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.421
Of course, it did.

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:19.550
It also hurt me a lot.

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:24.681
I thought you'd be at ease by now.

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:29.227
I've always suffered.

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.732
I thought I had escaped

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:37.902
but I was always in the same place.

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:44.200
I'm sick of it.

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:00.425
Jun-seo.

01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:03.094
Help me.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:10.143
I want to learn to love him.

01:02:12.019 --> 01:02:13.020
Heo In-gang.

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:51.100
DEAR X

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.575
