WEBVTT

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:07.445
The bees are flying

00:00:08.363 --> 00:00:10.824
Wild roses are blooming

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.577
Around the pond

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:17.539
‎The wild roses are blooming

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:19.082
-How are you feeling?
-Huh?

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:20.875
Since the fever.

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:24.003
Not feeling sick?

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:27.799
Not at all. Thanks for asking.

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:30.093
Shiki accidentally took

00:00:32.178 --> 00:00:34.055
an E-capsule.

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:40.979
What?

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.189
Where did you store it?

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:44.732
On the top shelf above the sink.

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:49.153
My ex-wife couldn't reach there
because she was short.

00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:53.950
So, I just kept it there.

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:59.247
It seems Shiki ran out of cold medicine

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.457
and mistook the capsules for it.

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:04.794
Just a bit of a hero, Just…

00:01:04.878 --> 00:01:07.463
It wasn't like

00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:09.215
I could make her throw it up afterward.

00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:14.053
You don't have to look at me like that.

00:01:14.137 --> 00:01:15.471
So, you had a wife?

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:17.557
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:21.519
Anyway, about the E-capsule…

00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:25.106
We should probably report it…

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:28.860
to the boss, right?

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:32.238
We just got scolded last time.

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:34.324
He didn't have to get that angry, right?

00:01:34.824 --> 00:01:35.950
ONLINE NEWS

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:36.951
CLOSE CALL AT THE FESTIVAL!

00:01:37.035 --> 00:01:37.994
WHO ARE THE THREE HEROES
WHO PREDICTED THE EXPLOSION?

00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:41.247
The rule of Nonamare is…

00:01:42.457 --> 00:01:44.417
Our identities must never be revealed!

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.378
Technically, they didn't, right?

00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:48.338
Ohsuke!

00:01:48.838 --> 00:01:52.091
Maybe not this time.

00:01:53.218 --> 00:01:58.139
But a moment's carelessness
could cause disaster.

00:01:59.057 --> 00:01:59.933
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:01.434
Um…

00:02:02.268 --> 00:02:03.144
May I ask a question?

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:04.145
Go ahead.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.358
I understand why we hide our powers,

00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:12.528
but helping people isn't wrong, is it?

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:15.740
You are only "just a bit" of a hero.

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:19.244
Your powers aren't great enough
to make you true heroes.

00:02:19.327 --> 00:02:23.206
You're just slightly
above ordinary humans.

00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:26.459
Those few fragile hairs on your head

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:31.256
can make you think you're a mighty hero
once people start praising you!

00:02:32.507 --> 00:02:34.926
Craving fame

00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:37.553
leads only to ruin.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.766
Sometimes, even if
someone takes an E-capsule,

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.143
it doesn't activate their ability.

00:02:44.686 --> 00:02:47.981
Maybe just wait and see.
If nothing happens, then that's that.

00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:49.190
-True.
-Right?

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:53.194
Noticed anything strange lately?

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:55.238
Strange?

00:02:55.947 --> 00:02:57.907
Like a change in your body

00:02:58.616 --> 00:03:00.785
or being able to do something
you couldn't before.

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:03.579
There is.

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:06.666
A sixth sense.

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:08.626
A sixth sense?

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.419
KOBAYASHI LAUNDRY

00:03:09.502 --> 00:03:11.587
I feel like someone is there.

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:16.467
Like someone's always watching me.

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:19.303
I can sense spirits.

00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:21.681
Cursed ones too.

00:03:23.683 --> 00:03:25.810
That's what you saw
on TV last night, right?

00:03:25.893 --> 00:03:26.602
PARANORMAL TV SHOW

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:33.484
Yes, you're right.

00:03:37.322 --> 00:03:39.324
If, for example,

00:03:40.158 --> 00:03:41.826
you could become an Esper…

00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:45.330
Like have psychic powers?

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:46.289
Yeah.

00:03:47.582 --> 00:03:49.125
What kind of power would you want?

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.922
Maybe the power to erase stains instantly.

00:03:56.883 --> 00:03:59.302
-From shirts… Like laundry stains.
-Right.

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:02.221
Cleaning!

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:07.935
Concentrate.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.772
-Huh?
-Believe the stain will vanish.

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:11.689
Concentrate.

00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:13.024
From your heart.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:24.994
Right. Concentrate.

00:04:27.038 --> 00:04:28.081
Concentrate more.

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:33.127
No way that would work.

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:39.217
Why'd you get soy sauce on it anyway?

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:41.928
I'll bleach it… myself.

00:04:42.678 --> 00:04:45.515
Anything unusual lately?

00:04:48.142 --> 00:04:49.268
Unusual?

00:04:52.647 --> 00:04:54.273
Nothing so far.

00:04:56.109 --> 00:04:57.235
"So far"?

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:02.323
Is something bothering you?

00:05:04.075 --> 00:05:05.368
The schedule's gone off track.

00:05:06.744 --> 00:05:08.454
We were supposed to reach a point

00:05:08.538 --> 00:05:10.373
through repeated missions.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.792
The schedule is delayed.

00:05:14.335 --> 00:05:17.839
An unidentified factor.

00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:20.258
Something is interfering.

00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:23.302
At this rate, we won't make it in time.

00:05:25.638 --> 00:05:29.225
We may need more missions ahead.

00:05:29.308 --> 00:05:30.435
Can I count on you?

00:05:31.352 --> 00:05:32.770
I'm relying on you, Bunta.

00:05:34.814 --> 00:05:35.648
Of course.

00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:38.067
I've realized

00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:39.819
the meaning of this work.

00:05:41.028 --> 00:05:43.906
Saving others in secret

00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:46.409
is another way of saving yourself.

00:05:47.618 --> 00:05:49.745
Isn't that it?

00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:52.999
Excellent.

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:56.836
You're developing a sense of leadership.

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:57.795
Leadership?

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.007
You have what it takes to lead.

00:06:02.008 --> 00:06:03.593
Guide the others.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.847
Yes, sir!

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.351
Last month,
the waste sorting procedure changed.

00:06:12.435 --> 00:06:14.896
-Please choose someone from your group
-Okay.

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.397
-to take charge.
-I will.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.692
I'd like to thoroughly implement
the procedure.

00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:20.985
-Is that fine?
-Press that…

00:06:21.068 --> 00:06:22.528
Anyone want to take charge?

00:06:26.824 --> 00:06:29.076
-Should I do it?
-Is it okay?

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.162
-Yeah!
-Please do!

00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:32.413
‎No…

00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:36.083
-Naito, I'll make fresh tea.
-Okay…

00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:38.252
Excuse me.

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:47.303
I hate to bring this up,

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:52.183
but the other night,
in the next town's park,

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:53.976
you were with a homeless man, right?

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:59.106
I know you used to live like that,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.275
but things are different now, right?

00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:03.444
I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

00:07:27.677 --> 00:07:29.470
You look like
a completely different person.

00:07:29.554 --> 00:07:31.013
That's the mission, isn't it?

00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:38.271
Mission 92.

00:07:38.354 --> 00:07:39.981
Catch the bouquet.

00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:43.442
Mission 93.

00:07:43.526 --> 00:07:45.027
Refill the copier paper!

00:07:45.653 --> 00:07:46.988
Mission 94.

00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:48.781
Drain the bathwater!

00:07:49.532 --> 00:07:50.950
Mission 95.

00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:53.661
Swap the plain sheets for floral ones!

00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:01.294
Mission 100.

00:08:01.377 --> 00:08:03.337
Make her eat the carrot!

00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:04.005
‎PROUD OF ITS SWEETNESS

00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:07.508
Man, I just want to save more people!

00:08:08.134 --> 00:08:09.510
You're fired up.

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:10.428
Hanzo,

00:08:11.053 --> 00:08:13.347
that's what being a hero is about.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.309
You've changed.

00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:19.979
Guess I've developed self-awareness.

00:08:23.441 --> 00:08:24.859
Look! Thirty-eight degrees!

00:08:26.652 --> 00:08:28.404
With one hand!

00:08:28.487 --> 00:08:33.117
Once I learned to focus power
in my fingertips, it worked.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.785
You're evolving.

00:08:34.869 --> 00:08:38.164
Maybe your power is electromagnetic waves?

00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:40.249
What do you mean?

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:42.668
A microwave
is an electromagnetic wave, right?

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.838
But emitting electromagnetic waves
from your hand…

00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:48.758
Even if it's just a bit, that's amazing!

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.301
Electromagnetic waves?

00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:52.511
I've been training too.

00:08:53.012 --> 00:08:55.348
I can ask birds for a favor now.

00:08:56.015 --> 00:08:56.932
Next are bugs.

00:08:57.016 --> 00:08:58.559
The smaller the brain, the harder it is.

00:08:58.643 --> 00:08:59.518
Bugs?

00:08:59.602 --> 00:09:00.686
I'm testing pill bugs now.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.064
I said no, Sasuke!

00:09:03.606 --> 00:09:06.359
The cheese is good, right?
So, please, can you listen to me?

00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:08.903
The fancy cheese you had before is better?

00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:10.946
But it costs more than my meal.

00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:14.033
Fine, I'll buy it then.

00:09:14.116 --> 00:09:16.369
-You can eat that first.
-You can understand them?

00:09:16.452 --> 00:09:17.828
They talk?

00:09:17.912 --> 00:09:22.625
Not in words, but more like their beliefs.
It might be their feelings.

00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:24.919
-You should train too, Bunta.
-No.

00:09:25.544 --> 00:09:28.339
I can only hear through touch.

00:09:28.422 --> 00:09:31.425
You can hear anywhere you touch?
How about toes?

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:32.843
Hold on.

00:09:32.927 --> 00:09:35.054
-Try it!
-What do you mean?

00:09:35.137 --> 00:09:36.013
-Yes, here.
-Now?

00:09:36.097 --> 00:09:37.473
-Here!
-Okay.

00:09:37.556 --> 00:09:39.392
-You mean Hanzo's toes?
-Yeah.

00:09:39.475 --> 00:09:40.768
-Huh?
-Okay.

00:09:41.352 --> 00:09:42.853
-No way!
-Come on!

00:09:42.937 --> 00:09:45.189
Guess what I'm thinking!

00:09:45.773 --> 00:09:46.982
I'll do it, then.

00:09:53.823 --> 00:09:55.783
-A little louder.
-Try higher up.

00:10:03.374 --> 00:10:05.418
This looks kind of indecent.

00:10:05.501 --> 00:10:06.627
Quiet!

00:10:08.963 --> 00:10:09.797
I want okonomiyaki.

00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:11.966
-Got it!
-What did he say?

00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:13.551
He's a traitor!

00:10:15.302 --> 00:10:18.723
I wonder if you can hear it clearer
if it's closer to the head.

00:10:19.223 --> 00:10:21.183
What about your own inner voice?

00:10:21.267 --> 00:10:22.852
Why would I want to hear that?

00:10:22.935 --> 00:10:25.104
Maybe there is a voice you haven't heard.

00:10:26.939 --> 00:10:29.734
Still no power from Shiki?

00:10:31.068 --> 00:10:32.361
She says she's got a sixth sense.

00:10:32.445 --> 00:10:33.529
Sixth sense?

00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:35.072
She can see ghosts?

00:10:35.156 --> 00:10:36.490
Is that even a psychic power?

00:10:36.574 --> 00:10:38.951
She said she feels like
someone's watching her.

00:10:39.034 --> 00:10:41.078
Maybe it's a stalker?

00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:43.372
She's cute, after all.

00:10:53.215 --> 00:10:55.551
Sorry. We're closed.

00:10:58.053 --> 00:10:58.971
Closed…

00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:04.268
Wait.

00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:06.771
What are you looking for?

00:11:07.772 --> 00:11:11.150
Girls in my class said
this shop has flowers

00:11:11.734 --> 00:11:14.361
you can't find anywhere else.

00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:16.530
So, I thought I'd buy some.

00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:20.451
-For your girlfriend?
-I don't have one.

00:11:20.534 --> 00:11:23.245
It's for my mom.
Her wedding anniversary is coming up.

00:11:29.543 --> 00:11:32.630
What kind of flowers does she like?

00:11:33.714 --> 00:11:35.174
Not sure.

00:11:36.717 --> 00:11:37.760
What about you?

00:11:38.636 --> 00:11:40.054
Which ones here do you like?

00:11:52.816 --> 00:11:54.318
Ohsuke's late.

00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:56.820
He said there was a plant delivery today.

00:11:56.904 --> 00:11:59.198
Flower shops take online orders now, huh.

00:12:01.367 --> 00:12:03.536
-I'm home!
-Welcome back.

00:12:03.619 --> 00:12:04.662
TAKOYAKI TAKKOPI

00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:06.622
Why okonomiyaki?

00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:08.499
-Ask this guy.
-He's the traitor.

00:12:08.582 --> 00:12:09.917
I like takoyaki too!

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.460
Of all days…

00:12:12.044 --> 00:12:14.004
Please come in.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.971
This is a customer
from the dry-cleaning shop.

00:12:22.054 --> 00:12:24.098
Nice to meet you. I'm Ichimatsu.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.976
I love takoyaki!

00:12:28.352 --> 00:12:30.020
-Love!
-Takoyaki!

00:12:30.104 --> 00:12:31.939
Yeah!

00:12:32.022 --> 00:12:33.774
-Love!
-What is that?

00:12:33.857 --> 00:12:36.110
-What is that?
-Love!

00:12:36.193 --> 00:12:36.694
‎What?

00:12:36.777 --> 00:12:37.736
-Love!
-Huh?

00:13:01.802 --> 00:13:03.596
Takoyaki Research Club?

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:05.222
-Yes.
-Didn't know that existed.

00:13:05.306 --> 00:13:08.851
-Oh.
-I found it in a customer's laundry.

00:13:08.934 --> 00:13:12.730
-I told him we used to be a takoyaki shop.
-Yeah.

00:13:12.813 --> 00:13:13.647
Yes.

00:13:13.731 --> 00:13:16.317
So, I asked,
"Was the shop called Takoppi?"

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.568
-And she said, "Yes."
-Yeah.

00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:19.194
Sorry, it's okonomiyaki today.

00:13:19.278 --> 00:13:20.779
No, it's great.

00:13:20.863 --> 00:13:22.615
-Close enough, right?
-Yes.

00:13:23.657 --> 00:13:24.700
-Do you want more?
-Yes.

00:13:24.783 --> 00:13:25.993
-Oh?
-Please.

00:13:26.076 --> 00:13:27.411
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

00:13:27.494 --> 00:13:30.080
Nice to see someone young.

00:13:30.164 --> 00:13:31.165
You have a great appetite.

00:13:31.248 --> 00:13:33.042
-I'll put mayo on for you.
-I love it.

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:34.043
Here.

00:13:34.543 --> 00:13:36.879
So, what do you do
in the Takoyaki Research Club?

00:13:36.962 --> 00:13:41.008
Make takoyaki and eat it
or go out to eat it,

00:13:41.091 --> 00:13:42.593
then make more, then go out to eat it.

00:13:43.469 --> 00:13:44.720
Study, kid.

00:13:45.888 --> 00:13:47.931
-Is your university nearby?
-Yes.

00:13:48.015 --> 00:13:48.932
Tokyo Institute of Technology.

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:51.769
-Huh?
-You're smart!

00:13:51.852 --> 00:13:53.729
-Wow.
-Not really. I repeated a year.

00:13:53.812 --> 00:13:56.106
-Even though…
-Wow!

00:13:57.483 --> 00:13:58.984
Where'd you go to college, Bunta?

00:13:59.068 --> 00:14:00.819
Don't ask that now.

00:14:01.654 --> 00:14:02.488
So,

00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:04.615
how do you all know each other?

00:14:07.076 --> 00:14:09.912
Besides me,
they all work at the same company.

00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:13.707
We're kind of like handymen
who do all sorts of odd jobs, you know?

00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:16.752
Do you do things
like stand in line for people?

00:14:16.835 --> 00:14:17.920
-Yes, we do that too.
-Oh,

00:14:18.003 --> 00:14:20.214
maybe I'll hire you sometime.

00:14:20.297 --> 00:14:22.841
Do you have a website?

00:14:23.842 --> 00:14:27.471
It's not an amount
a student can afford though.

00:14:28.472 --> 00:14:29.306
We're handymen,

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.851
but not your average handymen.

00:14:32.935 --> 00:14:34.937
We work with higher ideals.

00:14:36.105 --> 00:14:36.939
We're

00:14:37.523 --> 00:14:40.693
inspired by the greatness

00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:41.860
of that ideal.

00:14:43.654 --> 00:14:46.573
What ideal is that?

00:14:50.285 --> 00:14:51.704
World peace?

00:14:53.288 --> 00:14:55.374
Wow!

00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:56.792
Amazing!

00:14:58.711 --> 00:15:00.754
Bunty's my husband.

00:15:07.136 --> 00:15:09.221
I'll go get the takoyaki sauce.

00:15:09.304 --> 00:15:10.556
Oh, sorry.

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:12.433
She's cute and a great person,

00:15:12.516 --> 00:15:14.268
-but why?
-Why?

00:15:14.893 --> 00:15:16.020
Yes?

00:15:18.439 --> 00:15:19.565
Why…

00:15:20.441 --> 00:15:22.943
is takoyaki sauce so good, huh?

00:15:26.238 --> 00:15:27.531
-Okay.
-Yes.

00:15:27.614 --> 00:15:29.324
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

00:15:29.408 --> 00:15:30.659
Alright.

00:15:31.285 --> 00:15:32.828
-Okay.
-Thank you.

00:15:33.328 --> 00:15:34.747
-Ichimatsu.
-Yes?

00:15:35.497 --> 00:15:37.124
You're still young,

00:15:37.708 --> 00:15:39.251
with a bright future ahead.

00:15:40.169 --> 00:15:43.756
Stay away from old folks like us.

00:15:44.715 --> 00:15:47.634
Yeah, but you're not that old.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.305
Shiki may look young,
but she's actually pretty up there.

00:15:52.723 --> 00:15:55.184
I don't care about age at all.

00:15:56.101 --> 00:15:57.352
Oh, really?

00:15:58.604 --> 00:15:59.980
Young folks these days.

00:16:00.064 --> 00:16:01.774
Really…

00:16:09.114 --> 00:16:10.407
I'm home!

00:16:14.328 --> 00:16:16.455
You're so late!

00:16:16.538 --> 00:16:17.748
I stopped by somewhere.

00:16:17.831 --> 00:16:18.957
Where?

00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:20.834
Why do you care?

00:16:20.918 --> 00:16:23.796
Just because your dad's on a business trip
doesn't mean you can go wild.

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:25.214
Ow!

00:16:25.297 --> 00:16:26.799
Today's dinner is hamburger steak.

00:16:31.011 --> 00:16:32.638
We're a normal family, right?

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.515
What?

00:16:34.598 --> 00:16:36.141
I'm taking a bath first.

00:16:41.188 --> 00:16:42.648
Normal's fine, isn't it?

00:16:47.611 --> 00:16:49.863
GRADUATION CEREMONY

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.497
Well then.

00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:00.415
Um…

00:17:03.585 --> 00:17:05.170
You're the guy from the festival, right?

00:17:07.673 --> 00:17:08.799
You saved us.

00:17:08.882 --> 00:17:10.926
With the yakisoba griddle!

00:17:11.927 --> 00:17:13.345
-Oh, that.
-That…

00:17:13.428 --> 00:17:15.639
That thing's super heavy, isn't it?

00:17:17.766 --> 00:17:21.228
I've been doing hard labor for years.

00:17:21.728 --> 00:17:23.522
That's awesome!

00:17:24.273 --> 00:17:26.108
Mind if I touch your arm?

00:17:27.818 --> 00:17:29.236
Whoa. It's big.

00:17:33.282 --> 00:17:34.366
Alright.

00:17:48.463 --> 00:17:49.464
About earlier…

00:17:50.174 --> 00:17:51.842
Sorry for saying such a rude thing.

00:17:53.969 --> 00:17:56.346
About you being old.

00:17:57.431 --> 00:18:00.976
I'm older than you,

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.270
so that was out of line.

00:18:04.813 --> 00:18:05.856
Bunty.

00:18:06.523 --> 00:18:07.357
Yes?

00:18:08.317 --> 00:18:09.860
You were jealous, weren't you?

00:18:12.654 --> 00:18:14.656
That's why you said that, right?

00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:17.993
No, I was just worried.

00:18:19.536 --> 00:18:20.370
Worried?

00:18:20.454 --> 00:18:24.124
What if he's a stalker?

00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:26.710
He said he's from
Tokyo Institute of Technology,

00:18:27.252 --> 00:18:29.713
but he didn't even look that smart.

00:18:30.464 --> 00:18:31.882
See? You are jealous.

00:18:31.965 --> 00:18:34.092
It's not like that.

00:18:34.176 --> 00:18:38.472
He's just a chick barely growing feathers.
No need to get jealous.

00:18:39.056 --> 00:18:42.434
I have a mission to save everyone.

00:18:42.517 --> 00:18:45.479
Yeah. World peace, right?

00:18:46.605 --> 00:18:47.606
World peace.

00:18:48.982 --> 00:18:52.069
World peace.

00:18:58.659 --> 00:19:00.494
-Hey, Ichimatsu.
-Hey.

00:19:10.879 --> 00:19:15.550
Recent applied studies
on competitively inhibiting DHPS

00:19:15.634 --> 00:19:19.346
have focused on mechanisms that resemble
the structure and behavior of compounds

00:19:19.429 --> 00:19:20.430
like p-aminobenzoic acid…

00:19:30.899 --> 00:19:32.943
He really is a student here.

00:19:34.069 --> 00:19:35.529
I'm still suspicious.

00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:39.658
TAKOYAKI RESEARCH CLUB

00:19:39.741 --> 00:19:40.951
I just dropped by,

00:19:41.034 --> 00:19:42.452
since I had some work nearby.

00:19:42.536 --> 00:19:45.998
But has Ichimatsu been
in the Takoyaki Research Club for a while?

00:19:46.081 --> 00:19:48.750
No, he suddenly joined last month.

00:19:48.834 --> 00:19:51.253
He's a repeat junior,
so he should be busy though.

00:19:51.336 --> 00:19:54.172
We're triple repeaters,
and we don't have any free time either.

00:19:54.256 --> 00:19:57.467
-But we can't help it. It's love.
-Takoyaki…

00:19:57.551 --> 00:19:59.636
-Love!
-Love!

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.721
Together?

00:20:00.804 --> 00:20:02.556
-Love!
-Love…

00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:07.519
-It's him.
-Maybe so.

00:20:11.148 --> 00:20:12.232
Yup.

00:20:15.068 --> 00:20:16.486
Excuse me.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.449
I'm a friend of Ichimatsu,
who lives in his neighborhood.

00:20:21.033 --> 00:20:22.534
Just between us,

00:20:22.617 --> 00:20:26.038
my daughter's actually crazy about him.

00:20:26.121 --> 00:20:26.872
‎-Huh?
‎-Yeah.

00:20:26.955 --> 00:20:29.833
Could you tell me

00:20:29.916 --> 00:20:32.502
what type of girls he likes?

00:20:32.586 --> 00:20:34.087
His type?

00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:35.839
What do you think?

00:20:36.423 --> 00:20:39.634
I don't know.

00:20:39.718 --> 00:20:42.054
But if Ichimatsu's type
really is the neighbor's daughter

00:20:42.137 --> 00:20:44.890
and I say he likes the opposite type,

00:20:44.973 --> 00:20:47.184
she might think, "Oh, I'm not his type.

00:20:47.267 --> 00:20:48.393
I'll just give up."

00:20:48.477 --> 00:20:51.813
If that happened,
I'd feel awful for Ichimatsu.

00:20:51.897 --> 00:20:52.939
That's long.

00:20:53.023 --> 00:20:54.608
So, the best answer is…

00:20:55.525 --> 00:20:58.487
He probably likes all kinds of girls!

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.448
That makes him sound shallow, doesn't it?

00:21:01.531 --> 00:21:02.991
Oh, right.

00:21:04.034 --> 00:21:06.995
You tend to overthink, don't you?

00:21:07.704 --> 00:21:09.081
I get that a lot.

00:21:12.584 --> 00:21:13.752
Ichimatsu's type?

00:21:13.835 --> 00:21:16.546
Yeah. What type of girls does he like?

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.756
The cute type?

00:21:21.385 --> 00:21:23.720
-Watch out.
-Sorry.

00:21:24.346 --> 00:21:26.765
He's in a long-distance relationship,
I think.

00:21:26.848 --> 00:21:28.558
Not sure though.

00:21:29.226 --> 00:21:31.520
I heard he's in
a long-distance relationship.

00:21:31.603 --> 00:21:33.021
Oh, right.

00:21:33.105 --> 00:21:34.648
Is there an age-gap?

00:21:35.273 --> 00:21:38.151
-I think it's a high school classmate.
-Oh, really?

00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:40.862
-So cute!
-Right?

00:21:41.363 --> 00:21:43.698
Wait, there are others…

00:21:46.243 --> 00:21:47.744
He seems like an ordinary student.

00:21:52.999 --> 00:21:54.543
‎-Right.
‎-True.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.631
Thank you for waiting.

00:21:59.714 --> 00:22:01.383
-Thank you.
-Okay.

00:22:01.466 --> 00:22:03.009
Looks delicious.

00:22:03.969 --> 00:22:05.595
Sorry to drag you out on your day off,

00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:07.848
especially when there's no mission.

00:22:07.931 --> 00:22:08.807
No problem.

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.017
We help each other out.

00:22:12.519 --> 00:22:16.314
But we're unstoppable.

00:22:16.398 --> 00:22:19.359
We can infiltrate
anywhere now, mission-style.

00:22:19.443 --> 00:22:21.236
I was just watching.

00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:22.988
No.

00:22:25.532 --> 00:22:30.287
But I didn't think
you cared so much about Shiki.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.624
If a coworker, well, not technically,

00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:40.505
but someone you live with
might have a stalker,

00:22:40.589 --> 00:22:42.257
of course, you'd worry.

00:22:44.759 --> 00:22:45.719
True.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.016
No one knows
how long this setup will last.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.106
You're only pretending

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.025
to be her husband

00:23:00.108 --> 00:23:02.694
because her memory's confused.
It wouldn't be a surprise

00:23:02.777 --> 00:23:04.571
if it ends anytime.

00:23:06.114 --> 00:23:09.743
When it does, you'll just move out.

00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:12.829
It's all part of the arrangement.

00:23:16.082 --> 00:23:18.251
Don't call it that.

00:23:19.711 --> 00:23:25.008
Because she really believes
I'm her husband.

00:23:26.343 --> 00:23:28.386
I've heard her thoughts over and over.

00:23:28.929 --> 00:23:30.680
If someone else moved in,

00:23:31.223 --> 00:23:33.642
she'd believe that person
is her husband next.

00:23:34.392 --> 00:23:35.435
For real.

00:23:39.314 --> 00:23:42.484
Would it really be that easy?

00:23:43.735 --> 00:23:47.864
You can't even explain
how you got accepted, right?

00:23:47.948 --> 00:23:49.491
How and why it happened.

00:23:52.452 --> 00:23:53.453
You know,

00:23:54.037 --> 00:23:55.622
I took an E-Capsule

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.750
and started communicating with animals.

00:23:59.584 --> 00:24:01.920
It's something
that can't really be explained.

00:24:03.004 --> 00:24:06.549
Normally, it shouldn't be possible,
but I can do it.

00:24:07.676 --> 00:24:10.136
Nothing surprises me anymore.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.973
Otherwise,
you wouldn't survive in Nonamare.

00:24:17.644 --> 00:24:19.688
Non Amare.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.733
You must not love.

00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:25.402
I…

00:24:26.111 --> 00:24:28.154
love Sasuke and the animals.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.409
Don't tell the boss.

00:24:34.786 --> 00:24:36.413
I love this job too.

00:24:37.706 --> 00:24:38.957
And the team.

00:24:42.919 --> 00:24:44.296
Love, huh?

00:24:46.673 --> 00:24:48.425
This is a lesson I learned.

00:24:49.092 --> 00:24:51.386
You have to treasure what's precious

00:24:52.304 --> 00:24:54.973
before you lose it.

00:24:58.935 --> 00:25:00.437
I love you too, Bunta.

00:25:04.482 --> 00:25:05.525
You know, Hanzo,

00:25:06.443 --> 00:25:08.069
maybe you are popular?

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.946
What's that supposed to mean?

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:11.906
Now, it just made my heart flutter!

-Excuse me.
-Welcome.

00:25:50.403 --> 00:25:51.821
Is Shiki here?

00:25:53.073 --> 00:25:54.115
Bunty?

00:25:55.617 --> 00:25:56.826
You're Bunty, right?

00:25:57.577 --> 00:25:58.953
-Well…
-Hey!

00:25:59.037 --> 00:26:01.748
Bunty came!

00:26:01.831 --> 00:26:04.125
-Um…
-Bunty? Which Bunty?

00:26:06.753 --> 00:26:07.921
Bunty?

00:26:09.798 --> 00:26:11.383
It's Bunty!

00:26:11.466 --> 00:26:12.592
Hello.

00:26:12.675 --> 00:26:14.135
I wanted to meet you.

00:26:14.219 --> 00:26:16.679
Don't make your wife cry again!

00:26:16.763 --> 00:26:17.889
Sorry.

00:26:18.723 --> 00:26:20.141
I was just passing by.

00:26:20.225 --> 00:26:21.851
It's her birthday, after all.

00:26:23.228 --> 00:26:24.062
Back from work?

00:26:25.271 --> 00:26:26.481
-What?
-Back from work?

00:26:26.564 --> 00:26:28.108
No, I mean…

00:26:28.608 --> 00:26:30.318
Birthday?

00:26:30.402 --> 00:26:31.694
Yeah, her birthday's today.

00:26:32.278 --> 00:26:34.614
So, you came to pick her up.

00:26:35.782 --> 00:26:38.368
Today is her birthday?

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:45.166
Really bad!

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.587
A present…

00:26:50.213 --> 00:26:51.131
What should I get her?

00:26:51.965 --> 00:26:52.799
Jewelry?

00:26:52.882 --> 00:26:53.883
No.

00:26:53.967 --> 00:26:56.010
Better to go safe. Something practical.

00:26:58.805 --> 00:27:00.557
That won't beat a pickling stone.

00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:09.357
It doesn't have to be better.

00:27:09.983 --> 00:27:11.860
Why am I trying to compete?

00:27:12.569 --> 00:27:15.238
A couple's gift?
What kind of gift is that?

00:27:15.321 --> 00:27:18.950
We used to pretend
we didn't notice each other's birthdays.

00:27:19.451 --> 00:27:21.202
How can I top a pickling stone?

00:27:21.286 --> 00:27:22.787
Compared to a pickling stone,

00:27:22.871 --> 00:27:24.038
what counts as winning?

00:27:24.122 --> 00:27:26.458
What counts as losing? I don't even know.

00:27:27.459 --> 00:27:28.835
I guess jewelry.

00:27:28.918 --> 00:27:33.214
Plain, simple, and a bit expensive.
It's the safe choice.

00:27:34.215 --> 00:27:37.135
Safe? Would that make her happy?

00:27:37.719 --> 00:27:39.596
I want her to be happy.

00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:41.347
I want to make her smile.

00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:45.143
What would make her happy…
What would make her happy?

00:27:55.653 --> 00:27:57.071
‎KOBAYASHI LAUNDRY

00:28:07.332 --> 00:28:08.291
Bunty!

00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:10.210
Say something!

00:28:19.719 --> 00:28:20.929
What's wrong?

00:28:24.557 --> 00:28:26.643
Happy birthday.

00:28:28.895 --> 00:28:30.688
I wanted to give you something,

00:28:32.315 --> 00:28:33.399
but I had no idea.

00:28:35.193 --> 00:28:36.819
I didn't know what made you happy.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.155
I didn't know what you liked.

00:28:40.198 --> 00:28:41.491
I didn't know.

00:28:42.575 --> 00:28:43.827
So, I couldn't buy anything.

00:28:46.579 --> 00:28:49.290
No, not that I don't know,

00:28:50.333 --> 00:28:51.918
but realizing how much I don't…

00:28:52.627 --> 00:28:54.879
I don't know…

00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:02.136
Sorry!

00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:04.806
I'm sorry!

00:29:13.606 --> 00:29:17.026
I don't really know you either.

00:29:19.153 --> 00:29:21.114
Your past jobs,

00:29:22.073 --> 00:29:23.616
memories of your dad…

00:29:25.493 --> 00:29:29.455
I also didn't know you could get
so competitive over little things.

00:29:32.208 --> 00:29:33.418
Sorry, I'm petty.

00:29:34.836 --> 00:29:36.796
That's just who you are.

00:29:37.589 --> 00:29:41.175
Even panicking over a gift…

00:29:41.259 --> 00:29:43.052
That's you too.

00:29:45.513 --> 00:29:48.391
Even that pickling stone made me happy.

00:29:52.937 --> 00:29:56.316
Isn't this where you hug me back?

00:29:57.942 --> 00:30:01.237
Am I not loved?

00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:16.419
Bunty?

00:30:19.005 --> 00:30:19.923
Yeah?

00:30:21.174 --> 00:30:22.175
My birthday.

00:30:25.803 --> 00:30:27.096
It's tomorrow.

00:30:38.107 --> 00:30:38.942
Who was that?

00:30:55.166 --> 00:30:56.250
Damn it!

00:31:06.094 --> 00:31:09.389
He chased me down. That was close.

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:17.313
I told you, I got away.

00:31:21.317 --> 00:31:23.778
You worry too much, Ai-chan.

00:31:26.239 --> 00:31:28.950
It's great you get to do whatever.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.456
I found him.

00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:38.167
I'm going to meet him.

00:31:38.668 --> 00:31:40.461
The name's Kujou.

00:31:41.337 --> 00:31:42.171
Mr. Kujou.

00:31:48.386 --> 00:31:49.595
Sorry, I'll call you back.

00:32:00.523 --> 00:32:01.691
It's open.

00:32:04.944 --> 00:32:06.487
Pill bugs?

00:32:08.614 --> 00:32:10.408
-What?
-Don't scream!

00:32:10.992 --> 00:32:11.951
-Hey!
-What the…

00:32:12.035 --> 00:32:13.077
Ow!

00:32:13.161 --> 00:32:14.495
Wait!

00:32:14.579 --> 00:32:16.456
-What's going on?!
-Don't "what's going on" me!

00:32:16.539 --> 00:32:18.291
You've been stalking my wife!

00:32:19.876 --> 00:32:23.463
You thought you lost me, huh?
You're too soft!

00:32:23.546 --> 00:32:24.714
You rookie chick!

00:32:24.797 --> 00:32:28.259
Stop tailing girls
and focus on your studies!

00:32:33.264 --> 00:32:34.307
Yes.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:35.308
I'm sorry.

00:32:37.518 --> 00:32:39.437
Don't ever go near her again.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.355
He thinks I'm stalking Shiki.

00:32:42.523 --> 00:32:43.775
I'll go along with it.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.986
You're…

00:32:48.154 --> 00:32:49.447
not a stalker, are you?

00:32:51.949 --> 00:32:53.159
No…

00:32:53.242 --> 00:32:54.160
What are you after?

00:33:00.708 --> 00:33:03.586
I'm sorry! The truth is…

00:33:04.921 --> 00:33:06.255
It's this…

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.427
Psychic Power Research Club.

00:33:11.511 --> 00:33:12.512
Please take me…

00:33:14.055 --> 00:33:14.972
as your disciple!

00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:25.483
Here.

00:33:28.778 --> 00:33:30.905
Mind if I stop by again?

00:33:32.448 --> 00:33:33.449
Anytime.

00:33:34.325 --> 00:33:35.159
Okay then.

00:33:37.912 --> 00:33:38.913
Shion.

00:33:42.625 --> 00:33:45.378
That flower's name is Shion.

00:33:47.547 --> 00:33:49.006
Oh, really.

00:33:51.092 --> 00:33:53.761
I saw him make a morning glory bloom.

00:33:53.845 --> 00:33:56.973
I smelled takoyaki,
so I looked in from outside.

00:33:57.056 --> 00:34:00.309
Then I saw a man gently stroke
the morning glory vines,

00:34:00.393 --> 00:34:02.186
and then they bloomed.

00:34:04.981 --> 00:34:07.984
Hanzo, you can control animals, right?

00:34:09.443 --> 00:34:11.237
And you, Bunty. What's your power?

00:34:15.283 --> 00:34:18.161
Please, give me psychic powers too!

00:34:18.661 --> 00:34:20.079
"Give me"?

00:34:20.872 --> 00:34:21.747
All right.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:23.875
I'll grant them.

00:34:24.542 --> 00:34:28.004
But in return, you must tell no one.

00:34:28.087 --> 00:34:33.259
Not even your long-distance girlfriend
from high school.

00:34:33.342 --> 00:34:34.510
-How did you know?
-First,

00:34:35.887 --> 00:34:38.264
do 100 sit-ups every day!

00:34:40.516 --> 00:34:41.893
All of us train daily.

00:34:42.476 --> 00:34:46.272
We do 100 sit-ups, 50 push-ups,

00:34:46.355 --> 00:34:48.065
and 30 minutes of wall-sitting.

00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:51.652
That's how we build our strength
and mastered our skills!

00:34:52.361 --> 00:34:54.030
-Skills…
-There's no easy pill

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.492
that gives you powers instantly!

00:34:59.368 --> 00:35:01.579
Only blood, sweat, and tears!

00:35:02.163 --> 00:35:03.039
Yes.

00:35:08.419 --> 00:35:09.253
Do your best.

00:35:10.046 --> 00:35:10.880
I'll do my best!

00:35:11.464 --> 00:35:13.549
-Begin 100 sit-ups!
-Yes!

00:35:15.718 --> 00:35:17.595
One, two…

00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:21.182
What do we tell the boss?

00:35:22.892 --> 00:35:23.809
Hanzo.

00:35:26.354 --> 00:35:27.438
Let's keep this between us.

00:35:28.773 --> 00:35:29.857
In any company,

00:35:30.441 --> 00:35:33.236
there are things better left unreported.

00:35:34.237 --> 00:35:37.949
The boss wouldn't want to fire all of us.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.911
We contained the problem before it spread.

00:35:43.037 --> 00:35:45.081
With that determination, he won't talk.

00:35:45.164 --> 00:35:46.457
Really?

00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:54.882
Thanks.
I'll buy some fancy cheese for you guys.

00:35:54.966 --> 00:35:56.592
What kind of teeth do they even have?

00:35:56.676 --> 00:35:58.761
Strong enough to chew concrete.

00:35:58.844 --> 00:36:00.680
Wow.

00:36:02.265 --> 00:36:06.227
Pill bugs and us, we're both unstoppable.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:08.104
-Unstoppable?
-A little.

00:36:08.604 --> 00:36:09.981
Just a little bit unstoppable.

00:36:10.064 --> 00:36:11.941
That makes no sense.

00:36:13.484 --> 00:36:15.778
It really helped having you with me.

00:36:16.487 --> 00:36:18.572
I couldn't have done it alone.

00:36:19.991 --> 00:36:20.908
Hanzo.

00:36:22.576 --> 00:36:23.577
I love you.

00:36:24.954 --> 00:36:26.122
That made my heart flutter!

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.084
Ninety-eight, 99,

00:36:30.751 --> 00:36:31.919
100.

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:07.413
Even remotes emit electromagnetic waves…

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:47.328
Where?

00:37:48.037 --> 00:37:49.455
What's unexpected?

00:37:50.164 --> 00:37:51.374
Where does it start?

00:37:57.755 --> 00:38:02.176
A safe gift or a bold one.
Which is better?

00:38:02.802 --> 00:38:05.429
A bold one. What about you?

00:38:05.513 --> 00:38:06.931
A safe gift.

00:38:07.014 --> 00:38:08.516
What?

00:38:08.599 --> 00:38:11.060
If it's too bold, it could backfire.

00:38:11.769 --> 00:38:12.812
Like a sea cucumber?

00:38:13.729 --> 00:38:15.773
-That's bold.
-Do you like them?

00:38:16.607 --> 00:38:18.192
I don't hate them.

00:38:19.402 --> 00:38:21.362
-Jellyfish?
-I like those.

00:38:21.445 --> 00:38:22.530
Me too.

00:38:23.197 --> 00:38:24.532
I want to go to the aquarium.

00:38:24.615 --> 00:38:26.700
Ah, you mean not to eat.

00:38:26.784 --> 00:38:28.077
You meant to eat?

00:38:30.788 --> 00:38:32.540
-The sea?
-Love it.

00:38:32.623 --> 00:38:35.626
-The mountains?
-If it's picnicking.

00:38:35.709 --> 00:38:38.504
-Amusement parks?
-Love them. Roller coasters?

00:38:39.255 --> 00:38:41.382
-Hate them.
-Bungee jumping?

00:38:41.465 --> 00:38:42.758
Don't see the point.

00:38:42.842 --> 00:38:45.219
Wow, we're not compatible.

00:38:45.302 --> 00:38:47.179
We can't agree on everything.

00:38:50.057 --> 00:38:50.975
Rainy days?

00:38:51.642 --> 00:38:52.518
I like them.

00:38:53.185 --> 00:38:54.019
Rain boots?

00:38:54.103 --> 00:38:55.479
Love them.

00:38:55.563 --> 00:38:56.897
And raincoats too.

00:38:56.981 --> 00:38:58.107
Thought so.

00:38:59.191 --> 00:39:00.609
The smell after rain.

00:39:01.944 --> 00:39:02.820
Love it.

00:39:02.903 --> 00:39:04.989
Same here. We're the same.

00:39:08.534 --> 00:39:10.619
So cute. I like these.

00:39:11.954 --> 00:39:15.082
A bit cheap for a gift, isn't it?

00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:17.460
Look! This one is you.

00:39:17.543 --> 00:39:19.170
I'm a bee?

00:39:19.253 --> 00:39:23.299
Like a bug that swarms around
sweet, delicious nectar.

00:39:23.382 --> 00:39:25.050
Please stop. It sounds bad.

00:39:25.134 --> 00:39:26.302
A worker bee, then.

00:39:26.385 --> 00:39:28.387
That's sad.

00:39:29.763 --> 00:39:33.184
Look. They've got phone straps too.

00:39:33.809 --> 00:39:35.227
Oh, yeah.

00:39:36.604 --> 00:39:37.563
Okay.

00:39:43.736 --> 00:39:45.446
You sure this was okay?

00:39:46.822 --> 00:39:48.157
I wanted something matching.

00:39:49.617 --> 00:39:51.952
How is it? Do you like it?

00:39:55.706 --> 00:39:56.874
I do.

00:39:58.083 --> 00:39:59.919
A bug clinging to your chest.

00:40:00.002 --> 00:40:01.837
Stop it.

00:40:02.505 --> 00:40:03.797
You said it first.

00:40:06.258 --> 00:40:07.384
Here you go.

00:40:09.929 --> 00:40:10.930
Thanks.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.247
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

00:41:21.083 --> 00:41:24.670
One's enough,
or the cake will be full of holes.

00:41:24.753 --> 00:41:25.796
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:41:28.173 --> 00:41:30.801
Happy birthday.

00:41:30.884 --> 00:41:32.428
Thank you.

00:41:33.679 --> 00:41:35.180
Any wishes for the year?

00:41:38.559 --> 00:41:41.895
To get along with Bunty this year.

00:41:43.897 --> 00:41:47.443
And next year and the year after
and forever after that.

00:41:48.235 --> 00:41:50.070
May we always be happy together.

00:41:53.032 --> 00:41:54.700
I only asked about this year.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.619
A bit greedy, don't you think?

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:02.207
Do you like greedy, clingy girls?

00:42:09.298 --> 00:42:10.257
I love you.

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:22.311
Here I go.

00:42:50.422 --> 00:42:51.507
Esper?

00:43:04.269 --> 00:43:05.312
I found it.

00:44:14.673 --> 00:44:16.884
‎-‎An enemy to the hero?
‎-Villian?

00:44:16.967 --> 00:44:18.844
‎Espers are probably…

00:44:18.927 --> 00:44:20.929
‎Big Five!

00:44:21.638 --> 00:44:22.598
‎Hanzo!

00:44:22.681 --> 00:44:24.767
‎-Ow!
‎-‎You can't read minds?

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.059
‎Watch out!
‎You guys are the villains, aren't you?

00:44:26.143 --> 00:44:27.853
‎Stop the tears!
