What?

00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.256
You were rubbing your eye so hard,

Sorry?

No, no. That's not what I meant.

I'm Blue Finger. I'm proper.

00:24:04.733 --> 00:24:08.567
I'm Black Finger. I'm very popular.

00:24:08.567 --> 00:24:12.367
I'm Khaki Finger. I'm tall.

00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:15.808
I'm Brown Finger. I've got luscious hair.

00:24:15.808 --> 00:24:18.067
Gosh, what do I do?

00:24:18.067 --> 00:24:19.133
What do I do?

00:24:19.133 --> 00:24:20.800
I'm Red Finger.

[Handsome Guys All Deserve Respect]
I'm obviously handsome

00:24:22.233 --> 00:24:23.967
and tall. My legs by themselves
are almost two meters long.

00:24:23.967 --> 00:24:25.400
- Cut!
- And

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.367

- I sound sweet even over the phone.
- Let me pretend to be Geu Rin.

00:24:30.733 --> 00:24:32.367
Hey!

00:24:32.367 --> 00:24:33.767
This isn't a one-man show, you punk!

I'm Baeblu Finger.

00:24:49.267 --> 00:24:51.267
I've got nothing to boast about.

00:24:51.267 --> 00:24:52.633
I'll pretend to be Baeblu.

00:24:52.633 --> 00:24:54.400
I'm Baeblu Finger.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.067
I'm cute, charming, and smart.

But if someone covers for you,
you'll need to withdraw your membership.

00:24:59.533 --> 00:25:00.567
If you can't handle it,
we'll process your withdrawal...

00:25:00.567 --> 00:25:02.633
I'll try again.

I've got nice skin.

I rarely get acne.

00:25:20.567 --> 00:25:22.400
I'm good at grammar.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.267
I'm also good at jumping rope.

00:25:25.267 --> 00:25:28.267
And I studied hard during the last exam,

00:25:28.267 --> 00:25:31.100
so my midterm grades improved a bit!

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.900
That's all!

00:25:37.633 --> 00:25:40.967
Everybody, give it up for Baeblu Finger!

00:25:49.856 --> 00:25:52.567
I went all out.

00:26:04.576 --> 00:26:07.033
You were quite good at bragging.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.133
I get anxious presenting in front of people.

00:26:12.133 --> 00:26:16.233
But I thought of it as just showing
my drawings to other members.

00:26:16.233 --> 00:26:18.767
That's how I approached it.

00:26:18.767 --> 00:26:20.667
It wasn't as scary as you thought, right?

00:26:20.667 --> 00:26:22.433
Right.

00:26:22.433 --> 00:26:26.333
You became braver under people's gazes.

00:26:26.333 --> 00:26:29.600
- Yes.
- It was good that I brought you here, right?

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.467
Yes.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.400
But on that day,

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.400
why me of all people?

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.633
There were many stellar people.

00:26:40.633 --> 00:26:42.367
Deal!

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:44.767
Still, I'm not dead.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.133
It's just

00:26:50.133 --> 00:26:52.767
that you reminded me of my younger self.

00:26:52.767 --> 00:26:54.700
I used to

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:59.100
constantly suppress my desires
because I was afraid of what others thought.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.467
You did?

00:27:01.467 --> 00:27:03.100
No way.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.067
It's true.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.400
Thank you for letting me join SF.

00:27:20.352 --> 00:27:23.133
Oh my, who do we have here?

00:27:23.133 --> 00:27:25.100
Geu Rin!

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.067
You just got here? It's already finished.

00:27:27.067 --> 00:27:29.533
U Yeon, you look pretty today.

00:27:29.533 --> 00:27:30.567
The older members did it for me.

00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:33.600
It seems that things still
run smoothly without me.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.800
I'll go back in first.

00:27:47.712 --> 00:27:49.833
What's with that face?

00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:15.200
Do you want me to take it for you?

00:28:24.667 --> 00:28:26.500
I'm sorry.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.667
It was time for a new one anyway.
Don't worry about it.

00:28:28.667 --> 00:28:30.100
No, of course I should...

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.267
Forget it.

00:28:32.267 --> 00:28:33.433
But it was my fault.

00:28:33.433 --> 00:28:34.667
I said forget it.

00:28:34.667 --> 00:28:37.267
You're too young to have money.

00:28:39.968 --> 00:28:42.167
I have money.

00:28:42.167 --> 00:28:43.744
And

00:28:43.744 --> 00:28:45.567
I'm not a kid.

00:28:50.208 --> 00:28:52.700
Since it was my fault,

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.600
I'll buy you a new one.

00:28:57.967 --> 00:29:00.033
Khaki, are you leaving?

00:29:01.733 --> 00:29:03.833
Was Khaki upset?

00:29:03.833 --> 00:29:06.400
Everything is so strange today.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.867
Who knew he could get angry?

00:29:12.767 --> 00:29:14.733
Khaki, are you leaving?

00:29:19.904 --> 00:29:21.984
So you

00:29:21.984 --> 00:29:23.767
need more time?

00:29:23.767 --> 00:29:27.700
Basically, you threw me two curveballs.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.467
I need time to confirm my feelings too.

00:29:30.467 --> 00:29:32.067
Okay.

00:29:32.067 --> 00:29:34.100
How much time do you need?

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.233
As you know, I don't have much time.

00:29:36.233 --> 00:29:37.767
Hey, how would I know?

00:29:37.767 --> 00:29:38.867
Just go with the flow...

00:29:38.867 --> 00:29:41.133
Then I'll help you figure it out quickly.

00:29:41.133 --> 00:29:43.367
Nobody knows you better than me.

00:29:43.367 --> 00:29:45.167
What?

00:29:46.368 --> 00:29:50.133
When you are told not to think of elephants,

00:29:50.133 --> 00:29:51.967
you immediately picture one.

00:29:51.967 --> 00:29:54.500
What? Elephants?

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.500
Why are you talking about
elephants out of nowhere?

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.368
I take back my confession

00:29:58.368 --> 00:30:00.567
for the time being.

00:30:00.567 --> 00:30:02.600
But,

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.400
don't ever miss me.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.400
Don't ever think about how charming I am.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.200
Don't ever think of me in a new light.

00:30:14.592 --> 00:30:16.667
Got it?

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.633
Let's go now.

00:30:27.767 --> 00:30:29.600
That crazy...

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.300
I want to ask you something.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.600
What?

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.733
Are you going to spout nonsense again?

00:30:51.733 --> 00:30:54.900
No, listen.

00:30:57.152 --> 00:30:59.200
You know,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.912
I did the thing to your eye.

00:31:02.912 --> 00:31:05.233
But you still don't know if you like me or not?

00:31:05.233 --> 00:31:06.800
Gosh, you're spouting nonsense again!

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.733
Hey, how is that nonsense?

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:11.067
- That day we...
- Go over there!

00:31:14.752 --> 00:31:16.533
Sorry.

00:31:16.533 --> 00:31:20.800
But I'm not doing this on purpose.

00:31:21.567 --> 00:31:24.033
It's my first time liking someone,

00:31:24.033 --> 00:31:26.533
so I don't know how to act.

00:31:28.233 --> 00:31:30.167
First time?

00:31:30.167 --> 00:31:32.833
You've never liked anyone?

00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:34.933
No.

00:31:34.933 --> 00:31:36.000
Liar.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.733
Why would I lie to you?

00:31:37.733 --> 00:31:39.200
Who'd believe that?

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.067
A guy like you has never had a girlfriend?

00:31:41.067 --> 00:31:42.700
Gosh, never!

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.400
I said never!

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.600
You're my first!

00:31:51.167 --> 00:31:55.200
Okay, fine.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.600
I'd believe you

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.900
even if you said soybean paste is made with beans.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.467
But you really don't trust me?

00:32:02.867 --> 00:32:06.533
Soybean paste is made with beans anyway.

00:32:08.256 --> 00:32:11.333
Then what do you make with red beans?

00:32:11.333 --> 00:32:13.433
Probably red bean porridge.

[Certificate]

00:32:23.136 --> 00:32:26.867
Make sure you wear them tomorrow, okay?

00:32:32.032 --> 00:32:33.667
Hey, Bong Gu.

00:32:33.667 --> 00:32:36.033
Why do you keep hanging out with Song U Dol?

00:32:36.033 --> 00:32:38.100
Why not?

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.433
Why can't I hang out with him?

00:32:39.433 --> 00:32:42.700
Hey. He doesn't even consider you a friend.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.400
He probably threw away the socks you gave him.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.633
No way.

00:32:46.633 --> 00:32:49.633
Wait. It's Song U Dol.

Hey, Song U Dol.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.400
Didn't Bong Gu give you socks?

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.200
You're wearing them because you're friends, right?

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.233
Take your shoes off. Let's see them.

00:32:59.767 --> 00:33:00.967
Come on, let's see them!

00:33:00.967 --> 00:33:02.667
- Take your shoes off!
- Don't do that!

00:33:02.667 --> 00:33:04.900
Stay still!

00:33:05.696 --> 00:33:09.000
Don't! I said stop!

00:33:09.733 --> 00:33:10.833
See?

00:33:10.833 --> 00:33:12.500
He's awful like that.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.467
- I pity you, Bong Gu.
- U Dol!

00:33:16.467 --> 00:33:18.267
My grandma said,

00:33:18.267 --> 00:33:21.233
ganging up on someone is wrong.

00:33:21.233 --> 00:33:23.776
You guys are mean!

00:33:23.776 --> 00:33:25.600
Jeez.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.667
Bong Gu.

00:33:26.667 --> 00:33:28.933
He treats you like dirt. Why do you take his side?

00:33:28.933 --> 00:33:30.633
Are you really that stupid?

00:33:30.633 --> 00:33:33.000
Why do you keep saying that?

00:33:39.133 --> 00:33:41.833
Who's treating him like dirt?

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.367
U Dol!

00:33:50.367 --> 00:33:53.467
Just because I wore these socks,
it doesn't make us friends.

00:33:53.467 --> 00:33:55.133
Let me make this clear. I don't need friends...

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:56.933
U Dol!

00:33:56.933 --> 00:33:58.800
Go away!

00:33:59.999 --> 00:34:01.696
Oh my!

00:34:01.696 --> 00:34:04.167
Did you guys hear the news?

00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:06.600
Min Ho's mom got divorced, apparently.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.533
Really?

00:34:08.533 --> 00:34:11.533
I heard her husband cheated on her.

00:34:11.533 --> 00:34:13.200
Oh my, how awful.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.400
No wonder she hasn't been around lately.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.048
You're all so nosy about others' business.

00:34:18.048 --> 00:34:20.320
Now this

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.800
is the book U Dol was reading.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.167
Oh my, I know this book.

00:34:25.167 --> 00:34:29.000
So U Dol's into this?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.848
How many volumes are there?

00:34:30.848 --> 00:34:32.867
Is it a series?

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.600
Wow, it looks great.

00:34:38.848 --> 00:34:40.133
I'm going to buy a new lip tint.

00:34:40.133 --> 00:34:41.367
But you already bought one recently.

00:34:41.367 --> 00:34:42.967
They released a new version.

00:34:42.967 --> 00:34:44.400
Song would look pretty with makeup too.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.633
I know.

00:34:45.633 --> 00:34:48.333
What? Where is this confidence coming from?

00:34:48.333 --> 00:34:51.267
But I like myself the way I look now.

00:34:51.267 --> 00:34:53.067
I don't have pimples

00:34:53.067 --> 00:34:54.300
and I like the way my eyes look too.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.067
What's going on, Song? Since when
did you become so confident?

00:34:57.067 --> 00:34:58.267
They say love changes people.

00:34:58.267 --> 00:34:59.500
It's not like that.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.033
Is romantic Poop Boy coming today?

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:03.867
How's the progress? What else have you done?

00:35:03.867 --> 00:35:06.067
It's not like that.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.900
Look at this.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.167
Isn't the color amazing?

00:35:10.167 --> 00:35:12.833
It's the same as what you bought last time.

00:35:12.833 --> 00:35:14.700
No, it's different!

00:35:16.667 --> 00:35:17.700
It looks the same to me.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.400
Gosh, it's not!

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.233
Try putting it on.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.900
Hey, isn't this color gorgeous?

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.933
Not bad.

00:35:28.933 --> 00:35:31.867
There are so many new ones. Awesome.

00:35:31.867 --> 00:35:33.133
What's wrong, Song?

00:35:33.133 --> 00:35:34.400
Hey, what's wrong?

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.200
Stay still.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.967
Just stay still for a second.

00:35:38.967 --> 00:35:42.367
Oh, it's pretty.

00:35:42.367 --> 00:35:46.667
Wow, this totally suits me.

00:35:46.667 --> 00:35:48.067
- Let me see.
- It's so glittery.

00:35:48.067 --> 00:35:50.133
- Can you put it on me?
- Let me do it for you.

00:35:50.133 --> 00:35:51.867
- Make it pretty.
- Try it.

00:35:51.867 --> 00:35:53.833
This one's really pretty.

00:35:55.904 --> 00:35:57.533
How do I look?

00:35:57.533 --> 00:35:59.033
- Does it look okay?
- What?

00:35:59.033 --> 00:36:00.633
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

00:36:00.633 --> 00:36:03.167
Forget it. I'm fine now.

00:36:03.167 --> 00:36:04.833
What do you mean 'fine'?

00:36:04.833 --> 00:36:06.400
- I won't let them slide.
- Just drop it.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.267
I said I'm fine now.

00:36:08.267 --> 00:36:10.500
Let's go.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.100
Gosh, this is so annoying.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.560
Hey,

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.200
are you crying?

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.233
Yes, I am.

00:36:18.233 --> 00:36:20.100
You've been through something really terrible,

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.280
yet I was giggling cluelessly.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.667
I'm crying because I feel pathetic and frustrated.

00:36:22.667 --> 00:36:24.367
Mi Rae's right.

00:36:24.367 --> 00:36:26.133
You should've told us about what happened.

00:36:26.133 --> 00:36:27.967
We're friends.

00:36:28.933 --> 00:36:30.767
I'm sorry.

00:36:31.767 --> 00:36:33.500
I was scared you'd be disappointed in me.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.800
Hey!

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.900
What do you take us for?

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.000
Do you think we're that shallow?

00:36:40.733 --> 00:36:42.833
I'm really sorry.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.233
No, I'm sorry.

00:36:47.233 --> 00:36:49.533
No, what do you have to be sorry for?

00:36:49.533 --> 00:36:51.533
No, I'm the one who should apologize.

00:36:51.533 --> 00:36:53.500
- Stop it!
- I'm truly sorry.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.367
- No, I'm really sorry!
- You guys, seriously...

00:36:55.367 --> 00:36:56.533
No!

00:36:56.533 --> 00:36:57.667
- I'm sorry!
- Don't say that.

00:36:57.667 --> 00:37:00.567
- Just stop this, please.
- I'm sorry.

00:37:00.567 --> 00:37:02.368
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.633
When you are told not to think of elephants,

00:37:06.633 --> 00:37:09.000
you immediately picture one.

00:37:10.467 --> 00:37:12.067
What was that about?

00:37:12.067 --> 00:37:14.267
Some kind of spell?

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.933
That can't be.

00:37:17.933 --> 00:37:19.667
No, wait.

00:37:19.667 --> 00:37:21.433
This feels familiar.

00:37:21.433 --> 00:37:23.667
Like déjà vu.

00:37:23.667 --> 00:37:28.367
Gosh, what was it...

00:37:30.133 --> 00:37:32.233
Gosh, what on earth was that about, Koo Seon Ho?

00:37:32.233 --> 00:37:33.867
That coward!

00:37:33.867 --> 00:37:36.100
Bring back my old Seon Ho! Give him back!

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.433
Shut up, seriously!

00:37:37.433 --> 00:37:38.633
Seon Ho, Seon Ho.

00:37:38.633 --> 00:37:40.384
Enough already! Seriously.

00:37:41.967 --> 00:37:44.200
How dare you barge into my room!

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.267
Unbelievable.

00:37:45.267 --> 00:37:47.433
I'll call Seon Ho to take you away right now.

00:37:47.433 --> 00:37:48.733
Don't you dare.

00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:51.733
I'll show U Yeon your 100-day baby photos.

00:37:51.733 --> 00:37:54.700
- What?
- Your 100-day baby photos.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.733
Those photos of you as a naked baby!

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.267
Do you have a death wish?

00:38:00.267 --> 00:38:01.600
Why not? Let's go down together!

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.833
Call him! Do it!

00:38:04.833 --> 00:38:07.667
Just try showing her!

00:38:07.667 --> 00:38:09.700
Hey, wait!

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.000
When you are told not to think of elephants,
you immediately picture one.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Is this some kind of spell?

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.800
What nonsense?

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.267
That rude brat.

00:38:26.467 --> 00:38:28.667
Koo Seon Ho.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.900
Seon Ho!

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.600
Could you share your study guide with us?

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.333
Sure, I'll give it to you later.

00:38:41.333 --> 00:38:45.267
That punk. Since when
did his smile become so captivating...

00:38:45.267 --> 00:38:47.267
Don't ever think about how charming I am.

00:38:47.267 --> 00:38:48.600
What am I even saying?

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.833
Shut up! Shut up!

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.667
Wait.

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:58.133
Why does this spell feel familiar?

00:38:58.867 --> 00:39:01.567
Darn it, I left my phone. I'll be right back.

00:39:01.567 --> 00:39:03.067
I'll come with you.

00:39:03.067 --> 00:39:05.433
Don't bother. I'll be quick.

00:39:05.433 --> 00:39:08.600
Don't make eye contact.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.600
What?

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.000
You don't know?

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.967
If you lock eyes with Apollo's bust

00:39:13.967 --> 00:39:16.457
in an empty studio,

00:39:16.457 --> 00:39:18.700
you'll see ghosts.

00:39:20.544 --> 00:39:21.667
Huh?

00:39:21.667 --> 00:39:23.033
Don't act like a little kid.

00:39:23.033 --> 00:39:27.633
Stay here and wait while I go get it.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.300
I wasn't kidding.

Why won't this turn on?

00:39:59.133 --> 00:40:02.200
If you lock eyes with Apollo's bust

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.900
in an empty studio, you'll see ghosts.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.433
Why did Seon Ho talk such nonsense?

00:40:12.133 --> 00:40:16.640
If you lock eyes with Apollo's bust,
you'll see ghosts.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.367
Gosh.

00:40:18.367 --> 00:40:20.600
Let's not think about it.

00:40:22.233 --> 00:40:25.833
Why did he have to say that?

00:40:25.833 --> 00:40:30.867

Jeez,

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.967
that startled me!

00:40:48.933 --> 00:40:50.900
Why is it over here?

Got it?

00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:18.433

what are you doing?

No.

I came to prove he can't put a spell on me.

00:42:09.733 --> 00:42:13.367
Jeez, didn't he just get to the library?

00:42:13.367 --> 00:42:16.800

the true face of our top student?

Wait, have his eyelashes
always been this beautiful?

00:42:55.733 --> 00:42:58.600
Has his nose always been this prominent?

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.333
Have his lips always this...

00:43:04.333 --> 00:43:06.467
What, what am I doing?

Hey, honey.

You can't come up again this week?

00:44:04.133 --> 00:44:06.933
That must be so hard for you.

00:44:06.933 --> 00:44:09.900

00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:26.033
Just eat first.

00:44:27.033 --> 00:44:29.733
Will you keep doing this to me?

00:44:30.867 --> 00:44:32.700
Here.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.200
Yes, honey. No, it's okay.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.367
It's nothing.

00:44:35.367 --> 00:44:36.928
No big deal.

00:45:12.033 --> 00:45:14.100
Jo Mi Ryo even asked for my phone number.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.900
Oh no, this is serious.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:17.500
I'm into Se Ra, you know?

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.500
Wow, really? You're in trouble.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.467
Se Ra.

00:45:22.467 --> 00:45:23.833
I'm telling the truth!

00:45:23.833 --> 00:45:26.720
That ugly guy is 100% into me.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.400
Jeez.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.600
But I like Tae Seon.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.633
I'm pretty sure he has a girlfriend.

00:45:32.633 --> 00:45:35.100
What? Tae Seon has a girlfriend?

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.600
[I'm going to the study room.]
How do you know that?

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.367
I just saw them together once.

00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:41.333
[Poop Boy: Studying too hard? Take it hard.]
Where? How?

00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:42.833
Hey, how is that possible?

00:45:42.833 --> 00:45:47.267
[Not 'take it hard' but 'take it easy.']

00:45:47.267 --> 00:45:51.033
[I'm studying spilling starting today.]

00:45:51.033 --> 00:45:54.272
[Spelling]

00:45:57.376 --> 00:46:00.667
Ye Rim, you're early.

00:46:00.667 --> 00:46:02.800
Oh, right. Eun Gi's running late.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.667
Really?

00:46:04.667 --> 00:46:07.333
We'll just wait.

00:46:07.333 --> 00:46:08.533
Hi, Gi Jeong.

00:46:08.533 --> 00:46:10.300
Hey.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.367
Gosh, it's hot.

00:46:12.367 --> 00:46:14.800
- When's he coming?
- Who knows?

00:46:24.267 --> 00:46:28.000
You must be really hot. You're sweating so much.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.833
Don't bother.

00:46:56.733 --> 00:46:57.867
Is everything going okay?

00:46:57.867 --> 00:46:59.867
Yes, it is.

00:46:59.867 --> 00:47:01.900
Sorry to interrupt your busy schedule.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.800
Not at all.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.633
So what did you want to talk about?

00:47:05.633 --> 00:47:07.667
I don't have friends

00:47:07.667 --> 00:47:11.000
or anyone to consult about my problems,

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.900
so I wanted your advice.

00:47:15.133 --> 00:47:18.867
I'm not sure if I can help, but sure.

00:47:18.867 --> 00:47:20.533
What's going on?

00:47:20.533 --> 00:47:24.133
I'm working part-time
as a model for a shopping mall.

00:47:24.133 --> 00:47:25.767
But should I keep doing it

00:47:25.767 --> 00:47:28.867
or focus on studying?

00:47:28.867 --> 00:47:30.500
I don't know what to do.

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.933
You're a model?

00:47:31.933 --> 00:47:34.067
Yes, do you want to see my photos?

00:47:34.067 --> 00:47:35.900
Sure.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.000
Wow.

00:47:39.633 --> 00:47:42.200
This is you, Ye Rim?

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.900
You look so pretty.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:46.800
I'm so envious.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.433
I'm not even famous or anything.

00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:52.133
No, I'm genuinely envious.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.832
Huh?

00:48:04.033 --> 00:48:06.133
Nam Gi Jeong?

00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:08.800
Do you know Gi Jeong?

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.733
What?

00:48:12.533 --> 00:48:13.533
Yes.

00:48:13.533 --> 00:48:16.100
How do you know Gi Jeong?

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.500
He and I are in the same croquis club.

00:48:25.433 --> 00:48:28.833
Gi Jeong is interested in someone.

00:48:28.833 --> 00:48:30.900
What?

00:48:31.567 --> 00:48:36.200
They met at the croquis
or drawing club, or whatever.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.367
Then do you

00:48:40.233 --> 00:48:43.267
get to see him at every meeting?

00:48:43.267 --> 00:48:45.100
Yes.

00:48:47.936 --> 00:48:49.933
Why do you ask?

00:48:49.933 --> 00:48:51.833
Actually,

00:48:51.833 --> 00:48:55.533
Gi Jeong is my ex-boyfriend.

00:48:55.533 --> 00:48:56.567
What?

00:48:56.567 --> 00:48:59.067
There was some misunderstanding between us,

00:48:59.067 --> 00:49:03.167
so now we just do modeling work together.

00:49:03.167 --> 00:49:04.544
Oh,

00:49:04.544 --> 00:49:06.067
I see.

00:49:06.067 --> 00:49:07.967
That's how it is.

00:49:10.833 --> 00:49:12.367
U Yeon.

00:49:12.367 --> 00:49:15.000
Could you please help me just once?

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.833
Please take me to that drawing club.

00:49:17.833 --> 00:49:20.833
I want to see Gi Jeong draw

00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:25.533
and I also want to get back together with him.

00:49:26.267 --> 00:49:29.000
Please, U Yeon.

00:49:37.856 --> 00:49:40.933
Thank you for talking to me today, U Yeon.

00:49:40.933 --> 00:49:42.528
I'll go now.

00:49:42.528 --> 00:49:44.167
See you again soon.

00:49:44.167 --> 00:49:46.333
Okay, take care.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.333
It's my first time liking someone.

00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:01.200
First time?

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.933
You've never liked anyone?

00:50:03.933 --> 00:50:05.933
No.

00:50:05.933 --> 00:50:07.067
Liar.

00:50:07.067 --> 00:50:10.500
You'd better like me.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.500
I just like you.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:16.900
When someone likes someone else,
does there have to be a reason?

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:18.112
So then,

00:50:18.112 --> 00:50:20.500
I can keep liking you, right?

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.800
What?

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.933
Liar.

00:50:31.867 --> 00:50:33.033
[Poop Boy: Miss Piggy, I'm studying spilling.]

00:50:33.033 --> 00:50:35.168
[Spelling.]

00:50:38.656 --> 00:50:41.267
I'm not even dating Nam Gi Jeong.

00:50:41.267 --> 00:50:43.933
Why should I care if he lied?

00:50:48.864 --> 00:50:51.367
Why did he say that?

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.967
Punk.

00:50:55.033 --> 00:50:56.033
He said I should trust him.

00:50:56.033 --> 00:51:00.000
Beans or whatever. I knew this would happen.

00:51:07.967 --> 00:51:13.536
[Ahn Ye Rim: U Yeon, my request was too absurd.
Please don't worry about it. I'm sorry.]

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.733
Where on earth did Delulu go?

00:51:28.064 --> 00:51:30.112
Right,

00:51:30.112 --> 00:51:33.533
I don't even like Nam Gi Jeong,

00:51:33.533 --> 00:51:36.433
we're not dating,

00:51:36.433 --> 00:51:37.920
and

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.700
we don't even look good together.

00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:57.933
Can I bring a friend to this week's meeting?

00:51:57.933 --> 00:51:59.767
What's this?

00:52:11.168 --> 00:52:14.533
Ye Rim, are you free this week?

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:36.233
Is this the person you wanted to bring?

00:52:36.233 --> 00:52:38.767
You really don't understand. She likes me.

00:52:38.767 --> 00:52:41.167
- What does that have to do with me?
- What?

00:52:41.167 --> 00:52:42.848
Cute and sexy.

00:52:42.848 --> 00:52:45.467
Koo Seon Ho fell in love with someone?

00:52:45.467 --> 00:52:46.800
It doesn't sit too well with me.

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.633
It's one thing if we were unaware.

00:52:48.633 --> 00:52:50.333
But now that we know, how can we just ignore it?

00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:53.967
Baeblu's friends are great.
Baeblu will handle it, right?

00:52:53.967 --> 00:52:56.333
How long will you keep ignoring me?

00:52:56.333 --> 00:52:57.767
Does being with Koo Seon Ho exciting?

00:52:57.767 --> 00:53:01.600
Because of you, I owe U Yeon for life.

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.233
Thanks, Ahn Ye Rim.

00:53:03.233 --> 00:53:06.208
Thank you, Ye Rim.

00:53:15.552 --> 00:53:17.200
Do you like her that much?

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.133
She's pretty and smart,
and has a good personality.

00:53:20.133 --> 00:53:23.267
Only a fool wouldn't like her.

00:53:23.267 --> 00:53:25.433
Here comes the fool.

00:53:25.433 --> 00:53:27.467
Hey, Poop Boy!

00:53:27.467 --> 00:53:29.033
[Ahn Ye Rim: Gi Jeong, are you busy?]

00:53:29.033 --> 00:53:31.168
[Here is a picture I took today.]
