...to return to seats.

00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:14.072
I heard an investment firm won this bid,

00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:16.324
but isn't it reckless
to let a company like that

00:02:16.408 --> 00:02:18.577
handle national data security?

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.872
Somehow they bypassed getting
their credentials verified.

00:02:21.955 --> 00:02:23.290
I'm sure money played a part.

00:02:23.373 --> 00:02:25.751
-Let's sit there.
-They weren't in the initial bid.

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:29.379
But they showed up in the final round
and snatched up the project.

00:02:29.463 --> 00:02:31.506
There's something fishy about it.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.800
Why make us come
all the way out to the boonies?

00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:36.261
They think they can do
whatever they want with us.

00:02:36.344 --> 00:02:38.555
-Should we shake them up a little?
-[chuckling]

00:02:48.648 --> 00:02:50.609
Allow me to shed some light, gentlemen.

00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:53.820
That company has roots
in security solutions

00:02:53.904 --> 00:02:56.656
and now manages data
for a major portal in Korea.

00:02:57.073 --> 00:02:59.326
Now, what did you say earlier?

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.746
Hmm? You'd shake them up?

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.457
You underestimate their power.

00:03:06.124 --> 00:03:09.419
Every last detail about the three of you
can be easily collected.

00:03:09.503 --> 00:03:12.589
The only reason they haven't is,
you aren't worth the trouble.

00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:15.300
-[laughs] What do you mean?
-Their pockets are deep

00:03:16.384 --> 00:03:19.054
and the C.E.O. has many interests.

00:03:19.137 --> 00:03:21.890
And because of that, they became
an investment company

00:03:21.973 --> 00:03:23.934
in order to manage various enterprises.

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:29.564
But their core business is data security,
and that was why they won in the end.

00:03:30.398 --> 00:03:34.653
One of the conditions was that the bidder
had to construct the data center nearby,

00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:36.655
but it was taken out in a revision.

00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:39.866
That's highly unusual, don't you think?

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.494
Global companies build centers
in polar regions

00:03:42.577 --> 00:03:44.913
for the purpose of improving
power efficiency.

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:47.374
But that seemed a bit too far away.

00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:50.585
That's why we're building it here.

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.546

Well, they probably have a close friend
in high places.

I'm not some employee.

I'm the owner of this entire company.
