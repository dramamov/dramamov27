WEBVTT

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.070
Madam Jang is...

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.040
David Jung's...

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.880
or Jung Ho Se's...

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.720
birth mother.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.650
She's Ho Se's...

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.220
birth mother?

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.930
(Episode 98)

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.560
No way. How is that possible?

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.800
What are you even saying right now?

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.870
You...

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.540
If this isn't true, I swear
I won't let you get away with this!

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.100
It's true.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.940
That portrait that was delivered
to the CEO's office.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.940
I saw it in Madam Jang's room, remember?

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.150
You said only the bereaved family
could have it.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.250
And I spoke to Madam Jang myself.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.950
So that means...

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.990
- Madam Jang is really his mother?
- Go see for yourself.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.780
That was quite a show earlier.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.880
Min Kyung Chae,
seething in the chairman's office.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.750
I almost wanted to take a picture
so I could look at it when I'm bored.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.290
She never would've guessed
you'd have the deciding vote.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.600
She should've tried to live a better life.
Why cause trouble and hurt people?

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.500
She's just reaping what she sowed.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.370
I hope she learns her lesson from this,
but she's not the type.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.600
Tell me about it.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.940
I don't get why my son, of all people,
fell for a girl like Min Kyung Chae.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.550
Does this make you feel a little better?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.020
When I think about my Ho Se,
not even close.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.820
Not until I destroy
Min Kyung Chae and Min Se Ri,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.090
the mother and daughter,
with my own hands.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.920
I'll admit,
that was a little satisfying earlier.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.230
If she finds out
that the three percent stake...

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.400
came from that brat Se Ri,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.430
she's going to lose her mind.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.800
What should I do?
This is all too entertaining...

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.240
that I don't think I can sleep tonight.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.310
It's all thanks to you.
You've always guided and looked after me.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.110
Why so formal all of a sudden?

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.580
Come on, we're family.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.490
We're going to see this through
to the end together, no matter what.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.760
So don't you worry.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.330
From now on, you just focus on
officially taking over the chairmanship.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.030
You need to get rid of that
"acting" label as soon as possible.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.900
Who could that be at this hour?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.640
Open the door, now!

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.540
- I said, open this door!
- That voice...

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.380
Lucia, I have to go. I'll call you back.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.060
What brings you here at this hour?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.400
Come to think of it,
she looks so much like him.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.100
How did I not see it before?

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.100
Ms. Min. Are you listening to me?

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.070
What are you thinking about?

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.340
Are you...

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.340
Ho Se's mother?

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.320
Do you want to sleep with me tonight?

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.490
You've been so quiet since you got back
from seeing the chairman at the hospital.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.630
I don't know when Dad will wake up,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.200
but I hope by the time he does,
our family will be different.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.740
I wish Kyung Chae and Ji Seop would
snap out of it and start living right.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.740
My poor Se Ri, you must be really upset.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.910
To be thinking all of this.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.150
It's because I feel like our family
is slowly turning into monsters.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.350
Monsters?

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.890
I'm just afraid that...

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.790
we'll get to a point
where there's no turning back.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.230
What are you still doing here?
I told you to leave.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.960
No.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.030
I can't leave like this.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.410
Just because my son briefly dated you
in the past,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.610
what difference does that make?
People date and break up all the time.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.040
It's not a big deal.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.110
It's all over now, a thing of the past.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.280
No.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.620
Ho Se and I are not a thing of the past.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.890
What's between us
is still very much alive.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.460
Get out.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.360
And don't ever come back.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.900
Ho Se and I...

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.030
are still bound to each other.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.000
What is wrong with you, Ms. Min?
Don't talk such nonsense.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.970
Why are you tormenting me?
Keep it up, and I'll call security.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.410
If you want to be dragged out of here,
then by all means, keep standing there.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.250
My Se Ri...

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.760
is Ho Se's daughter.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.330
What did you just say?

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.800
I said, my Se Ri...

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.630
is Ho Se's daughter.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.040
The daughter I secretly had 20 years ago.
Her biological father...

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.010
is your son, Madam Jang!

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.400
That's impossible.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.670
How could she...

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.070
be my son's flesh and blood?
What proof do you have?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.040
If you don't believe me,
I'll give you proof.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.620
Ultrasound photos from my pregnancy,
prenatal records, her first clothes...

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.580
I still have them all.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.620
That doesn't sound like my Ho Se.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.020
You think he wouldn't know he had a child?

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.090
Because I didn't even know myself
at the time.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.290
I had to return home suddenly
at my father's insistence,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.730
and I only found out I was pregnant
after I arrived.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.970
I was pressured to get an abortion,
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.600
Not when it was Ho Se's child.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.310
So you gave birth in secret,

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.570
registered her as Chairman Min's daughter,

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.810
and raised her, pretending she was
your younger sister?

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.280
Yes.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.320
You're Se Ri's grandmother.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.550
So how can you help Lucia
destroy Se Ri and me?

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.220
Who on earth is that woman, Lucia, to you?

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.960
What is she to you?
She's not even blood-related.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.390
Don't say that.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.200
Lucia and I share a bond
that's thicker than blood.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.900
There's nothing in this world
thicker than blood.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.800
Mingang Distribution.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.400
I planned to leave it to Se Ri someday,
but now it's in Lucia's hands.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.410
So that dream is over now.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.070
Do you know how she treats Se Ri at home?

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.140
She pretends to be a good stepmother
on the surface,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.480
but she's gaslighting my Se Ri
and manipulating her.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.580
And I'm sure you're the one
who put her up to it.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.390
You must have ordered her to destroy...

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.090
me, Se Ri, and even Mingang.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.360
Why on earth are you doing this?

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.060
Is it because I abandoned Ho Se?

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.930
Because I coldly turned my back on him
when he begged me to stay?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.970
Still, this is going too far.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.900
To your own flesh and blood!

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.270
It's your fault Ho Se ended up
the way he did!

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.940
I honestly had no idea.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.810
I just thought he was living a good life
in the US.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.710
I only found out when I received
the portrait you sent me.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.680
I never imagined my father
would do something so horrible.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.320
I...

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.890
can never forgive my father.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.920
You've heard what I did to my father,
haven't you?

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.390
What's with her?

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.900
Is she being sincere?

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.500
You've made it over the first hurdle.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.970
I'm not sure how long you'll be
the acting chairman,

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.180
but until your term is up,
hold your head high, whatever they say.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.410
All right?

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.280
I will.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.250
By the way, the team
is having a get-together tonight.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.250
Do you want to join?

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.650
Everyone's been wanting to see you.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.490
Are you sure it's okay if I tag along?

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:38.990
Of course. Why not?

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.960
You used to be on our team, right?

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:45.730
You may be the acting chairman now,
but you were once one of us.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.000
I'd love to. Thanks for including me.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.370
I've been wondering how everyone is doing.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.480
In a situation like this,
what am I supposed to do, Tae Joo?

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.520
If she really is Ho Se's daughter,

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.420
then you can't take Lucia's side, Mother.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.090
Of course I can't.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.890
That would be like plunging a dagger
into my own granddaughter's heart.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.930
Then you should meet with Lucia
and hear her side of the story.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.670
Find out how she really feels about Se Ri,

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:22.970
and what she plans to do with her.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.200
Shall I?

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.410
Oh, my.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.940
I wasn't expecting you.
What brings you here?

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.680
I was in the neighborhood,
and there's something I wanted to ask you.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.250
Ask me?

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.120
Just a moment.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.420
Hey, Se Ri.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.360
I have a team get-together,
so I'll be late. What is it?

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.100
I'll be eating out. Don't wait for me.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.470
Okay, see you later.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.280
Was that Se Ri?

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.980
Yes. She asked to have dinner together
if I get off early.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.610
Please have a seat.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.950
It seems...

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.590
she relies on you
a lot more than I realized.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.760
She'd better.
After all the effort I put into it.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.400
Anyway, what was it you wanted to ask?

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.340
What are your true intentions?

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.640
Regarding Se Ri, I mean.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.940
You asked me this before.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.080
Don't worry. None of it's sincere.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.850
Do you really think I could play mother
to the girl who caused my child's death?

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.350
Then...

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.890
are you going to make Se Ri pay later?
A child that young?

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.060
Is there an age limit on punishment?
If you commit a crime, you pay the price.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.660
Eventually, I will bring Mi So's case
back into the spotlight,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.770
and that's when I'll make sure
Se Ri is properly punished.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.530
But she's more fragile than she appears.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.670
Once she finds out Min Kyung Chae
is her birth mother,

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.310
loses the company,
and is punished on top of that,

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.580
it'll completely destroy her.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.450
So be it.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.820
Someone paid with their life,

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.380
so she should be prepared
for that, at least.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.730
So, wait, you're the only one
who skipped the team dinner?

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.590
You think I'm in any mood to join them?

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:34.630
Why are you in a bad mood?
It's Kyung Chae who should be upset.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.100
Lucia totally outplayed her.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.670
Kyung Chae won't let that get to her.
I'm the only one who feels awful.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:46.580
After all, I just found out exactly
what my own sister thinks of me.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.180
Kyung Chae is one thing,
but remember what happened before?

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.950
The way Manager Gong came at us.
Why is she involved in our family dispute?

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.950
Tell me about it.
You'd think she was Kyung Chae's mother.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:58.990
I'm starving.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.360
How come no one's called us for dinner?

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.100
Gosh, I'm starving.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:12.940
Dinner is all set. Please come and eat.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.040
We'll pass.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.780
From now on, we'll take care of ourselves,
so you can just stay out of it.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.650
Now that we know
what you really think of us,

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.050
we'd have no self-respect
if we ate food prepared by your hands.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.820
I'm surprised you haven't damaged
your vocal cords.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.690
From what I saw last time,
you're quite the screamer.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.260
You've clearly got quite a temper.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.160
That's because you two were ganging up
on Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.030
My goodness! So you're saying
you'd ride or die for Kyung Chae?

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.800
No, leave it. Let her take her side.
Even so, there are only two of them,

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.770
and there are three of us.
We have them outnumbered.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.510
Let's go, honey. Gosh.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.850
Good grief.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.510
Yes?

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.520
Hey, Soo Jung, you should be on our side.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.560
He's right, Soo Jung.
It's in your best interest to join us.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.130
What is it this time?

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.860
When you said you were giving your shares
to that woman, Lucia,

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.860
didn't that mean you were done
with Kyung Chae for good?

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.800
That means you should be on our side.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.740
We're basically
the Anti Min Kyung Chae Club.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.700
What is this?
Are we picking teams for a brawl?

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.040
Right. You already had your little brawl,
didn't you?

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.680
Darn it.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.050
Hey, you should've told me
you were coming.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.720
I didn't know we'd be coming here.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.220
Director Moon recommended it.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.590
I didn't realize your sister worked here.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.030
So you've been here before?

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.260
Yes, I came by once before...

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.700
and thought this would be the perfect spot
for a team dinner.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.300
You came to the right place.
Since my sister's here today,

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.170
I'll throw in some extras on the house.
You're in for a treat.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.640
- Excuse me.
- One second. I'll be right back.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.380
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.450
Gosh, this place is so busy.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.980
This would be a great place
to bring your family!

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.980
I had no idea there were
so many different black goat dishes.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.220
Then let's order one of everything.
It's on me tonight.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.520
Oh, no, you shouldn't.
This is our team dinner, so it's my treat.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.430
You all work so hard and put up
with a lot of drama at the office.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.800
Gosh, look at how packed this place is.
There's barely room to sit.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.200
Then we'll be sure to eat well
and recharge tonight.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.710
Director Moon. They're famous
for strong black goat extract.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.910
Everyone, grab a box of the pure extract
on your way out.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.580
- That's on me too.
- Yes!

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.650
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.280
Pass it here.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.490
Goodness! This is so good.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.030
I have to bring my parents here sometime.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.730
You've all been working so hard.
Eat up and recharge your batteries.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.470
Since everyone seems to love it,
let's have team dinners here more often.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.210
Now that Lucia's over this hurdle,
she'll be the acting chairman for real.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.180
What choice do I have?
I'll have to grit my teeth and bear it.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.820
It's hard to say if we're better off
if the chairman wakes up or doesn't.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.150
If Father remains in a coma,

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.060
that woman will become the chairman
after her acting position is over.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:24.160
Then again, even if the chairman wakes up,
he might give your spot to her anyway.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.300
So you're saying Lucia
becomes the chairman, no matter what?

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.340
You'll have to get reinstated as CEO
while the chairman is still incapacitated,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.170
convene the board, and pass a motion
to have her dismissed. It's the only way.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.640
You think I don't know that?
But it's a long shot right now.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.580
You saw it yourself.
I don't have the shares.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.010
That's why I'm saying
we need to find a way.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.620
Isn't there anyone who could help us
in a situation like this?

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.620
There is one person.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.290
You haven't eaten all day.
You're going to make yourself sick.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.930
Tae Joo, if Lucia and I became enemies,
whose side would you take?

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.930
I believe I've answered
that question before.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.470
Is Lucia on your mind that much?

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.800
You already know.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.700
You know how Lucia and I became allies.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.510
Then why don't you have Min Kyung Chae
get a DNA test...

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.610
for you and Se Ri?

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.980
If you have the results in hand, at least
you'll have grounds to stand on later.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.880
What kind of grandmother would stand by
and watch her own granddaughter get hurt?

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.990
A DNA test?

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.060
Yes.
Get a grandparentage verification test.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.810
Yes, Madam Jang.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.810
Listen to me very carefully.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.480
I want you to prove
that Se Ri is my son, Ho Se's daughter...

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.520
with a paternity test.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.420
After I see the results,

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.520
I'll decide whether or not
I'm going to take your side.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.890
Do you really mean that?

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.990
I'm sending someone over to you.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.630
They'll have a collection kit with them,
so use that for the test.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.660
Yes, Madam Jang. I will.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.270
I have to go now.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.540
Let me excuse myself.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.410
What's the first thing you want to do
as acting chairman?

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.510
I told you before.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.250
That I would find your parents' contract.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.190
Oh, come on. That's impossible.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.420
We can't just force open a locked drawer.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.090
Why not? We'll just open it.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.230
We can check it and then
just put everything back the way it was.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.660
No, you can't do that.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.700
And there's no guarantee
Chairman Min Doo Sik won't wake up.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.840
When he does, he'll check there first.
So who do you think he'll suspect?

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.380
Are you worried about me again?

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.740
But I'm more worried about you.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.680
If Chairman Min wakes up, even tomorrow,

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.880
he won't spare you, knowing who you are.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.620
You know exactly how terrifying he can be.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.520
I can't bear to see
anything happen to you.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.630
What are you smiling about?

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.430
It's nothing.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.400
I just feel so supported.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.430
Just knowing there's someone
who cares about me this much...

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.170
makes me smile.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.580
You should get going now.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.780
I'll walk the rest of the way on my own.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.780
We can't risk being seen together
by someone we know.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.250
All right, then.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520
Get home safe.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.400
This is from Madam Jang.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.440
This should be more than enough
for the test.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.050
Please let her know I'll come see her
as soon as the results are in.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.910
I will.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.320
If you run into any problems
with the test,

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.720
please contact her directly.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.130
Tae Joo? What's he doing here?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.370
If the DNA test is a match,

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.470
she said she'd consider it.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.450
If Chairman Min wakes up, even tomorrow,

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.190
he won't spare you, knowing who you are.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.920
She's right.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.630
He won't spare me
if he finds out who I am.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.600
But on the off chance...

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.630
my father's contract really is
in that desk drawer...

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.070
Excuse me.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.340
What?

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.240
What are you so deep in thought about?

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.270
It's nothing, sir.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.340
But what brings you here at this hour?

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:10.310
Remember? I said I'd sell
my Mingang stake after our talk.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.880
That's a very wise decision.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.020
Actually, this is highly confidential,

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.920
but Chairman Min Doo Sik
is in the hospital, unconscious.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.220
What? What happened?

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.290
How did that happen?

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.190
But Ja Kyung didn't say a word to me.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.400
It all happened so suddenly,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.470
and we're concerned the stock price
will plummet if word gets out.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.970
Goodness. You mean
he's not going to make it?

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.940
Thankfully, his doctor said there is hope,
and that we should just wait and see.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.850
I see.
So that's why you gave me the tip to sell.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.980
Thank you.
Who else would give me a tip like this?

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.320
I would've been completely blindsided.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.890
I'm not one to just say "thanks"
and leave it at that.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.490
I pay in cold, hard cash.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:54.090
Thanks again.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.200
Is it not enough? Here. It's 50 dollars.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Gosh.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.000
Sir, this is five dollars.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.470
The colors are similar, aren't they?

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.440
Besides, the man on this bill is
the son of the lady on the 50-dollar bill.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.610
They're from the same family.
So it's practically the same thing.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.910
What were you doing in that room again?

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.050
Just drop it.
I'm in no mood for your nonsense tonight.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.820
- I'm just feeling a bit off.
- Oh, are you now?

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.320
What's that supposed to mean?

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.090
Why is the great Oh Pan Sool
feeling so out of sorts?

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.330
Did your secret crush
finally hit the jackpot?

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.400
I'm biting my tongue to keep from
cursing you out. You hear me?

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.970
Our daughter's father-in-law was rushed
to the hospital. He's unconscious.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.300
Our in-law?

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.070
What happened?

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.340
How should I know?
You know as much as I do.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:44.410
You'd better keep your mouth shut.
If this gets out, the company is ruined,

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.680
and the stock will tank.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.650
But why haven't we heard
from Ji Seop and Ja Kyung?

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.820
They must be frantic right now, you know?

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.750
Anyway, you just never know
what life has in store.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.290
That's why they say,
"Easy come, loudly go."

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.730
It's not "Easy come, loudly go."
It's "Come empty-handed, go empty-handed."

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.900
It's close enough, right?
"Easy come, loudly go."

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.560
It's all meaningless anyway.
Life is fleeting.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.500
So don't say a word about what I do
with the Mingang stock.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.010
It's all meaningless. Life is fleeting.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.010
Mountain is mountain, and water is water.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.910
Mountains are mountains,
and water is water.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.150
And stock is stock.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.480
Mountains are mountains, water is...

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.890
Wait, what is he even talking about?

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.990
Hey! What was that about the stocks?
Oh Pan Sool!

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.400
You said this was for
a grandparentage verification test, right?

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.900
Yes. How long will it take?

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.400
The results will be available tomorrow.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:54.440
Where have you been?

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:56.280
I just had something to take care of.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.550
By the way, Manager Gong.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.050
A delivery is coming tomorrow.
Could you please get it for me?

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:03.890
Are you going somewhere?

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.460
Just in case.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.360
It might arrive when I'm not here.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.160
Is it something important?

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.730
Yes. Please get it
and keep it safe in my room.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.770
Manager Gong, did you clean my room?

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.670
I can't seem to find my hairbrush.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.210
Your hairbrush?

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.880
No. Why would I have touched it?

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.610
My toothbrush is missing too.

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.020
It must be around somewhere. Look again.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.290
Just buy new ones.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.690
- Want me to buy you some?
- No, it's fine. I have extras.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.960
By the way, I went to see Dad.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:43.430
When?

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.200
They let you see him?

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.300
Our stepmother said I could visit anytime.
Day or night, whenever I miss Dad.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:50.770
Really?

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.100
Then take me with you.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.870
I want to see how he is too.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.450
They say he can still hear us
even though he's unconscious.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.480
If there's anything you want
to say to him, you should.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.120
I have nothing to say.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:10.350
I just wanted to see for myself.

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:12.720
Let's go.

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.770
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.000
You should go home first.
I'm going to stay a little longer.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.070
There's something I need
to say to him too.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.040
- I can wait for you. Go ahead.
- No, don't.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.740
It's something private, just between us.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.180
You should head home first.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:36.710
Oh, right.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.350
Keep this a secret
from our stepmother, okay?

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.850
She won't be happy if she finds out
I tagged along with you.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.190
You know she's forbidden anyone but you
from seeing our father, right?

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:50.230
I asked the nurse to keep it quiet,
so we should be fine.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:51.700
Okay, thanks.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.560
Go on, get going.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.180
You're not actually conscious
right now, are you?

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.180
If this is another test for your children
like last time, just stop.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.580
We can see right through you, Father.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.530
It's me.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.800
I'm in my father's hospital room.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.600
My father is showing a subtle reaction.
What should I do?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Is that right?

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.510
Then that means he isn't
completely unconscious.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.580
If you can, stay there and keep an eye
on him for a bit longer.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.310
I think I'd better.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.010
If he suddenly wakes up,
it'll make things a lot more complicated.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.650
No doubt about that.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:50.790
Who's with him when he wakes up
will affect the inheritance division.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.460
And more importantly, if the chairman
were to suddenly regain consciousness,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.430
we'd have to come up with a new plan.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:56.960
That's what I was thinking too.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.730
Speaking of which,

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.600
a courier is dropping something off
at my house tomorrow morning.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.800
I need you to pick it up for me
and deliver it to Madam Jang.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.300
To Madam Jang?

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.480
(Express Delivery)

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:21.820
Excuse me.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.720
I'll take that.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.490
I was asked to accept this
on behalf of Ms. Min Kyung Chae.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.400
- Are you sure?
- If you don't believe me,

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.630
call to confirm.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.170
Okay.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.230
(Client 1, Min Se Ri,
and Client 2, Stella Jang,)

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.960
(do not have
a grandparent–grandchild relationship.)

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.140
No way.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.780
The grandparent-grandchild relationship.
That's between Madam Jang and Min Se Ri.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.780
And it's not a match?

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.780
Then that means Jung Ho Se
isn't Min Se Ri's biological father.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.820
Min Kyung Chae, you...

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.730
There was someone else besides Jung Ho Se?

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.360
Unbelievable.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:55.050
Lawyer Kim, what brings you here?

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.550
I'm here on an errand.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.620
Kyung Chae had something urgent come up,

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.480
so she asked me to deliver this for her.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.100
(Client 1, Min Se Ri,
and Client 2, Stella Jang,)

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.470
(do not have
a grandparent–grandchild relationship.)

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:35.490
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.870
