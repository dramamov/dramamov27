Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:22.337
I'm still the same Wave, your boyfriend.

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:25.108
Being your boyfriend is way better than being a prince.

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:27.533
From now on, there will be no more secret places.

00:00:27.707 --> 00:00:29.763
Let's love each other openly, so the whole island knows.

00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:32.508
I'm not going anywhere.

00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:34.576
My heart belongs here.

00:00:50.902 --> 00:00:51.988
Take care of it for me.

00:00:56.087 --> 00:00:57.338
Who were you talking to?

00:01:01.023 --> 00:01:01.945
Victor.

00:01:02.577 --> 00:01:04.568
I asked him to help me find a new piano.

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:08.957
Victor really seems to know
everything about you, huh?

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:17.294
You know you can talk to me
about anything, right?

00:01:23.094 --> 00:01:25.460
Victor and I aren't like that.

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:27.667
You don't have to worry.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.142
Besides, I know I could never be
that kind of person anyway.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.283
What kind of person? Tell me.

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:47.930
Be a prince who likes men.

00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:57.735
I'm glad you decided to tell me.

00:01:58.346 --> 00:01:59.775
It's better than keeping it all inside.

00:02:04.354 --> 00:02:06.328
But I could never tell Father and Mother.

00:02:07.614 --> 00:02:11.446
They wouldn't want an heir
who breaks tradition.

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:18.931
Honestly, the one
who should rule Arantha next is you.

00:02:20.283 --> 00:02:21.648
You're so much more capable than I am.

00:02:24.483 --> 00:02:28.966
No matter how capable I am,
a woman can't be Arantha's ruler.

00:02:29.141 --> 00:02:30.290
It's never happened before.

00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:33.552
If someone like you can't be,

00:02:34.163 --> 00:02:35.762
then how could someone like me ever be?

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:37.741
Who would accept that?

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:41.306
Even if no one else accepts it,

00:02:42.702 --> 00:02:44.588
you have to accept yourself first.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.931
This kind of matter takes time.

00:03:59.481 --> 00:04:00.261
Lava!

00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:01.539
The prince got shot?!

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:05.573
How is he now?

00:04:06.576 --> 00:04:07.425
I don't know.

00:04:07.643 --> 00:04:08.724
The doctor's still helping him.

00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:12.941
What about you? Are you hurt?

00:04:14.991 --> 00:04:15.907
I'm fine.

00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:19.302
But I'll find whoever did this.

00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:22.484
Forget that for now.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.313
Just pray he's safe.

00:04:25.836 --> 00:04:28.210
We promised them
we'd take care of him the best we could.

00:04:29.693 --> 00:04:31.438
I'll go check on the patient.

00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:36.113
Then I'll go talk to the police.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.509
Maybe they can find the shooter.

00:04:43.153 --> 00:04:44.079
Holy crap!

00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:47.397
Wave is actually a prince?!

00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:51.891
Wave— uh, I mean, the prince—

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:53.108
he'll be fine.

00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:55.800
But don't go after the gunman, okay?

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.959
It's dangerous.

00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:04.887
Lava, don't be stupid and risk your life.

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:07.410
You barely know him.

00:05:07.693 --> 00:05:10.091
The prince's business isn't your problem.

00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:11.081
Let the police handle it, okay?

00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:11.896
Listen to me.

00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:13.164
What the hell are you saying?

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.564
The person in that room
is someone I've loved for three months!

00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:20.055
I'll protect him, no matter who he is.

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:24.247
I'll make whoever hurt him pay for this.

00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:30.370
Calm down.

00:05:39.942 --> 00:05:40.835
Where is that jerk?

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:43.955
Jerk? Who are you talking about?

00:05:44.326 --> 00:05:46.098
The guy who shot Prince Davin.

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.691
You're the one
who told him he's still alive, right?

00:05:48.844 --> 00:05:49.473
Huh?!

00:05:50.018 --> 00:05:50.841
Prince who?

00:05:50.841 --> 00:05:51.512
What are you even talking about?

00:05:51.512 --> 00:05:52.308
I don't know anything!

00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:53.938
If you keep pretending to be dumb,

00:05:54.592 --> 00:05:55.782
I swear I'll stab you.

00:05:55.782 --> 00:05:56.792
I'm not kind.

00:05:56.792 --> 00:05:57.292
Hurry up!

00:05:58.164 --> 00:05:59.279
Hey, hey!

00:06:00.457 --> 00:06:01.689
Just tell him already.

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:03.367
Look at him. He's serious.

00:06:05.853 --> 00:06:07.604
Love-crazed people will do anything.

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:09.096
Tell him.

00:06:21.901 --> 00:06:22.415
Asshole!

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:23.292
Hey!

00:06:28.678 --> 00:06:29.181
Let go!

00:06:30.707 --> 00:06:31.419
That's enough!

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:32.414
Hey!

00:06:53.653 --> 00:06:54.195
Wave.

00:06:56.201 --> 00:06:56.833
Wave.

00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:03.072
Kratae called me and said you woke up,

00:07:03.072 --> 00:07:04.151
so I came right away.

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:06.409
You've been unconscious for two days.

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:07.540
I was so worried.

00:07:12.272 --> 00:07:13.368
I brought you some oranges.

00:07:13.695 --> 00:07:14.749
I even peeled them.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.990
Eat a little, okay?

00:07:31.995 --> 00:07:32.907
Who are you?

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.558
I'm Lava.

00:07:41.978 --> 00:07:42.687
Lava who?

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:46.225
I'm your boyfriend.

00:07:48.115 --> 00:07:48.884
Boyfriend?

00:07:50.955 --> 00:07:52.056
I've never had a boyfriend.

00:07:56.548 --> 00:08:00.293
My name is Davin, Prince of Arantha.

00:08:01.252 --> 00:08:02.612
So you remember now?

00:08:03.288 --> 00:08:04.528
You really don't recognize me?

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.488
I don't know you.

00:08:20.632 --> 00:08:23.350
I came to this island with my friend Victor,

00:08:24.266 --> 00:08:25.878
but he attacked me in the middle of the sea.

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:29.848
After that, I remembered nothing.

00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:35.957
Are you saying you don't remember anything from the past three months?

00:08:36.698 --> 00:08:39.912
Not even where you went,

00:08:39.912 --> 00:08:41.004
who you were with,

00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:42.202
or what happened?

00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:46.182
I don't know anything.

00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:49.393
What exactly happened?

00:08:50.767 --> 00:08:51.865
And who are all of you?

00:08:54.024 --> 00:08:55.043
How do you know me?

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.081
I think Lava should be the one
to explain that.

00:09:56.073 --> 00:09:57.563
Hello, Prince Davin.

00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:00.685
The doctor's told me everything
about your condition.

00:10:01.361 --> 00:10:02.391
Please don't be alarmed.

00:10:04.484 --> 00:10:05.487
My name is Peng.

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.319
I own Like Heaven Resort,

00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:10.173
and I'm also the village head here.

00:10:12.223 --> 00:10:13.596
I'm Lava's uncle.

00:10:14.163 --> 00:10:16.935
Uncle Peng was the one who saved your life.

00:10:18.941 --> 00:10:21.377
Thank you so much for saving me.

00:10:22.772 --> 00:10:24.116
I just gave you a place to stay.

00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:27.747
The one who really saved you was Lava.

00:10:29.753 --> 00:10:34.297
He took you to the hospital and cared for you the whole time you were here.

00:10:34.798 --> 00:10:38.490
While we wait for news from Arantha,
please rest here.

00:10:38.882 --> 00:10:41.378
I'll update you as soon as I hear anything.

00:10:41.858 --> 00:10:42.880
Thank you very much.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:00.332
Give it a try, okay?

00:11:01.248 --> 00:11:02.621
I don't even know how to help you.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.729
Did I really sleep in this room with you?

00:11:51.579 --> 00:11:52.123
Yes.

00:11:52.734 --> 00:11:53.975
We even shared the same bed.

00:12:01.323 --> 00:12:02.474
In this tiny bed?

00:12:02.757 --> 00:12:03.772
We had to squeeze in real close.

00:12:08.918 --> 00:12:09.878
Can I ask you something?

00:12:10.576 --> 00:12:11.295
Of course.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.453
You said we were dating.
How did that happen?

00:12:16.372 --> 00:12:17.424
When did it start?

00:12:19.735 --> 00:12:21.370
And how far did we go?

00:12:25.251 --> 00:12:27.724
It started after I saved your life.

00:12:28.553 --> 00:12:30.149
I brought you back here

00:12:30.803 --> 00:12:32.268
and gave you the name “Wave.”

00:12:32.922 --> 00:12:35.183
At first, I didn't even like you that much,

00:12:35.881 --> 00:12:39.853
but little by little I saw how cute you were,

00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:43.339
and then we kissed.

00:12:43.622 --> 00:12:44.301
Kissed?!

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:45.682
More than a kiss, actually.

00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:48.509
We…

00:12:49.207 --> 00:12:49.707
Huh?!

00:12:50.056 --> 00:12:51.085
We did it in this room too.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:52.893
You and I…

00:13:09.634 --> 00:13:10.689
Prince, are you okay?

00:13:18.691 --> 00:13:19.543
You know what?

00:13:21.985 --> 00:13:25.211
You were my first kiss and my first time.

00:13:30.115 --> 00:13:31.349
I'm truly honored.

00:13:33.006 --> 00:13:36.055
Hey, but I can't remember anything.

00:13:37.363 --> 00:13:38.912
I don't feel anything for you.

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:43.971
To me, you're just a stranger now.

00:13:53.455 --> 00:13:54.409
I'm sorry.

00:13:56.132 --> 00:13:56.846
It's okay.

00:13:58.045 --> 00:13:59.736
We can't undo the past anyway.

00:14:02.004 --> 00:14:03.429
Let's just say it never happened.

00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:17.367
You can sleep in this room if you want.

00:14:18.675 --> 00:14:20.096
Maybe it'll help you remember.

00:14:25.809 --> 00:14:28.276
It's fine. I don't want to trouble you.

00:14:29.475 --> 00:14:30.996
I'll stay at the resort.

00:14:31.476 --> 00:14:32.466
It's probably more convenient.

00:14:33.796 --> 00:14:34.822
Don't worry about it.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.332
This room is yours too.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:43.738
It's Wave's room, not mine.

00:15:04.355 --> 00:15:06.326
Who did you bring me to see?

00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:10.012
The one who stranded you on this island.

00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:17.135
Victor!

00:15:18.931 --> 00:15:19.850
Prince Davin!

00:15:22.524 --> 00:15:23.810
Please give me another chance.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:26.296
Another chance?

00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:28.227
You've tried to kill me twice.

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:30.643
I didn't want to.

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:32.441
It was my father's order.

00:15:34.049 --> 00:15:37.576
I actually wanted a free life like yours.

00:15:38.558 --> 00:15:41.836
I wanted to come here
to have good times with you.

00:15:42.337 --> 00:15:43.883
I wanted to bring you home.

00:15:44.823 --> 00:15:47.715
But I couldn't. My father ordered it.

00:15:49.052 --> 00:15:52.002
So please give me another chance.

00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:57.133
I'll help you and your family,

00:15:57.801 --> 00:16:00.079
and we'll forget everything
that happened on this island

00:16:00.183 --> 00:16:02.162
and start over in Arantha.

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:04.561
Don't give scum like him another chance.

00:16:14.251 --> 00:16:15.586
Aside from my sister,

00:16:18.364 --> 00:16:20.189
you're the only one I trust the most.

00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:23.906
You know all my secrets.

00:16:25.869 --> 00:16:27.077
You know all my weaknesses.

00:16:28.873 --> 00:16:33.546
But you approached me to hurt me
and my family.

00:16:39.562 --> 00:16:42.919
Was it worth it? Our friendship?

00:16:51.855 --> 00:16:56.424
Trust isn't given easily.

00:17:00.852 --> 00:17:02.342
If you break it,

00:17:04.932 --> 00:17:06.435
you'll never get it back.

00:17:14.268 --> 00:17:15.819
Lava caught you,

00:17:16.425 --> 00:17:22.171
so I'll let him decide what to do.

00:17:38.129 --> 00:17:40.116
This is our best room here.

00:17:41.662 --> 00:17:43.205
Please rest however you like, Prince.

00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:50.470
Thanks a lot.

00:17:51.326 --> 00:17:52.657
This place is nice.

00:17:53.409 --> 00:17:54.426
The atmosphere is also good.

00:17:55.805 --> 00:17:56.527
I like it.

00:18:00.537 --> 00:18:03.594
You already contacted people
in Aranta for me, right?

00:18:05.244 --> 00:18:08.211
Yes. I've spoken to them.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.386
They said they'd send someone
to pick you up soon.

00:18:13.099 --> 00:18:17.389
Paolo said your family is safe now.

00:18:20.689 --> 00:18:21.629
Thanks a lot.

00:18:22.193 --> 00:18:24.268
Just hearing that makes me happy.

00:18:26.649 --> 00:18:29.598
If you need anything, call me anytime.

00:18:35.259 --> 00:18:40.134
I'll check the AC for you
to see if it's too cool or too warm.

00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:47.611
Is the temperature okay?

00:18:49.136 --> 00:18:49.823
Yes.

00:18:55.515 --> 00:18:56.426
What about the pillow?

00:18:56.551 --> 00:18:57.883
What kind of pillow do you like?

00:18:57.883 --> 00:18:58.816
Soft or firm?

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.060
If it's too firm, I'll buy a new one for you.

00:19:02.167 --> 00:19:03.202
I can sleep like this.

00:19:05.521 --> 00:19:07.076
And the mattress —

00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:09.561
Is it too bouncy?

00:19:10.334 --> 00:19:12.843
If it's uncomfortable, I'll get you a new one.

00:19:13.846 --> 00:19:15.148
I can really sleep like this.

00:19:21.352 --> 00:19:22.197
Are you sure?

00:19:32.175 --> 00:19:36.268
If you need anything, call me.
I'm here 24/7.

00:19:38.002 --> 00:19:38.502
Mm.

00:19:55.073 --> 00:19:56.165
Ah — Prince.

00:19:56.165 --> 00:19:57.211
Thanks a lot.

00:20:10.764 --> 00:20:11.616
Hello.

00:20:11.783 --> 00:20:12.641
Hello.

00:20:13.683 --> 00:20:14.536
Doctor.

00:20:15.747 --> 00:20:16.528
What?

00:20:16.946 --> 00:20:17.953
I'm tired.

00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:19.215
You're tired already?

00:20:19.215 --> 00:20:20.515
Come here, I'll stretch you.

00:20:20.515 --> 00:20:21.015
Come on.

00:20:21.433 --> 00:20:22.207
You go ahead.

00:20:22.604 --> 00:20:23.443
I'll stretch you.

00:20:23.443 --> 00:20:24.269
Okay.

00:20:27.423 --> 00:20:28.082
It feels tight.

00:20:30.283 --> 00:20:31.618
Aren't you embarrassed in front of others?

00:20:32.642 --> 00:20:33.664
Why would I be?

00:20:33.831 --> 00:20:35.901
We're legally married.

00:20:41.499 --> 00:20:43.499
Well, poor Lava.

00:20:43.812 --> 00:20:45.005
The prince doesn't remember anything.

00:20:47.845 --> 00:20:48.524
Yeah.

00:20:49.506 --> 00:20:51.053
He has tried every possible way,

00:20:51.575 --> 00:20:54.387
but we don't know if it'll work.

00:20:55.431 --> 00:20:58.719
I think it depends on the prince
whether he wants to remember.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.076
Lava can't force him.

00:21:01.037 --> 00:21:03.282
Pushing might make him retreat.

00:21:13.329 --> 00:21:14.074
Hey.

00:21:16.142 --> 00:21:19.498
What would you do if this happened to me?

00:21:21.023 --> 00:21:22.041
Hm,

00:21:23.628 --> 00:21:24.691
that would be awful.

00:21:26.258 --> 00:21:30.631
But I'd start over and try my best
to make you love me.

00:21:32.114 --> 00:21:34.383
Pretend to be afraid of needles
so I can comfort you?

00:21:35.051 --> 00:21:36.769
That might not work.

00:21:39.672 --> 00:21:42.882
If it doesn't, I'll try other things.

00:21:43.683 --> 00:21:45.510
Today, I'll fake fear of needles.

00:21:45.949 --> 00:21:47.189
Tomorrow, I'll fake fear of blood.

00:21:47.837 --> 00:21:50.800
Next, I'll enroll in medical school

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:52.829
so we'll be at the same hospital.

00:21:55.168 --> 00:21:56.919
I'll be close to you.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.068
I'll finally make you love me.

00:22:00.676 --> 00:22:02.175
You'll go that far?

00:22:06.415 --> 00:22:08.420
If it means I get to hug you like this,

00:22:09.715 --> 00:22:11.071
it's worth any cost.

00:22:13.912 --> 00:22:16.141
Such a sweet newlywed couple, Peng.

00:22:16.642 --> 00:22:17.503
Just a little.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.688
It took us a while to go public!

00:22:20.022 --> 00:22:21.286
Let's continue running.

00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:22.557
Come here.

00:22:22.557 --> 00:22:23.389
Come.

00:22:23.493 --> 00:22:25.327
You're not old. Come on, run.

00:22:25.327 --> 00:22:26.306
I'm already old.

00:23:12.733 --> 00:23:15.850
Does everyone have to be good at drawing
in architecture school?

00:23:18.691 --> 00:23:19.785
Not really.

00:23:21.101 --> 00:23:22.674
You just need the basics,

00:23:22.987 --> 00:23:24.693
like an understanding of building structures.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.263
But I don't draw people much.

00:23:28.911 --> 00:23:29.904
You're the first I've drawn.

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:37.798
Is drawing me hard?

00:23:42.435 --> 00:23:43.268
Nope.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.481
Your eyes, nose, and mouth
have clear structures.

00:23:48.803 --> 00:23:49.823
I like your eyes.

00:23:50.053 --> 00:23:51.081
They're beautiful.

00:24:03.392 --> 00:24:04.090
What are you doing?

00:24:05.677 --> 00:24:06.930
I'm making my eyes big,

00:24:07.181 --> 00:24:08.662
so you'll draw them nicely.

00:24:12.129 --> 00:24:13.088
No need.

00:24:14.007 --> 00:24:15.556
I already remember your eyes.

00:24:16.475 --> 00:24:17.492
I've looked at them a lot.

00:24:44.092 --> 00:24:45.183
You picked flowers.

00:24:45.893 --> 00:24:47.306
Uncle Peng will scold you.

00:24:48.476 --> 00:24:49.505
It's fine.

00:24:50.153 --> 00:24:52.049
I thought you were handsome before,

00:24:52.362 --> 00:24:54.511
but now you're insanely handsome.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.197
Prince!

00:25:38.348 --> 00:25:39.108
Prince!

00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:41.834
Prince!

00:25:45.364 --> 00:25:46.546
What's going on, Lava?

00:25:47.006 --> 00:25:48.437
I heard a really loud explosion.

00:25:48.603 --> 00:25:50.114
The transformer blew again.

00:25:50.699 --> 00:25:51.806
It happens here often.

00:25:52.203 --> 00:25:53.543
This one might take a while to fix.

00:25:54.191 --> 00:25:56.159
I brought a portable fan and flashlight.

00:25:56.619 --> 00:25:59.541
The air is not that strong, but it should help.

00:26:00.293 --> 00:26:02.041
I was worried you'd be too hot to sleep.

00:26:05.529 --> 00:26:06.263
Thanks.

00:26:10.232 --> 00:26:11.652
You're not scared, right?

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.023
Do you want me to sleep here with you?

00:26:18.261 --> 00:26:19.445
I can take the floor.

00:26:21.053 --> 00:26:21.663
It's alright.

00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:23.302
I'm not scared anymore.

00:26:24.221 --> 00:26:25.191
You can go sleep.

00:26:25.901 --> 00:26:26.788
Are you sure?

00:26:28.522 --> 00:26:29.562
I can sleep.

00:26:31.567 --> 00:26:32.284
Good night.

00:26:58.862 --> 00:27:02.605
Hey, the prince really doesn't remember anything about Wave and you?

00:27:04.568 --> 00:27:05.236
That's awful.

00:27:05.716 --> 00:27:08.078
It's like none of it ever happened.

00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:14.566
Dude, don't get me wrong or anything.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:16.931
Shall we hit him over the head once more?

00:27:17.265 --> 00:27:18.771
Maybe his memory will come back.

00:27:18.771 --> 00:27:19.919
Are you insane, Tum?

00:27:20.232 --> 00:27:23.206
If you keep hitting his head,
he'll end up with permanent brain damage.

00:27:23.206 --> 00:27:24.342
How would you handle that, huh?

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.079
If you can't think of anything,
don't talk.

00:27:29.377 --> 00:27:30.692
Then what do you want me to do?

00:27:30.692 --> 00:27:31.539
That's all I could come up with.

00:27:33.858 --> 00:27:34.471
Wait.

00:27:35.139 --> 00:27:39.006
What if we try something
like a reverse method?

00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:41.036
How?

00:27:41.454 --> 00:27:47.371
Make Prince Davin go through
what Wave has felt or experienced.

00:27:47.831 --> 00:27:51.606
It might trigger certain feelings or memories.

00:27:51.606 --> 00:27:52.429
Smart!

00:27:53.807 --> 00:27:54.481
I get it now.

00:27:54.732 --> 00:27:55.232
Dude,

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.029
you need to build full 4D experiences,

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.634
covering sight, taste, smell, and sound.

00:28:02.073 --> 00:28:06.664
Make him remember
every moment he lived as Wave,

00:28:06.664 --> 00:28:08.719
and every moment he spent with you.

00:28:09.032 --> 00:28:10.886
The way you talked to Wave,

00:28:10.886 --> 00:28:12.270
the way you treated Wave —

00:28:13.586 --> 00:28:15.073
do the same with Davin.

00:28:15.345 --> 00:28:16.419
Do you think that'll work?

00:28:16.858 --> 00:28:18.130
No idea.

00:28:18.569 --> 00:28:20.617
But if you really want Wave back,

00:28:21.056 --> 00:28:22.467
you've got to try.

00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:40.209
Wake up, wake up!

00:28:40.209 --> 00:28:41.412
Get up already!

00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:43.477
What's with you?

00:28:43.768 --> 00:28:46.316
You can't make sleeping your hobby.

00:28:46.801 --> 00:28:48.050
But it's still very early.

00:28:48.865 --> 00:28:51.571
And how did you even get into my room?

00:28:52.211 --> 00:28:54.385
What about security here?

00:28:54.385 --> 00:28:59.220
People here wake up before sunrise
to earn a living.

00:28:59.531 --> 00:29:01.955
You're used to being a prince
with an easy life,

00:29:01.955 --> 00:29:04.367
but here, you've got to work

00:29:05.007 --> 00:29:08.640
to repay the effort, care,
and money I've put in!

00:29:08.815 --> 00:29:09.910
Why should I work?

00:29:11.074 --> 00:29:12.883
I can just tell Arantha to bring you money.

00:29:13.581 --> 00:29:15.299
Have you ever even tried to struggle?

00:29:15.609 --> 00:29:18.541
If you don't know hardship,
how will you ever understand your people?

00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:20.639
How could someone like you rule anyone?

00:29:20.969 --> 00:29:22.060
Don't lecture me.

00:29:22.448 --> 00:29:23.612
I know what I have to do.

00:29:24.174 --> 00:29:26.651
If you do, then get up already.

00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:27.849
Come on!

00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:28.349
Hurry up.

00:29:29.532 --> 00:29:30.372
Ugh!

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:38.292
Prince!

00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:40.085
Open the door!

00:29:41.598 --> 00:29:42.465
What now?

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.960
Something big happened.

00:29:45.511 --> 00:29:46.567
What now again?

00:29:46.858 --> 00:29:48.648
It's Arantha—

00:29:55.164 --> 00:29:56.395
What happened to Arantha?

00:29:59.246 --> 00:30:00.908
Hey, I'm showering!

00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.800
I needed to pee.

00:30:04.623 --> 00:30:06.135
So what happened to Arantha?

00:30:06.484 --> 00:30:08.064
Father and Mother are free now.

00:30:08.471 --> 00:30:10.235
Or did someone come to take me home?

00:30:10.972 --> 00:30:11.577
No.

00:30:12.566 --> 00:30:13.380
I needed to pee.

00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:16.095
And you called that something big?

00:30:28.546 --> 00:30:29.485
This is big too.

00:30:53.108 --> 00:30:54.700
Are you making me
wash your underwear too?

00:30:55.631 --> 00:30:56.603
No way.

00:30:56.894 --> 00:30:57.677
It's dirty.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:58.918
Dirty?

00:30:59.325 --> 00:31:01.136
My underwear is sexy.

00:31:01.291 --> 00:31:02.606
People want to wash it.

00:31:03.083 --> 00:31:05.095
Don't you remember when you were Wave?
You used to sneak a sniff.

00:31:05.405 --> 00:31:06.391
I did not.

00:31:06.992 --> 00:31:08.080
I'm not that kind of person.

00:31:08.526 --> 00:31:09.446
Oh really?

00:31:09.446 --> 00:31:10.259
Why would I lie?

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:12.543
Do you want me to help jog your memory?

00:31:13.067 --> 00:31:13.827
Stop it.

00:31:14.215 --> 00:31:16.432
I won't smell it, and I won't wash it either.

00:31:17.421 --> 00:31:18.911
I never had to do anything like this before.

00:31:19.221 --> 00:31:21.065
Back at the palace,
people did everything for me.

00:31:21.414 --> 00:31:24.101
My hands never even touched detergent.

00:31:27.282 --> 00:31:29.403
At the palace, you followed their rules.

00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:31.618
But here, you follow mine.

00:31:31.928 --> 00:31:32.984
Don't resist.

00:31:34.148 --> 00:31:36.267
Or did you forget
what happens when you resist?

00:31:47.766 --> 00:31:48.609
Ouch!

00:31:49.617 --> 00:31:51.684
Don't abuse your power.

00:31:53.061 --> 00:31:54.433
My balls!

00:31:58.661 --> 00:32:00.385
I bet he's starting to remember something.

00:32:05.117 --> 00:32:09.146
Ugh, barnacles won't come off
that easily!

00:32:11.531 --> 00:32:13.180
Why do I have to do this anyway?

00:32:13.723 --> 00:32:14.739
You've never heard of this saying?

00:32:15.204 --> 00:32:18.116
“When you live under someone's roof,
you lend a hand.”

00:32:18.116 --> 00:32:19.680
“So help us scrape off the barnacles.”

00:32:21.173 --> 00:32:21.717
What are you talking about?

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:25.818
Hey, you were way stronger
when you were Wave.

00:32:25.993 --> 00:32:27.823
Why so weak now that you're a prince?

00:32:37.073 --> 00:32:38.679
I don't like being called weak.

00:32:41.685 --> 00:32:42.814
Fine, Your Highness.

00:32:42.814 --> 00:32:47.584
Then show me your strength, please!

00:33:00.403 --> 00:33:01.730
Harder, Your Highness!

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:02.984
Harder! That's not enough!

00:33:04.031 --> 00:33:06.086
It's a giant one. Crack it!

00:33:07.327 --> 00:33:07.943
Harder!

00:33:07.943 --> 00:33:09.231
Come on, keep going.

00:33:11.422 --> 00:33:12.186
No way.

00:33:12.904 --> 00:33:14.561
I'd never like someone like you.

00:33:14.561 --> 00:33:15.634
You're rude!

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.236
Teacher Wave,

00:33:30.236 --> 00:33:32.473
I got accepted into the provincial school,

00:33:32.686 --> 00:33:35.096
and I got a musician's scholarship too,

00:33:35.561 --> 00:33:38.199
thanks to the song you taught me.

00:33:40.798 --> 00:33:42.114
I taught you?

00:33:42.347 --> 00:33:44.614
Yeah! You taught me for a whole month.

00:33:44.866 --> 00:33:46.559
Are you kidding me now?

00:33:46.986 --> 00:33:50.026
Well, Wave's been sick,

00:33:50.026 --> 00:33:52.330
so he's a bit forgetful.

00:33:52.718 --> 00:33:58.982
Aomsin, remind him
how good a teacher he is.

00:34:00.184 --> 00:34:03.390
You're smart, kind,
and really patient with me.

00:34:04.224 --> 00:34:05.810
I almost gave up,

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.117
but you kept encouraging me.

00:34:09.083 --> 00:34:11.211
And best of all…

00:34:11.211 --> 00:34:13.306
It was free of charge.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.123
If it weren't for you,

00:34:16.899 --> 00:34:19.630
I would've made him quit learning piano.

00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:23.725
Amazing!

00:34:25.102 --> 00:34:25.829
See?

00:34:26.488 --> 00:34:29.969
Teacher Wave could change
the kid's world this much.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:37.159
Who knows, maybe one day
he'll be a world-class musician,

00:34:37.314 --> 00:34:40.424
playing at Kentucky Hall, New York City!

00:34:41.588 --> 00:34:42.432
Wait.

00:34:43.111 --> 00:34:44.859
It's Carnegie Hall, isn't it?

00:34:45.596 --> 00:34:46.672
Same thing.

00:34:47.971 --> 00:34:49.027
Come on. Let's hug.

00:35:11.662 --> 00:35:13.110
Why did you bring me down here?

00:35:13.731 --> 00:35:14.671
Aren't you scared the tide will rise?

00:35:16.009 --> 00:35:17.536
The tide's low right now.

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:18.849
It's really beautiful.

00:35:29.602 --> 00:35:30.220
It's beautiful.

00:35:35.262 --> 00:35:36.128
Look.

00:35:37.253 --> 00:35:39.631
When the water goes down,
trash's everywhere.

00:35:41.027 --> 00:35:42.527
I wonder where it all floated from.

00:35:43.788 --> 00:35:44.969
Someone should clean it up.

00:35:46.714 --> 00:35:47.410
They do.

00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:51.141
Uncle Peng and the villagers
usually help out.

00:35:53.953 --> 00:35:57.083
So you brought me here to pick up trash?

00:35:58.770 --> 00:35:59.466
Let's do it.

00:36:00.048 --> 00:36:00.812
No.

00:36:02.344 --> 00:36:04.268
I brought you

00:36:05.432 --> 00:36:07.342
because this place is special to us.

00:36:10.154 --> 00:36:10.779
Special?

00:36:12.854 --> 00:36:13.524
How?

00:36:16.103 --> 00:36:18.039
It's where…

00:36:19.571 --> 00:36:20.301
we kissed.

00:36:28.882 --> 00:36:32.099
And Wave was the one
who asked to kiss me.

00:36:35.473 --> 00:36:36.293
He did?

00:36:37.204 --> 00:36:37.753
Yeah.

00:36:39.363 --> 00:36:40.223
I loved that moment.

00:36:41.154 --> 00:36:42.129
Wave was so brave,

00:36:45.814 --> 00:36:49.623
and it was the first time I realized
I was starting to really like Wave.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.098
I brought you here,

00:36:55.037 --> 00:37:00.338
hoping it might help you
recall some feelings.

00:37:21.187 --> 00:37:24.658
I don't know what Wave felt for you,

00:37:27.897 --> 00:37:28.961
but I'm Davin.

00:37:31.657 --> 00:37:33.171
I don't kiss someone I don't love.

00:37:43.525 --> 00:37:44.512
I understand.

00:37:47.402 --> 00:37:48.136
I'm sorry.

00:37:51.413 --> 00:37:52.314
Don't be.

00:37:54.525 --> 00:37:56.075
I know you're trying,

00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:01.790
but I really can't be Wave for you.

00:38:05.262 --> 00:38:06.716
It's all in the past now.

00:38:08.927 --> 00:38:10.521
You should focus on the present.

00:38:40.697 --> 00:38:41.802
Let it go, man.

00:38:42.558 --> 00:38:44.358
You've done your best.

00:38:45.328 --> 00:38:45.919
Yeah,

00:38:47.296 --> 00:38:52.360
Lava, it's crazy enough
this even happened at all.

00:38:54.241 --> 00:38:55.563
Still, it's a regret, huh?

00:38:56.126 --> 00:38:59.711
If he did remember, that'd be so sweet.

00:39:01.049 --> 00:39:03.083
Remember that time His High— uh…

00:39:04.266 --> 00:39:05.280
whatever we call him—

00:39:05.747 --> 00:39:11.369
got high here at my bar
and ran around like crazy?

00:39:11.524 --> 00:39:13.308
If his royal guards knew,

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.673
we'd both be dead, Tum!

00:39:15.673 --> 00:39:16.829
You're right!

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:22.191
Good thing he forgot, or I'd be screwed.

00:39:23.975 --> 00:39:25.659
But I've got a video of the prince
when he was high.

00:39:25.756 --> 00:39:26.385
Do you want to see it?

00:39:27.413 --> 00:39:28.277
Let me find it.

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:29.892
Here we go.

00:39:44.768 --> 00:39:46.128
You've got more videos of him?

00:39:47.427 --> 00:39:48.666
Oh, tons.

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:50.327
I filmed them for content.

00:39:57.949 --> 00:39:58.568
Hey!

00:39:58.568 --> 00:39:59.271
Hey!?

00:39:59.367 --> 00:40:01.392
Hey, that's enough, Tum.

00:40:01.392 --> 00:40:02.501
Honey, stop it.

00:40:02.908 --> 00:40:03.668
Something good again, huh?

00:40:03.668 --> 00:40:04.215
Tum!

00:40:05.824 --> 00:40:06.431
Help me with something.

00:40:11.216 --> 00:40:12.432
Please have a seat, Your Highness.

00:40:17.601 --> 00:40:18.661
What's going on?

00:40:20.071 --> 00:40:21.501
We brought you here to watch a movie.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.188
What movie?

00:40:24.527 --> 00:40:25.865
It's a surprise.

00:40:27.562 --> 00:40:30.970
And this is for a better
viewing experience, Your Highness.

00:40:34.155 --> 00:40:39.139
This movie is directed
and shot by Tum himself.

00:40:39.765 --> 00:40:43.225
Like Heaven Studio proudly presents

00:40:43.669 --> 00:40:47.028
Lava and the Prince!

00:40:47.263 --> 00:40:52.959
Ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da, ta-da-da!

00:40:55.883 --> 00:40:58.661
Thai voices by… himself.

00:41:06.127 --> 00:41:07.858
Your highness, I bow to you.

00:41:08.693 --> 00:41:12.953
I don't really know the proper words to use when speaking to you,

00:41:13.475 --> 00:41:17.244
but I'll just talk the way I usually do.

00:41:18.889 --> 00:41:23.562
I'm Lava Tiwakorn Rapeepong.

00:41:24.293 --> 00:41:26.517
My mom sent me to this island
to fix my behavior,

00:41:27.222 --> 00:41:28.963
to live with Uncle Peng.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.966
Back then, I wanted to go home every day

00:41:33.167 --> 00:41:36.853
until I met the person who made my time here the happiest it's ever been.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.258
When I took you to the beach
where I first found you,

00:41:41.258 --> 00:41:43.117
and demonstrated how I saved you,

00:41:43.117 --> 00:41:45.149
I was still annoyed by you.

00:41:45.567 --> 00:41:47.368
But not anymore now.

00:41:48.908 --> 00:41:50.799
Hey, stop it already.

00:41:51.765 --> 00:41:53.023
Don't worry.

00:41:53.258 --> 00:41:57.339
No one wants you to remember
more than I do.

00:41:58.194 --> 00:41:58.890
Get up.

00:41:59.464 --> 00:42:01.339
This one is the cutest.

00:42:01.339 --> 00:42:04.818
That night, you were high on weed
and freaked out, running away too.

00:42:04.818 --> 00:42:06.086
All because of Tum!

00:42:10.132 --> 00:42:12.721
Welcome to Honey Bar!

00:42:12.721 --> 00:42:14.523
Hi everyone.

00:42:14.523 --> 00:42:17.503
Today, I'm fixing the noodle shop
with my friends.

00:42:17.503 --> 00:42:20.926
Let's see the before and after.

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.701
Tum secretly filmed us
when we were fixing it.

00:42:25.701 --> 00:42:27.982
You wiped my sweat and handed me a drink.

00:42:27.982 --> 00:42:29.954
That was when I started liking you.

00:42:33.008 --> 00:42:33.900
Thanks.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.369
We rode to the beach with Tum and Kratae.

00:42:37.369 --> 00:42:39.209
I drove fast
and teasingly hit the brakes all of a sudden.

00:42:39.209 --> 00:42:41.212
You grabbed my waist tight.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.738
We ate roast pork noodles
in front of the temple.

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:46.710
You loved extra roast pork.

00:42:51.383 --> 00:42:54.321
Back then, Tum and Kratae were teasing us for secretly dating.

00:42:55.887 --> 00:42:58.593
Gotcha!

00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:59.532
Hey!

00:43:00.733 --> 00:43:05.095
During the election,
Kratae filmed your campaign speech for Uncle Peng.

00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:06.829
I was super happy.

00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:09.516
Thanks to you,
Uncle Peng won as village head.

00:43:11.082 --> 00:43:15.737
So please, give Uncle Peng the chance
to give this island a new life

00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:20.323
like he gave me mine.

00:43:20.584 --> 00:43:26.823
Yay! Vote! Vote!

00:43:27.476 --> 00:43:36.188
Vote! Vote!

00:43:36.188 --> 00:43:37.943
These are just the moments Tum recorded.

00:43:37.943 --> 00:43:40.410
There are so many more memories
on this island.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:42.228
I just don't want you to forget me,

00:43:43.246 --> 00:43:45.384
Lava Tiwakorn Rapeepong.

00:43:47.864 --> 00:43:50.684
Now you understand
why I never wanted to go back home, right?

00:43:52.929 --> 00:43:57.735
It's because Wave made me want to be
an island boy forever.

00:44:07.472 --> 00:44:09.704
See you at Nava Mahasamut.

00:44:10.403 --> 00:44:11.659
All done, Tum.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:13.855
If he still doesn't remember, just let him go.

00:44:18.945 --> 00:44:20.656
What is “Nava Mahasamut”?

00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:22.901
No idea.

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:25.395
Maybe it's a secret code
between you and Lava.

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:29.568
And where is he now?

00:44:31.239 --> 00:44:32.571
I really don't know.

00:44:32.884 --> 00:44:34.305
You have to find him.

00:44:50.437 --> 00:44:51.926
(Nava Mahasamut.)

00:45:01.037 --> 00:45:03.081
Aww, look at those sleepy eyes!

00:45:03.081 --> 00:45:04.541
Look at those sleepy eyes.

00:45:04.541 --> 00:45:05.733
My baby girl.

00:45:08.135 --> 00:45:10.180
Your Highness, my respects.

00:45:10.519 --> 00:45:13.139
Dao, you don't have to do that.

00:45:13.426 --> 00:45:16.012
The Prince won't mind, right?

00:45:19.301 --> 00:45:20.556
No need to bow.

00:45:21.444 --> 00:45:22.624
Just act normal.

00:45:23.981 --> 00:45:27.417
Do you remember me, Your Highness?

00:45:27.965 --> 00:45:29.634
I'm Dao, the housekeeper here.

00:45:29.634 --> 00:45:31.966
I taught you the Southern dialect once.
Do you remember?

00:45:36.325 --> 00:45:37.789
And this is my daughter.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.837
You were there when she was born.

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:41.967
When my water broke!
Do you remember?

00:45:50.451 --> 00:45:53.167
Come here, sweet girl.

00:45:55.151 --> 00:45:56.889
Come see the Prince.

00:46:08.333 --> 00:46:10.808
Let the Prince hold you.

00:46:29.834 --> 00:46:32.024
Come on, come on. I'll carry her now.

00:46:36.827 --> 00:46:37.838
Hi there.

00:46:38.882 --> 00:46:41.925
Can I play with you? Peek-a-boo!

00:46:43.439 --> 00:46:44.533
Peek-a-boo!

00:46:51.006 --> 00:46:52.294
Chief.

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:57.451
Well, I wanted to ask.

00:46:57.451 --> 00:47:04.430
Can you and Dr. Wut
adopt my daughter as your own?

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:06.576
Dao, why?

00:47:07.072 --> 00:47:08.316
Where is her real father?

00:47:10.248 --> 00:47:13.710
I don't know where he is, and I don't care.

00:47:14.206 --> 00:47:15.727
I only care about my child.

00:47:16.092 --> 00:47:18.164
I'm scared I can't raise her well on my own.

00:47:18.295 --> 00:47:21.090
I want her to be in the care
of someone capable,

00:47:23.126 --> 00:47:31.990
so I think you both could be my child's dads and secure her future.

00:47:37.133 --> 00:47:38.921
I don't know about that, Dao.

00:47:39.547 --> 00:47:41.032
You have to ask Dr. Wut.

00:47:49.542 --> 00:47:51.029
I'm fine with that.

00:47:53.561 --> 00:47:55.433
We're legally married now.

00:47:57.626 --> 00:48:01.206
If another child joins the family, I'm ready.

00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:03.001
Right?

00:48:03.001 --> 00:48:04.949
Are you ready? Are you?

00:48:04.949 --> 00:48:05.665
Alright.

00:48:06.526 --> 00:48:08.415
Let's go file the papers at the district office.

00:48:10.403 --> 00:48:14.019
Chief, thank you so much!

00:48:14.019 --> 00:48:15.559
Thank you, Dr. Wut.

00:48:16.681 --> 00:48:18.698
I haven't even named her yet.

00:48:18.907 --> 00:48:21.554
I told you, Chief, you should name her.

00:48:21.789 --> 00:48:24.004
Let me and Dr.Wut think about it first.

00:48:24.422 --> 00:48:27.625
Or maybe the Prince
would like to name her?

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:35.447
No, I'm an outsider.

00:48:36.126 --> 00:48:37.212
You should name her yourselves.

00:48:39.483 --> 00:48:40.971
You're not an outsider.

00:48:41.519 --> 00:48:43.278
You're also part of our family.

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:51.068
You're such a chubby little girl.

00:48:51.068 --> 00:48:52.983
How lucky you are, my daughter.

00:48:53.479 --> 00:48:55.746
By the way, where is Lava?

00:48:56.738 --> 00:48:58.371
I want to ask him about that name.

00:48:58.684 --> 00:49:01.007
He's in his room, probably sleeping.

00:49:05.784 --> 00:49:07.278
Come on. I'll carry her.

00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:11.602
Come, sweetheart.

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:16.823
Do you like it?

00:49:23.949 --> 00:49:24.723
Lava.

00:49:29.422 --> 00:49:30.230
Lava.

00:49:31.692 --> 00:49:33.350
I really don't know where that place is.

00:49:38.154 --> 00:49:39.251
Lava, are you in there?

00:49:41.522 --> 00:49:42.668
I'm coming in.

00:52:24.778 --> 00:52:25.940
I like your eyes.

00:52:26.123 --> 00:52:27.491
They're beautiful.

00:52:29.083 --> 00:52:31.585
But I don't draw people much.

00:52:31.898 --> 00:52:33.349
You're the first I've drawn.

00:52:43.417 --> 00:52:46.506
NAVA MAHASAMUT

00:52:48.647 --> 00:52:50.632
See you at Nava Mahasamut.

00:52:51.911 --> 00:52:54.207
You said you wanted a real name, right?

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:57.429
I found one with a nice meaning.

00:52:57.429 --> 00:52:58.489
NAVA MAHASAMUT

00:54:03.387 --> 00:54:05.039
Ah! That tickles!

00:54:30.919 --> 00:54:31.681
Mr. Peng!

00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:33.704
Oh…

00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:37.985
Calm down, Your Highness.

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:39.192
Is something wrong?

00:54:40.654 --> 00:54:41.993
I need your help.

00:55:41.502 --> 00:55:42.620
Why are you leaving so fast?

00:55:46.953 --> 00:55:48.069
You're not waiting for me anymore?

00:56:06.132 --> 00:56:07.489
Your secret code—

00:56:08.821 --> 00:56:10.050
it took time, you know.

00:56:12.452 --> 00:56:13.690
How did you even get here?

00:56:14.943 --> 00:56:15.726
Did you remember everything?

00:56:17.945 --> 00:56:18.707
Not yet.

00:56:22.403 --> 00:56:26.737
Just bits and pieces. It's still blurry.

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:34.531
It's okay.

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:38.074
I've done my best.

00:56:38.883 --> 00:56:43.808
Just the fact that you remember this island makes me happy enough.

00:56:45.844 --> 00:56:47.633
From what you've shown me,

00:56:48.964 --> 00:56:54.912
Lava and Wave must have shared
so many good memories together, right?

00:56:57.705 --> 00:57:02.528
It's a shame I'm the only one
who remembers them.

00:57:07.253 --> 00:57:09.314
I once said I envied Wave

00:57:11.898 --> 00:57:14.419
because he got to restart
his memories from zero.

00:57:16.403 --> 00:57:19.671
But not anymore.

00:57:21.263 --> 00:57:23.461
Now I want to remember
everything about us forever.

00:57:26.672 --> 00:57:27.910
I'm still trying.

00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:30.517
Just give me a little more time.

00:57:33.519 --> 00:57:35.003
Do I even have any left?

00:57:41.425 --> 00:57:42.381
It's fine.

00:57:43.164 --> 00:57:45.301
Even if I only have one day,

00:57:46.032 --> 00:57:48.774
one hour, or one minute left,

00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:53.043
I'll make you remember
what happened between us.

00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:02.866
Can I try something?

00:59:24.117 --> 00:59:25.335
It's a lot clearer now.

00:59:38.091 --> 00:59:38.985
Do you want a bite?

01:00:22.943 --> 01:00:24.000
Anya!

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:30.258
If tonight is the last night we get to be together,

01:00:30.258 --> 01:00:32.643
can we make it a night we'll remember forever?

01:00:32.643 --> 01:00:35.593
What if I go to the palace to see you?

01:00:37.707 --> 01:00:41.321
What happened between us would just be a summer memory.

01:00:41.321 --> 01:00:42.963
Wave has nothing to lose.

01:00:42.963 --> 01:00:44.070
He has no past to hold on to.

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:45.923
All his life, it's just you!
