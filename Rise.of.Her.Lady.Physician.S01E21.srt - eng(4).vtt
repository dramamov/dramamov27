=How About Marrying Me?=

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.280
Rong Zelan,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.520
tell me,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.720
what was the cause of
the obstructed labor?

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.200
Besides,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.680
how did you manage
to deliver my grandson?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.560
Your Majesty,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.720
the Princess Consort
had obstructed labor

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.840
because the mischievous baby

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.480
grabbed the umbilical cord.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.680
I found the root of the problem

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.920
and applied acupuncture,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.480
using a needle to prick his hand.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.120
He felt pain

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.880
and released the umbilical cord.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.760
Then he was naturally born.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.880
Do you mean

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.240
the Princess Consort's death
was an illusion?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.960
That's right.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.120
Her Highness didn't really die

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.920
but exhausted her energy

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.520
due to obstructed labor,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.360
thus falling into a state of
suspended animation, similar to death.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.040
Normally,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.520
any physician with even
a little experience

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.360
would be able to detect

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.800
that Her Highness was not truly dead.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.560
I'm very curious.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.720
How could the skilled vice minister
of the Imperial Medical Bureau

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.760
be so certain

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.920
that Her Highness had already died?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.080
Feng Mingyuan,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.720
did you truly not discover
her state of suspended animation?

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.640
Your Majesty!

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.080
My skills are inadequate.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.320
Please punish me!

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.440
But please discern the truth.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.440
The premature delivery

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.200
was all because of the decoction
prescribed by Rong Zelan.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.720
I think

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.800
she deliberately drugged the medicine

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.620
in an attempt to harm the heir.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.920
We must expel

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.620
such a vicious woman!

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.120
Lord Feng, this is so ridiculous.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.440
If I had intended to harm Her Highness,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.280
why would I have risked my life

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.000
to save Her Highness and her child?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.000
That's why it was a brilliant move.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.370
She used poison

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.920
to cause the premature delivery

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.920
and then took the opportunity

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.680
to save them both,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.520
earning not only
a good name for saving lives

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.560
but also a chance to be promoted.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.440
What a cunning scheme.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.960
Lord Feng, I really admire you for making

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.360
baseless consumptions.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.200
Are you just stating

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.840
your own plan?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.760
- Nonsense!
- Your Majesty,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.120
the prescriptions can still be found,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.200
and they can prove

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.280
that she made no mistakes.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.520
However, Lord Feng

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.680
is just making things up

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.640
and can't be trusted.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.880
About the conduct of Attendant Rong,

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.320
I've seen it clearly

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.040
these days

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.160
during the recuperation.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.360
Though seriously injured,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.320
she still risked her life to save

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.840
the Princess Consort and her child.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.840
However, someone

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.080
had no intention of saving others

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.840
but kept trying
to condemn Attendant Rong.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.100
What is he really up to?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.080
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.920
I'm innocent!

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.880
I admit my limitations in medicine!

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.640
As for

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.280
whether Attendant Rong intended

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.720
to harm Her Highness and her child,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.160
please investigate it clearly!

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.000
Rong Zelan,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.480
I'll give you ten days

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.720
to find out the truth.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.080
If you can't

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.840
prove your innocence,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.080
I'll punish you

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.200
according to the law.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.600
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.760
Your Majesty,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.280
if I can prove my innocence,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.080
may I boldly ask you for a reward?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.320
You saved the Princess Consort
and my grandson.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.600
You should be rewarded.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.320
What do you want?

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.320
I want permission.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.400
I wish that from now on,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.520
I can treat patients
and make prescriptions

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.880
legally as a woman.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.200
Your Majesty.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.760
There are many women in the palace,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.600
and sometimes it's hard to

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.080
tell our conditions to male physicians.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.760
In the past, when receiving treatment,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.200
the consorts had to be
separated by a screen,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.080
which was inconvenient.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.040
If there's a female physician,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.840
she can not only avoid embarrassment

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.910
but also

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.120
take better care of our health.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.640
Wouldn't that be

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.640
perfect for all?

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.760
Mother,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.720
you have a point.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.760
Rong Zelan,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.960
if you can prove your innocence

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.440
and your ability,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.800
I'll certainly consider it.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.360
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.600
Attendant Rong,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.400
it's midnight.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.680
Why are you still up?

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.720
Is the wound hurting again?

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.800
The Princess Consort's
premature delivery

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.960
is full of doubts.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.840
His Majesty only gave me ten days.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.040
I'm trying

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.240
to figure out the real cause.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.960
Feng Mingyuan is highly skilled.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.760
If he intended to harm someone,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.720
it wouldn't be easy to detect.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.360
But Minister Wu

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.080
reviewed the prescription
and found no mistakes,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.480
and I selected the ingredients
carefully myself.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.440
Nothing could go wrong.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.480
Even the utensils
were repeatedly inspected.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.200
Every day after making the decoction,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.480
I always used

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.040
a silver needle to test its toxicity

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.640
and then tasted it myself,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.480
no poison at all.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.560
So, what could

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.840
possibly go wrong?

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.880
If not the decoction,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.440
could it be

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.080
because of Her Highness's
health condition?

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.320
I once read it in a book

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.000
that if a pregnant woman

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.240
becomes agitated,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.800
it can also disturb the womb.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.360
In the palace,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.560
things are complicated,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.840
so emotional fluctuations
are inevitable.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.180
Tomorrow, I'll request
for a consultation

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.320
to figure it out.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.040
In addition,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.280
the imperial cuisine
is handled by many people.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.680
Ingredient preparation

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.680
and cooking process

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.160
must be thoroughly investigated.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.040
We'll definitely uncover the truth.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.960
Zelan.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.480
The truth is certainly important,

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.680
but so is

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.640
your life.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.560
What's wrong?

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.680
What do you mean?

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.520
Your Highness, thank you
for risking your life to save me.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.120
Had it not been for you,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.920
I would've lost my life.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.160
Besides, you've helped me so many times.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.960
I'm deeply grateful.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.000
If there's anything
I can do in the future,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.560
please feel free to ask me.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.960
That's right.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.040
Well,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.280
I saved your life.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.920
How can you repay it?

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.760
How about...

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.960
marrying me?

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.760
I really appreciate your help.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.640
However, as for saving my life,

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.800
I should be more grateful

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.520
to myself.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.280
If I hadn't been skilled enough,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.760
even with your help and sacrifice,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.360
I would still

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.600
have been dead.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.600
Indeed.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.240
Attendant Rong,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.520
you're so erudite

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.540
and brave.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.400
I really

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.120
admire you.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.240
Your Highness,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.080
the delivery has exhausted your body.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.920
Here's another prescription

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.960
for your recuperation.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.160
Okay.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.720
How's your injury?

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.040
Thanks for your concern, Your Highness.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.380
I've used medicine.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.240
I'm fine now.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.840
About your premature delivery,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.300
I have a few questions.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.800
I wonder if you could answer me.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.240
Go ahead.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.160
Before the premature delivery,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.880
was there anything
that made you particularly angry,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:54.880
sad,

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.320
or upset?

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.120
Those few days,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.880
although I had to deal with
complex affairs,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.680
I didn't face anything
particularly distressing.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.800
My mood was quite stable.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.800
What about your diet?

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.160
Attendant Rong,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.720
we checked

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.760
every meal of Her Highness,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.760
nothing unusual.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:19.880
We've also kept samples.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.000
Do you need to check them again?

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.280
Yes, please get them.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.760
Attendant Rong,

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.840
this is the meal from yesterday.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.640
Is anything wrong?

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.000
No.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.680
(Nothing's wrong with her mood or diet.)

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.360
(The cause)

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.200
(still lies in the decoction.)

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.320
(However, the ingredients were correct,)

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.040
(and the silver needle found no poison.)

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.800
(What am I missing?)
