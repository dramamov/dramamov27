=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.900
=Episode 15=

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.399
Come on,
let me make a toast to everyone.

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:23.240
Come on, cheers!

00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:24.750
Ever since I got back from the UK,

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.520
you've all been looking out for me.

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.119
I've been freeloading off you guys.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.360
But now, I've finally got a job.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.479
Thank you, everyone.

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.919
Oh, you're too polite.

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:33.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.839
Our class goddess is
back and working again.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.915
It's like she's playing
on a different level.

00:01:37.982 --> 00:01:39.440
It's an honor for Nanzhou.

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:40.160
Right?

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.839
Exactly.

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.640
Here's to Meiqi stepping
into a new chapter in life.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.715
May success follow you!

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.240
That's right, success all the way!

00:01:50.248 --> 00:01:52.190
We should stick with you
and let you buy us

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:53.360
fancy dinners every day!

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.520
Deal!

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:56.559
Come on, try this!

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.199
Our restaurant's Wellington steak

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:59.080
is totally authentic.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.360
Top-grade filet.

00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:01.604
Foie gras and mushrooms,

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:03.310
all wrapped up in layers of Spanish ham.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:04.600
Sixty-four layers of puff pastry.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800
Each layer adds more flavor.
It's amazing.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.240
Dig in!

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.320
Come on, try it.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.960
So good.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.240
I never used to eat Western food before.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.800
Because you're such a country bumpkin.

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:19.520
Another unforgettable memory

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.760
added to my life story.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.360
Bichen,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.040
you should hold
your wedding at our hotel.

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.520
We have a super high-end banquet hall.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.559
Seven meters tall with a domed ceiling.

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:30.719
The chandelier's light

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:31.999
is simply magical.

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:32.760
Let me show you.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.279
It's absolutely stunning.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:37.320
Look.

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.480
Gorgeous.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.240
Beautiful.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.399
Honestly, wedding banquets
at upscale hotels

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.080
aren't as out of reach
as everyone thinks.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.040
They offer a variety of package options.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.839
Check this out.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.640
They even have a bridal package.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.920
Booking starts at just 12 tables.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.640
They throw in a luxury suite
and floral arrangements,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.159
so it's great value.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.830
I'm tempted just looking at it.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.493
I'd get married right now if I could.

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:07.439
Then hurry up and find someone.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.999
I can't find anyone.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.159
I feel like getting married too.

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.240
Hu Gang, introduce me to someone.

00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:16.270
Where am I supposed
to find one for you?

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:17.839
I don't even have anyone myself.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.920
I'll send it to you.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.960
If you'd like to book it,

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:23.390
I'll get you a rock-bottom price.

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:24.080
Okay, okay.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.240
I'll go home and go over it

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.520
with my boyfriend.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.559
An amazing dinner.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.389
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.670
- Delicious.
- I'm so glad today.

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:31.679
Thanks to you.

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:32.480
Not at all.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:33.760
Let's hang out again.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.760
- Let's meet for the holidays.
- See you next time.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.159
Bye.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.320
- Okay.
- Take care, bye.

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:37.240
Bye.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.240
- Bye.
- Bye-bye!

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:44.960
Hello, Mom.

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:48.520
It just ended.

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:53.320
Stop staring.

00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:55.448
I can see the sparkles in your eyes.

00:03:57.582 --> 00:03:59.093
You've always liked Meiqi, right?

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.719
How did you know that?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.559
Please, the whole class knew.

00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:05.800
Remember the mock
exam camp in senior year?

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.839
After evening self-study,

00:04:06.848 --> 00:04:08.590
the road outside the school
was pitch-dark.

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:09.839
Meiqi was scared,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.679
so you went and tinkered up

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:12.920
a solar-powered street lamp.

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:17.120
That was just to make it
convenient for everyone.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.315
For everyone's convenience, huh?

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.239
The moment Meiqi went abroad,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.137
that streetlight stopped working.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:27.159
That must've been
because of the heavy rain.

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.239
More like a storm in your heart.

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:36.640
Now that Meiqi's back,

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.039
seize your chance.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.320
You can do it.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.239
What's up?

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.760
- Nothing.
- Nothing important.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:47.839
Didn't you have some drinks?

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:48.960
You shouldn't be driving.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.640
It's fine. I can call a driver.

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:52.909
Here's a guy who didn't drink.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.071
Let him take you home.

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.239
Sorry to trouble you.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.960
No, no trouble at all.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.520
Alright then, take my car.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.799
The gray one over there.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.799
I...

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.239
I don't know how to drive.

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.919
You...

00:05:10.137 --> 00:05:12.080
How exactly are you
going to get her home?

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.880
I have...

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.359
I...

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:16.799
I have an electric scooter.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.320
And also, I've got...

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.479
I've got...

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:20.640
A Didi ride coupon!

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.399
I'll find it. Hang on.

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.440
No wonder
you still don't have a girlfriend.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.560
What?

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.360
Because I don't
have a driver's license?

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.640
Look at him.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.760
Chen!

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:35.239
Zhidong!

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:36.200
Over here!

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.080
Mr. Hu?

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.349
Mr. Hu.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.071
Long time no see.

00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:40.915
It's been a while.

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:42.399
We'll get going then.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.159
Meiqi's in your care.

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:47.320
Princess, your carriage awaits.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.960
Let's go.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.359
Why didn't you ride your bike today?

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.799
Well, you had some drinks,

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:54.159
so we'll take a cab.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.799
I'll call a premium ride tonight.

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.399
I've never been on an e-scooter.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.399
The breeze feels so nice.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.359
Yeah?

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.120
If you want,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.960
I can take you every day.

00:06:20.226 --> 00:06:21.640
Your school is in the old town.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.869
I live in the new district.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.582
That's really far.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.880
So what?

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.200
We'll just leave earlier.

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.159
Look, that's Nanzhou University.

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:39.960
(Nanzhou University)

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.239
Look, that's Nanzhou University.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.960
Last year,
seven of my students got in here.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.080
Wow, that's impressive.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.839
Hu Gang.

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:53.120
You had such good grades back then.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.626
Why did you go to a normal school?

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:58.520
I'm not like you.

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:00.440
You've seen a lot since you were little.

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:02.359
As for me,

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:04.440
I've only ever been to Thailand,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.160
and that was with a tour group.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.839
All I knew growing up was
how to study and take exams.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.000
Well, I actually enjoy doing exercises.

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.120
When it came time to pick a major,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.799
I only picked education schools.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.360
After I graduated from college,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.599
I decided to go back
and teach at Nanzhou High School.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.159
Everything there just felt so familiar.

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:29.760
Even the volume of the class bells was

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.520
the same as before.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.440
That's nice.

00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:34.790
You are shaping young minds

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:36.560
as a great teacher.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.760
There's just one downside.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.320
My students drive me crazy.

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:42.200
I've developed nodules all over.

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.479
One day it's a lung nodule,

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:46.039
the next it's a thyroid one.

00:07:46.093 --> 00:07:48.030
Not a single one of them
gives me peace of mind.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.648
They're more mischievous than we were.

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:54.120
It's getting chilly.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.000
Let's head back.

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:04.799
Here, put this on.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.479
Fits pretty well.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.640
Keeping warm in the cold.

00:08:10.719 --> 00:08:11.719
This is easy.

00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:13.279
Come on.

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:13.919
Let's go.

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:17.560
Sis.

00:08:18.239 --> 00:08:19.589
You can't always wait for me

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.819
to come downstairs with you.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.300
You need to move around more yourself.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.537
Otherwise, how can you
keep up with your grandson?

00:08:26.359 --> 00:08:27.680
I just get scared sometimes.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:30.839
I'm afraid people will ask
where my son went.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.440
Here, go on.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.960
Hey, isn't that Meiqi?

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:41.359
Why is she coming back on an e-scooter?

00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:44.200
Yeah, pull it down a little.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.639
That's it.

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:45.200
Got it.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.519
Thanks for today.

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:51.719
Get home safe, alright?

00:08:52.479 --> 00:08:53.160
Bye.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.479
Meiqi!

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.839
Since you didn't drive back,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.719
how about I pick you up
tomorrow morning?

00:09:03.719 --> 00:09:05.440
No need. It's easy to grab a cab.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.080
Bye.

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:18.680
Excuse me, sir.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.359
You can't park your car here.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.599
Sorry.

00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:22.639
I'll move right away.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.040
Auntie's here.

00:10:02.719 --> 00:10:03.440
What's wrong?

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:05.719
What are you two up to?

00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:12.560
Meiqi,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.160
who just dropped you off?

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:16.960
A high school classmate.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:17.719
Who?

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.239
Do I know him?

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.759
Hu Gang. Do you remember him?

00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:22.879
He was the physics class rep.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.200
He now teaches physics
at Nanzhou High School.

00:10:26.119 --> 00:10:27.119
Oh, that guy.

00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:28.719
I remember him.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.719
He had really good grades.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.493
And he wasn't bad-looking either.

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:34.160
Just a little on the short side.

00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:35.560
Was my dad tall?

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.320
Does he like you?

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.999
Everyone likes me.
I'm the goddess, remember?

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.879
I don't see
what's so special about him.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.440
What's that supposed to mean?

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.119
Sneaking around
in a fancy neighborhood?

00:10:50.119 --> 00:10:51.400
He doesn't belong here.

00:10:52.337 --> 00:10:53.750
It's been years since graduation,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.839
and he's still riding an e-scooter?

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.280
By the way,
don't ride those things again.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.080
Trust me,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.048
they're dangerous.
It's flesh against metal.

00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:02.960
Come on.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.109
He works in the old town.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.448
With the narrow streets,
a scooter's more convenient.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.560
I just think

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.320
being a teacher is actually pretty good.

00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:11.759
It's stable.

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:12.999
That's all it is.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.680
A high school teacher?

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.920
What future does he even have?

00:11:16.893 --> 00:11:18.590
People talk about
"shaping young minds,"

00:11:18.599 --> 00:11:20.400
but what's that got to do with him?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.759
That's true.

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:23.080
He's stuck at that tiny

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.229
Nanzhou High School.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.537
He works long hours every day.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.990
And after the toiling every month,

00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:28.280
how much can he really make?

00:11:28.839 --> 00:11:29.829
Could he even afford

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:30.871
to buy Meiqi a handbag?

00:11:30.893 --> 00:11:32.630
Auntie, that's not fair to say.

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:34.759
Education means a lot in Nanzhou.

00:11:34.782 --> 00:11:35.760
And being a teacher

00:11:35.826 --> 00:11:37.280
is still a very respected job.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.800
Look, you should consider

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.599
your aunt's opinion.

00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:42.040
Only family

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.800
will tell you the truth, you know.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.879
Exactly.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.359
I may be blunt,

00:11:46.359 --> 00:11:47.400
but think about it.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.759
Am I wrong?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.680
If you actually married him,

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.280
say

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.040
you wanted to take a trip to Europe,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.999
what would he say?

00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:55.080
"Shanghai's nice enough."

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.440
How would that work?

00:11:58.639 --> 00:11:59.280
Meiqi,

00:11:59.479 --> 00:12:01.119
the Feng family's future depends on you.

00:12:01.359 --> 00:12:02.320
You need to find yourself

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.920
a good match that is on your level.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.560
That's right.

00:12:04.604 --> 00:12:05.440
I've asked your aunt

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.382
and your second uncle's wife.
We'll all help you.

00:12:07.382 --> 00:12:08.400
No, no, please don't!

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:09.080
Trust me,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.920
I'll really keep my eyes open.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.990
I'll check three generations
of his family if I must.

00:12:12.999 --> 00:12:14.920
You can't afford
to make another mistake.

00:12:15.119 --> 00:12:16.080
Don't worry, Sister.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.479
Lesson learned.

00:12:19.719 --> 00:12:20.519
Hear me out.

00:12:22.599 --> 00:12:23.639
Hu Gang

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:24.920
is a really good guy.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.519
Honest, dependable.

00:12:27.471 --> 00:12:29.110
I've decided to give it a try with him.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.040
Hu Gang,

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.493
don't forget to pick me up
for work tomorrow.

00:12:34.648 --> 00:12:36.337
Meet me at the gate. Don't stand me up.

00:12:55.879 --> 00:12:56.400
We're here.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:56.960
Alright.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.280
Mr. Hu, thank you.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.080
- Don't mention it.
- Thanks for the ride.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.839
It's nothing.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.519
This isn't nothing.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.879
We agreed last night.

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:07.239
Of course I'd pick you up.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.782
So you'll drive me every day, then?

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.119
Not every day,

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.759
I only have this morning off.

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:17.160
I even took leave to come.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.382
I'm just teasing you.
Go on, get to work.

00:13:20.719 --> 00:13:21.960
Hey, Meiqi.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.639
You looked a bit chilled last night,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.160
so I got you some medicine.

00:13:29.479 --> 00:13:30.400
You should take it.

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:33.960
Keeping me warm again, huh?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.626
Should this earn you brownie points?

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.400
You just asked me
if I could drive you every day...

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.648
I can during winter and summer breaks.

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:45.239
And I've already made plans.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.204
I signed up for driving school.

00:13:47.248 --> 00:13:48.693
I'll get my license soon.

00:13:48.719 --> 00:13:49.839
So next time you drink,

00:13:50.315 --> 00:13:51.493
I can drive you home.

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:52.040
Really?

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.599
Alright.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.119
I'm heading to work.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:55.920
Bye.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.479
Bye.

00:13:57.479 --> 00:13:58.200
Look,

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.359
this is my classmate's
hotel wedding package.

00:14:00.599 --> 00:14:01.960
It's absolutely magical.

00:14:02.239 --> 00:14:03.400
It does look nice.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.040
Must be pricey though.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.040
She said it starts at 12 tables.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.920
8,888 yuan per table.

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:12.160
They have their own
partner wedding company.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.519
Lots of themes to choose from.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.560
Here, look.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.879
This one's in
a traditional Chinese style.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.920
And this is the European palace style.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.639
She said if we book there,

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:21.839
she can get us a big discount.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.119
They all look good.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.693
If you like it, just book it.

00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:26.759
Did you hit the jackpot?

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.182
Even with a discount, you wouldn't?

00:14:29.293 --> 00:14:31.293
It's 8,888 yuan a table.

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:32.530
That's just the base price.

00:14:32.537 --> 00:14:34.048
I'd be out of my mind to book that.

00:14:34.119 --> 00:14:36.879
Places like Detian Building,
Huaiyang House,

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:38.160
or Nanxi Hotel

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.715
are around 3,000 a table,

00:14:39.737 --> 00:14:40.982
and the food's already great.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.320
We are ordinary folks.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.937
We don't need to show off like that.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.440
I was just saying.

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:46.680
I wouldn't want to

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.160
get married in such a flashy place.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.200
I might be stingy about most things,

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.248
but that's one expense
I'd never skimp on.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.800
A wedding is the most important day

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.040
in a woman's life.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.560
Sure, the wedding day's important.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.800
But what about the days after?

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.759
What about the day you have a baby?

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.759
Or the baby's first birthday?

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.759
Or when your child has a child?

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.519
What then?

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:08.160
Stop!

00:15:08.999 --> 00:15:10.160
If you keep counting,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.200
you'll end up including
our own funeral day.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.080
You're right.

00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:14.160
That day is

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.440
also important.

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:19.160
Alright, alright.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.879
What are you laughing at?

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:24.320
I...

00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:27.160
I just suddenly
remembered the day we first met.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.080
You said you went with your friend

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.782
to watch the guy she liked play soccer.

00:15:30.871 --> 00:15:32.750
They never got together, but we did.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.119
Four years is quite a while,
but not that long.

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:38.719
Somehow, it feels like a lifetime to me.

00:15:38.719 --> 00:15:39.999
Don't you think we already have

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.440
that old married couple vibe?

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.759
Kind of, yeah.

00:15:44.479 --> 00:15:45.239
Yuan Bichen.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.839
If you back out and don't marry me,

00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:49.440
I'll stay single for life.

00:15:49.599 --> 00:15:50.920
I'll just hold onto these memories

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.080
and grow old alone.

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:54.519
What's this about?

00:15:54.719 --> 00:15:55.639
Is this a threat?

00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:57.599
That's clearly a proposal!

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.920
A proposal?

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.560
Where's the ring?

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.826
It will be ready.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.800
Dad.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.937
Oh, you're both here.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.448
I was shopping for groceries.

00:16:21.537 --> 00:16:22.426
Mr. Yuan.

00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:26.280
We were just talking about buying rings.

00:16:27.359 --> 00:16:28.560
Alright, go ahead then.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.404
So, how's the discussion going?

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:35.999
We're going tomorrow.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.200
Good, that's great.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.999
Alright, you two carry on.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.599
Okay.

00:16:41.599 --> 00:16:42.359
Goodbye, Mr. Yuan.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.040
Alright.

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.839
That was so awkward.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.040
I almost had a heart attack.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.080
So embarrassing.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.920
Yeah, totally.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.400
Okay, calm down...

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.800
This looks great on you.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.040
You've got slim fingers.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.200
Simple, but elegant.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:04.960
But this one?

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.680
What do they call it? A halo ring?

00:17:06.804 --> 00:17:07.550
Yeah, a halo ring.

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:08.640
Actually, this is...

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.519
Manager Xia!

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.248
Do my brother
and his fiancée make a great couple?

00:17:12.279 --> 00:17:12.999
Of course!

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:14.559
Give them a discount.

00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:15.880
No problem.

00:17:16.048 --> 00:17:17.671
It's 40 percent off the diamond rings.

00:17:17.799 --> 00:17:18.840
For this one here...

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.400
It's just over ten grand after discount.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.120
I'd like to take a look there.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.310
Could you please
take out those two for me?

00:17:31.319 --> 00:17:32.039
These two?

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:32.920
Yes, thank you.

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:33.680
Chen,

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.960
you have to buy a diamond ring
for your wedding.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.120
Who still buys a gold ring?

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:39.920
See, that's where you don't get it.

00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:41.200
Diamond rings lose value fast.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.120
Gold holds its value.

00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:43.799
And gold rings never go on sale.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.920
See? I told you so.

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:48.239
Still, diamond rings are nicer.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.799
My mom's got
a family heirloom gold ring.

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:52.279
I'm sure she'll pass it down to you.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.680
Didn't you say Mom gave you the ring

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.937
and you'd give it to me?

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.537
Why would I give it to you?

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:01.160
It's for my wife, obviously.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.319
I don't even want it.

00:18:02.319 --> 00:18:03.400
I like this one.

00:18:03.519 --> 00:18:04.440
This is the one I want.

00:18:04.915 --> 00:18:07.200
Alright, if that's what you like,
then we'll get it.

00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:08.799
Try it on.

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:09.440
Okay.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.319
We'll take it.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.120
Sure thing.

00:18:13.239 --> 00:18:13.880
Zhixia.

00:18:14.648 --> 00:18:15.640
You're paying, right?

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.719
Kidding!

00:18:17.719 --> 00:18:19.319
Of course I'll pay for it myself.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.915
What do you think, Zhixia?

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:22.519
Bichen looks good in anything.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.239
What about me?

00:18:26.848 --> 00:18:27.960
Here, straighten up a bit.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.519
Okay.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.960
Mr. Lu, over here.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.239
Everything has been arranged.

00:18:32.519 --> 00:18:33.279
Miss Xu,

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.848
what do you think
about placing this here?

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.671
Face it toward the door.
I want people to see it as they come in.

00:18:38.693 --> 00:18:39.337
Like so?

00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:40.360
Mr. Lu,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.279
can we place it here?

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.479
Sure.

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:45.279
Wonderful!

00:18:45.519 --> 00:18:46.680
I really didn't expect

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.071
the independent-media business
to be this incredible.

00:18:49.093 --> 00:18:51.271
Promotion to sales,
all in one seamless process.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.640
Because Rufeng Liquor has great quality.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.360
That's why the sales took off so fast.

00:18:57.048 --> 00:18:59.390
No wonder it's "Zhixia Speaks".
You really know how to talk.

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:01.279
Zhixia, I honestly don't know

00:19:01.279 --> 00:19:02.519
how to thank you this time.

00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:03.640
You're too kind.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.471
Just leave the second half

00:19:05.493 --> 00:19:06.630
of the year's campaign to us.

00:19:06.648 --> 00:19:07.160
Of course.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.039
If you really want to thank me,

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:13.120
how about sending me
a case of your liquor?

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.920
Take it! As many as you want.

00:19:15.239 --> 00:19:16.759
From now on, Rufeng Liquor will supply

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:18.400
all the liquor your family needs.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.479
My whole family?

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:22.279
That's a big family.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.160
No problem at all.

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:30.719
Mingzhu.

00:19:33.319 --> 00:19:35.239
Zhixia? What brings you here?

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.426
Where are you headed?

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.549
Home for dinner.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.460
Let me give you a ride.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.030
No, it's fine.

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:40.160
It's not far from here.

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:43.880
Take this. Let your dad try it.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.680
What's this?

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.400
Liquor.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.519
Oh, no need.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:47.799
Don't be polite with me.

00:19:47.804 --> 00:19:49.737
I got two bottles
for your father-in-law too.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.380
I'll drop them off
at your building's gatehouse.

00:19:51.382 --> 00:19:52.137
Pick them up.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.360
Two bottles are more than enough.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.719
Don't argue with me.

00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:57.239
Be careful on your way home.

00:19:57.519 --> 00:19:58.319
Watch your belly.

00:19:58.319 --> 00:19:58.999
You too.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.920
Drinking in the middle of the day, huh?

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.120
Our daughter brought this back.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.719
Dad's been busy all morning.

00:20:12.719 --> 00:20:13.799
A sip will help him unwind.

00:20:13.982 --> 00:20:15.030
- That's right.
- Ru...

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.920
My daughter does care about me.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.279
Looks like your company is doing well.

00:20:19.279 --> 00:20:20.400
You're giving out free stuff.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.559
Fine liquor.

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:25.360
Really good.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:25.920
Right?

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.400
Then have some more.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.039
Yeah, drink up.

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:29.360
I'll get you some century eggs.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.680
That's what I like to hear.

00:20:32.079 --> 00:20:33.319
Don't just talk, get moving.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.559
You're sitting there like a lord.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.715
Grab a few cloves of garlic too.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.759
Dad.

00:20:43.999 --> 00:20:46.640
This liquor was from Xu Zhixia.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.239
From the firstborn of the Xu family?

00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:52.680
I helped her make a connection.

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.440
I got their liquor into our hotel.

00:21:00.079 --> 00:21:00.719
Mingzhu,

00:21:01.999 --> 00:21:03.400
I told you before.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.719
Whether you reconnect
with them is up to you.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.039
But after watching them for a while,

00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:09.719
I've noticed the way they do things

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.319
is a bit too reckless.

00:21:12.319 --> 00:21:13.319
Not exactly reliable.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.880
I think you'd better

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.799
keep some distance.

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:19.600
Okay.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.479
Here.

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:21.920
Still not ready yet?

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.840
What's okay?

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.039
I meant I know

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:26.519
Dad likes a drink at lunch.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.840
That's true.

00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:30.400
I only married him
because I didn't know better.

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:32.640
Meiqi!

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:33.880
Perfect timing.

00:21:34.719 --> 00:21:36.680
Here's last year's
Food Festival proposal.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.479
Take a look.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.600
This year, it has to be newer,
better, and more fun.

00:21:42.079 --> 00:21:43.160
Got it, I'll study it.

00:21:43.479 --> 00:21:44.160
Oh, right.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.160
The last page has
our list of old clients.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.719
Once the new proposal is ready,

00:21:47.719 --> 00:21:49.400
make sure every old client gets a copy.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.360
No problem.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.420
(Feng Zhi)

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:07.160
Feng!

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:11.400
Downsizing your spending, huh?

00:22:13.719 --> 00:22:14.319
Look at you.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.400
You were still a VIP
at Lijun Hotel last year.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.360
Business is tough these days.

00:22:22.719 --> 00:22:24.120
Times have changed.

00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:25.360
Oh, cut it out.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:27.719
Dad.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.360
You're hosting at Nanxi Hotel now?

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.640
Don't you think that's low-end?

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:34.479
They're all long-time
clients and friends.

00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:38.400
Everyone knows
I'm helping out my daughter-in-law.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.400
Then why not help
your own daughter too?

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.840
Top up maybe 50 or 100 grand.

00:22:42.519 --> 00:22:44.479
Your company doesn't even
give you sales quotas.

00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:46.680
Why put pressure on yourself?

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.680
You're the one who taught me

00:22:48.759 --> 00:22:49.719
to push myself harder.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.559
You call that pushing yourself?

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.079
You are ripping me off.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.400
This isn't a rip-off.

00:22:57.799 --> 00:22:59.680
Didn't you promise me

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.920
you'd support me once I found a job?

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.999
I'm not spending more now.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.799
Silly girl.

00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:39.079
Listen to my nag for a bit, okay?

00:23:42.519 --> 00:23:43.279
First of all,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.880
your hotel isn't
the same as Nanxi Hotel.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.279
Over there,
every employee has sales targets.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.120
But yours doesn't.

00:23:52.079 --> 00:23:53.999
You just need to do your own job well.

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:54.920
That's enough.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:55.999
See,

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.279
you just started working
and already bought a membership card.

00:23:59.648 --> 00:24:01.440
What do you think
other people will say?

00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:03.960
That's what we call
the “theater effect.”

00:24:04.479 --> 00:24:04.999
You're

00:24:04.999 --> 00:24:06.880
the first person to stand up
and watch the show.

00:24:07.319 --> 00:24:08.160
And once you do that,

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.999
everyone else stands up too.

00:24:09.999 --> 00:24:10.600
Then boom.

00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:14.640
Everyone's work pressure goes up.

00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:17.559
The KPIs get higher too.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.279
That's how you end up
with burnout and internal competition.

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:22.360
People are going to resent you.

00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:25.880
Mr. Feng, always full of theories.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.680
Mr. Feng's always right, okay?

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.440
Second of all...

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:31.759
There's more?

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:34.999
Fine.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.426
If you don't want to hear it,
I'll stop talking.

00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:43.799
No, I'll listen.

00:24:44.479 --> 00:24:45.200
Go ahead.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.120
Meiqi.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.039
You're not like Mingzhu.

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:55.239
Mingzhu can be taken care of.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.039
But you?

00:24:57.999 --> 00:24:59.759
You have to rely entirely on yourself.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.039
Why's that?

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.648
You're playing favorites.

00:25:06.239 --> 00:25:07.999
Because everyone in this family

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.640
will depend on you from now on.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.239
I don't care. You're playing favorites.

00:25:30.479 --> 00:25:31.880
You and Mom both are.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.719
(Xin City Grand Court)

00:25:40.719 --> 00:25:41.360
Miss Shen.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.120
A lady named Xu sent you some liquor.

00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:45.759
Okay, thank you.

00:25:45.759 --> 00:25:46.519
You're welcome.

00:26:00.279 --> 00:26:01.440
Didn't you hear the doorbell?

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:02.999
Nope.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:09.759
Dad.

00:26:09.759 --> 00:26:10.559
Mingzhu's here.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.519
Come in!

00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:12.079
Okay!

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.759
Next time, use the door code.

00:26:13.759 --> 00:26:14.840
No need to knock.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.279
She's reminding us

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.782
to also ring the doorbell
when we visit next door.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.519
Zip it.

00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:22.559
Dad.

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:23.680
This is from my colleague.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.989
It's their brand, Rufeng Liquor.

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.004
I heard it's really good.

00:26:26.026 --> 00:26:27.493
I brought a bottle for you to try.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.039
Oh, I've heard about this liquor.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:30.880
Not bad!

00:26:31.559 --> 00:26:33.069
The packaging looks so tacky though.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.515
And you call that good liquor?

00:26:34.515 --> 00:26:35.137
Meiqi!

00:26:35.382 --> 00:26:37.550
What? Can't I tell the truth?

00:26:38.719 --> 00:26:40.440
I have a right
to express myself, don't I?

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.239
You do have the right
to express yourself.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.626
But others also have

00:26:43.626 --> 00:26:45.271
the right to not like what you say.

00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:46.582
Some people will speak up,

00:26:46.604 --> 00:26:49.400
but most will just keep their distance.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.039
Exactly.

00:26:50.319 --> 00:26:51.440
Mingzhu's right.

00:26:52.079 --> 00:26:53.400
If you speak without thinking,

00:26:53.479 --> 00:26:55.479
you'll likely end up
offending people at work.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.799
So what if I offend someone?

00:26:56.799 --> 00:26:57.960
I'm not scared of that.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.840
I'm not a people-pleaser.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.160
Besides,

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.360
I don't have much
to talk about with my coworkers.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.279
Everything at work

00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:07.079
should be clear within three sentences.

00:27:07.079 --> 00:27:08.039
If it isn't,

00:27:08.479 --> 00:27:09.319
that's incompetence.

00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:16.840
This girl's spoiled rotten by me.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.182
The real world will teach her
how to behave.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:22.999
Honestly,

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:24.239
Mingzhu,

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.479
I hope you can teach her a bit more.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.440
It's hard for me

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.519
to let her go out there.

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:33.160
By the way,

00:27:33.479 --> 00:27:35.400
I heard Lijun Hotel is hiring right now.

00:27:36.479 --> 00:27:38.600
Have you thought about changing jobs?

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.479
It's closer to home,

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:42.999
and later you and Meiqi could
even commute together.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.840
Thanks, Dad, but no need.

00:27:45.999 --> 00:27:47.360
Nanxi Hotel is great.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.880
I've worked there for years.

00:27:48.999 --> 00:27:50.319
I'm attached to the place.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.826
And you know,
stick to what you're good at.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:53.782
Fair enough.

00:27:54.559 --> 00:27:56.680
Lijun Hotel's hiring standards
are high anyway.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.559
They usually only take
graduates from top universities.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.360
Dad, I'm heading out now.

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:07.559
Mr. Hu,

00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:08.920
are you free tonight?

00:28:09.319 --> 00:28:10.559
Come out for a drink.

00:28:15.799 --> 00:28:16.840
Sure, sure.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.160
When and where?

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.999
What can I get you two?

00:28:26.479 --> 00:28:28.200
I'll have a Cosmopolitan.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.039
And you?

00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:31.960
Just a glass of water is fine.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:35.271
Why'd you come to a bar
if you don't drink?

00:28:35.719 --> 00:28:37.519
How else
would I drive you home afterwards?

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.515
A glass of water for him.

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:42.640
Yes, one moment.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.360
Thanks.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:48.759
Hu Gang.

00:28:50.479 --> 00:28:52.200
Are you always this uptight?

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.079
Am I?

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.200
I just think everything
should be taken seriously.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.640
Like when I'm doing experiments.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.799
We always use three measuring tools.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.160
A ruler, a vernier caliper,

00:29:07.319 --> 00:29:08.559
and a micrometer screw gauge.

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:11.479
Can you fix a router?

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.671
Our Wi-Fi at home's been terrible.

00:29:13.671 --> 00:29:14.804
Router?

00:29:15.719 --> 00:29:16.319
Sure, I can.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.039
My girl...

00:29:32.759 --> 00:29:33.759
Another nightmare?

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:42.719
I dreamed of the old lady...

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.239
I dreamed of her!

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.160
She was trying to snatch
the baby from my arms!

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.079
Ever since we found Mingzhu,

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.799
you haven't had
a single good night's sleep.

00:29:56.479 --> 00:29:59.680
I carried the baby with all that pain,

00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:03.400
but I never even got to see her face.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.039
They took her away
before I could even touch her.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.920
Alright, alright, enough now.

00:30:12.079 --> 00:30:13.759
Here, take your medicine.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.279
Come on, take it.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.920
How did my daughter grow up?

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.848
Take the medicine.

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:20.719
Have some water.

00:30:23.079 --> 00:30:24.039
Did you swallow it?

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.880
Try to sleep,
and stop thinking about it.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.440
When will the paternity test
results come out?

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.880
That's what I'm afraid of.

00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:45.279
If it doesn't match,

00:30:46.239 --> 00:30:47.079
what then?

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.079
And if it does match,

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.039
what if the child won't accept us?

00:31:04.719 --> 00:31:05.440
Xiang.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.799
Don't cry.

00:31:07.079 --> 00:31:08.440
Don't cry. Come on.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.079
Look at me, look at me.

00:31:11.079 --> 00:31:12.559
I'll show you something.

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:15.319
But you must promise not to overreact.

00:31:15.799 --> 00:31:16.400
Okay?

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.559
Stay calm.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:18.600
Take a deep breath.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.960
No more crying, alright?

00:31:22.999 --> 00:31:23.960
Stop crying.

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:29.079
What is it?

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.759
The paternity test.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.360
The paternity test?

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.079
Where is it?

00:31:42.079 --> 00:31:43.360
Here, look. Right here.

00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:48.559
Yu Jingxiang...

00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.400
She's my daughter.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.440
Yes, yes.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.400
- She's my daughter.
- Yes, that's right.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.182
- She's my daughter!
- Okay, alright.

00:32:04.248 --> 00:32:05.360
Alright, calm down.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.999
Okay? You can rest easy now.

00:32:06.999 --> 00:32:08.719
See? You can finally stop worrying.

00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:10.360
It's okay now.

00:32:13.079 --> 00:32:13.999
Xu Dacheng,

00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:17.400
what's the meaning of this?

00:32:17.719 --> 00:32:18.479
What's going on?

00:32:18.479 --> 00:32:20.559
You and our daughter
teamed up to deceive me?

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:21.719
What's that supposed to mean?

00:32:21.719 --> 00:32:22.559
Look, Yu Jingxiang.

00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:25.360
Why did you do this to me, Xu Dacheng?

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.070
I kept it from you with our eldest

00:32:27.071 --> 00:32:28.960
because we knew
you'd lose control like this.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.559
You get it?

00:32:29.559 --> 00:32:30.920
The results are conclusive.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.680
I'm her biological mother!
She's my daughter!

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.559
My daughter!

00:32:34.559 --> 00:32:36.319
I'm going to bring my child home!

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.999
I'm bringing my daughter home!

00:32:38.079 --> 00:32:40.559
I'm her mother! Her real mother!

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:41.880
I'm taking her back myself!

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.559
Calm down!

00:32:42.559 --> 00:32:44.079
You'll only make things worse!

00:32:44.079 --> 00:32:46.400
I don't care! Worse or not,

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.799
I'm bringing my daughter home!

00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:50.440
Don't stop me!

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.039
Calm down!

00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:52.799
Don't you dare stop me!

00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:55.559
I'm going to get my daughter!

00:32:55.559 --> 00:32:57.079
Alright, go ahead!

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:57.799
Go on!

00:32:58.039 --> 00:32:59.039
I'll go with you.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.204
Burst into the Shen family's restaurant

00:33:01.239 --> 00:33:02.519
in the middle of the night,

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:04.559
slam this report on their table,

00:33:04.999 --> 00:33:05.759
and then what?

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.680
She's just going to accept us?

00:33:08.079 --> 00:33:09.920
And come running home obediently?

00:33:10.319 --> 00:33:12.360
What about the 30 years of their life?

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.640
Does that mean nothing?

00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:22.279
Think about it.

00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:24.079
All these years,

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.319
they never once came to us

00:33:26.319 --> 00:33:28.039
to reconnect with, did they?

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.960
They raised her as their own daughter.

00:33:31.759 --> 00:33:33.920
For the love and care alone,

00:33:34.239 --> 00:33:36.400
you can't just barge in like this.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.079
Besides,

00:33:39.799 --> 00:33:40.719
you know that girl

00:33:40.719 --> 00:33:42.360
is dealing with so much right now.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.989
At a time like this,

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:45.360
if you storm into their house,

00:33:45.404 --> 00:33:46.560
what kind of mother are you?

00:33:46.604 --> 00:33:48.070
You'd be worse and more selfish

00:33:48.079 --> 00:33:48.920
than a stepmother!

00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:08.039
Can it be fixed?

00:34:09.479 --> 00:34:10.199
It's not broken.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.679
I'm setting up

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.479
a mesh network for your house.

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:15.720
I'm connecting all your routers

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.840
wirelessly so they link together.

00:34:17.999 --> 00:34:19.199
That way, you'll have

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:20.559
full Wi-Fi coverage at home.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.400
No matter what room you're in,

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.479
you can game anywhere.

00:34:23.479 --> 00:34:24.639
Nice work, Mr. Hu.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.915
No trouble at all, Mr. Feng.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.920
Mr. Hu, this is remarkable.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.440
You know,

00:34:30.519 --> 00:34:32.119
many have high praise

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:33.519
for this house.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.559
Really.

00:34:34.999 --> 00:34:36.920
But honestly, I think it has flaws.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:38.440
It's too big.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:40.920
The Wi-Fi keeps dropping.

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:43.448
The technician from the telco company
came several times,

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:44.400
and never fixed a thing.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.760
We found the right guy this time.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.159
Mr. Hu here teaches physics.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.199
He is a real know-it-all.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.039
Meiqi is exaggerating.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:54.440
I like tinkering with this kind
of stuff in my spare time.

00:34:54.519 --> 00:34:56.519
Guess I happened to show up
at the right moment.

00:34:57.039 --> 00:34:58.840
You are too modest, Mr. Hu.

00:34:59.159 --> 00:34:59.920
Impressive.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.720
Mr. Hu,

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.880
have some water.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.930
- Thank you.
- Great work.

00:35:02.937 --> 00:35:03.804
Thank you.

00:35:04.639 --> 00:35:06.559
Stay for lunch.

00:35:06.679 --> 00:35:07.599
Oh no, Mrs. Feng.

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:09.119
I've got to head back to school soon.

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:10.840
My senior students
return this afternoon.

00:35:10.999 --> 00:35:11.840
It's alright.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.880
You must stay for lunch.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.599
Miss Mao!

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:14.199
Mrs. Feng...

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:15.720
Mr. Hu,

00:35:15.999 --> 00:35:17.039
you teach seniors?

00:35:17.159 --> 00:35:17.720
Yes.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.999
I teach physics
for two Grade 12 classes.

00:35:20.519 --> 00:35:21.920
Then, you must know Shen Minghui

00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:22.720
from Class 2?

00:35:22.999 --> 00:35:23.840
Of course I do.

00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:26.400
Meiqi said he's a real handful.

00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:35.679
He's your relative?

00:35:36.519 --> 00:35:37.400
My younger brother.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.479
Wait,

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.599
you two don't look alike at all.

00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:44.119
We're not blood siblings.

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:52.840
What's going on with it now?

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.240
Almost done, Mr. Feng.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.039
- Almost?
- Good.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.079
Mr. Hu,

00:35:58.079 --> 00:35:59.280
thank you so much.

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:00.559
You're too kind.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:01.880
That's right.

00:36:02.039 --> 00:36:02.960
Come by again.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.029
Sure thing.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.582
If your home network acts up again,

00:36:05.626 --> 00:36:06.550
just give me a call.

00:36:06.639 --> 00:36:07.760
I can fix it anytime.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.048
Thanks, we really appreciate it.

00:36:09.093 --> 00:36:09.671
Thank you!

00:36:09.693 --> 00:36:10.760
Oh, if your little brother

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.109
has any physics questions,

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.337
he can come to me anytime.

00:36:13.382 --> 00:36:14.630
I live in the school dorms.

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.079
That's perfect, thanks, Mr. Hu.

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:16.760
You're welcome.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.782
Stay safe on the road.

00:36:17.804 --> 00:36:18.610
I'll get going then.

00:36:18.626 --> 00:36:18.990
Meiqi.

00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:20.240
Walk Mr. Hu out.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.629
No need. He's not a kid.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:22.689
He can see himself out.

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:23.240
Don't be rude.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.760
It's fine. I'll see myself out.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:25.960
Goodbye.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.400
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

00:36:27.559 --> 00:36:28.280
Alright.

00:36:29.039 --> 00:36:30.159
Okay, goodbye.

00:36:30.159 --> 00:36:30.960
Bye.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.280
Mr. Hu is really capable.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.280
One big problem solved.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.100
When I watch TV play,

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.220
the Wi-Fi won't cut out anymore!

00:36:44.679 --> 00:36:46.479
Before, it was always buffering.

00:36:46.479 --> 00:36:48.400
It was so slow.
That really drove me crazy.

00:36:49.199 --> 00:36:51.079
Honestly, Mr. Hu doesn't seem

00:36:51.079 --> 00:36:52.679
too bad at all.

00:36:53.079 --> 00:36:55.440
I agree. He's got such
a steady way about him.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.119
Exactly.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.720
That night

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.720
was too dark.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.240
I didn't get a clear look.

00:37:00.559 --> 00:37:01.199
I just thought

00:37:01.199 --> 00:37:03.400
riding that little e-scooter
was too unsafe.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.639
But seeing him today,
he's really a good one.

00:37:07.159 --> 00:37:08.960
Hardworking, polite, and honest.

00:37:09.519 --> 00:37:11.999
If only he were a bit taller,
he'd be perfect.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.079
Nobody's perfect.

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:15.280
But I think he'd make a good son-in-law.

00:37:16.039 --> 00:37:17.920
His EQ is a bit of a shame.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.199
His EQ?

00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:20.679
Who cares about that?

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.920
Men with high EQ
are the ones most likely to cheat.

00:37:23.039 --> 00:37:23.800
Right, Feng?

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.400
Alright, let's not go there.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.760
Stick to the point.

00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:28.800
The point is,

00:37:29.039 --> 00:37:30.159
since Jianqi's gone,

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.039
our family needs

00:37:32.039 --> 00:37:33.920
a solid, reliable man around.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.119
The point is,

00:37:35.679 --> 00:37:36.720
I'm looking for a husband,

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.800
not a handyman.

00:37:38.119 --> 00:37:39.960
Being steady's great and all,

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.479
but maybe ask
if I'm even interested first?

00:37:43.599 --> 00:37:44.240
Meiqi,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.159
if you're not into him,

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.599
why lead the poor guy on?

00:37:48.999 --> 00:37:50.440
That's not leading him on.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.199
It's Hu Gang's honor.

00:37:56.119 --> 00:37:57.960
He's a physics teacher,
for crying out loud.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.920
He was crawling around
on your floor fixing your Wi-Fi,

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.559
and you call that an honor?

00:38:03.199 --> 00:38:04.199
Are you the royal family?

00:38:05.039 --> 00:38:06.119
They are my in-laws.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.240
It's all the same.

00:38:07.599 --> 00:38:08.440
I'm telling you,

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.515
you'd better stay sharp.

00:38:09.537 --> 00:38:11.004
Don't let them rub off on you.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.960
Do you find Mr. Hu handsome?

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.599
Mr. Hu's got that

00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:16.999
cute look.

00:38:17.479 --> 00:38:18.999
Polite, neat, glasses and all.

00:38:18.999 --> 00:38:20.119
He looks like a science guy.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.119
Do you have a picture?

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.920
How could I possibly have his photo?

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.960
His picture might be
on Nanzhou High School's webpage.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:27.999
Let's check it out.

00:38:33.159 --> 00:38:35.199
Let's see if we can find him.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.860
(Hu Gang, Senior Physics Teacher)

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.079
He does look kind of cute.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.599
Mr. Hu is

00:38:44.599 --> 00:38:46.119
exactly my type.

00:38:46.679 --> 00:38:48.599
Please, everyone is your type.

00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:49.920
He really is cute.

00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:51.840
Ni.

00:38:52.679 --> 00:38:54.400
I'm here for the makeup trial!

00:38:55.159 --> 00:38:56.079
Come on.

00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:56.920
- Take a seat.
- Hi.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.519
Hi!

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.119
You're here for a trial too?

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.400
She's my friend.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.180
- She came to help out.
- Just volunteering.

00:39:02.559 --> 00:39:03.519
What a good friend!

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.039
Ni, check this for me.

00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:07.280
I found this picture yesterday.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.800
It's this vintage look.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.199
Do you think it suits me?

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.159
It does.

00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:15.840
But we shouldn't copy it exactly.

00:39:16.199 --> 00:39:18.720
Your features are softer, see?

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.320
Too much contouring won't work.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.720
We should emphasize natural brows

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.920
and define the lips a little.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.599
Let's go for
a modern-vintage Chinese style.

00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:27.999
Sure.

00:39:27.999 --> 00:39:29.280
Do it. I can't wait to see it.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.119
Here, have a drink.

00:39:30.199 --> 00:39:30.999
Thanks!

00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:32.800
By the way,

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.159
where is your wedding banquet?

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.720
I'm still searching.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.199
Not every hotel

00:39:37.199 --> 00:39:38.760
can pull off a vintage wedding theme.

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:41.079
You should check out Nanxi Hotel.

00:39:41.519 --> 00:39:42.679
That's where I work.

00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:44.400
Our banquet hall

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.999
has this '90s vibe.

00:39:46.119 --> 00:39:47.639
It's very retro.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.199
And the food is great too.

00:39:49.199 --> 00:39:51.199
It's made by experienced chefs.

00:39:51.199 --> 00:39:53.559
But Nanxi Hotel is a bit old-fashioned.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.479
There are tons of new places
in the new district.

00:39:56.479 --> 00:39:57.800
All of them do wedding packages.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.119
Of course we'll go with something new.

00:40:00.639 --> 00:40:01.479
Well, that's true.

00:40:01.679 --> 00:40:02.360
Mingzhu.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.440
Talk to your boss about it.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.839
You should roll out
a wedding banquet package too.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.999
It's time for the old hotel

00:40:07.999 --> 00:40:09.159
to ride the wave again.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.840
So, can you even handle

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.440
a wedding banquet?

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.400
As in

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.159
the whole wedding process?

00:40:19.199 --> 00:40:20.039
Sure can.

00:40:20.639 --> 00:40:22.320
Just give me a starting point

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.519
and a bit of funding.

00:40:23.519 --> 00:40:24.960
I can make sworn enemies get married,

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.039
and make rivals thankful.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.159
Let me grab this call.

00:40:31.159 --> 00:40:31.760
Okay.

00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:35.280
Hello, Mom?

00:40:35.559 --> 00:40:36.199
Hey.

00:40:37.039 --> 00:40:37.800
Ni!

00:40:38.599 --> 00:40:40.519
Are you busy? Can we talk for a minute?

00:40:40.519 --> 00:40:42.360
Say it. Make it quick.

00:40:43.119 --> 00:40:45.509
I just helped an old couple

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:47.182
reissue their marriage certificate.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:47.999
Guess why

00:40:47.999 --> 00:40:49.639
they wanted to reissue it?

00:40:49.639 --> 00:40:50.519
To get divorced?

00:40:50.519 --> 00:40:51.999
You can't divorce without one.

00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:53.760
You're so negative.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:54.960
Listen.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.559
They reissued it

00:40:56.999 --> 00:40:58.119
for

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.119
relocation housing.

00:41:00.559 --> 00:41:03.440
Six new apartments,
all in the new district.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.960
Even if they got sixty,
it has nothing to do with me.

00:41:06.159 --> 00:41:09.360
The main thing is
that they only have one son.

00:41:11.079 --> 00:41:11.840
He's not married.

00:41:12.519 --> 00:41:14.240
He's about your age.

00:41:14.559 --> 00:41:15.360
And?

00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:18.999
I'm not a money-hungry person.

00:41:18.999 --> 00:41:19.599
Right?

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.360
I care about character too.

00:41:22.199 --> 00:41:23.119
Any photos?

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:24.960
Can you tell
a person's character from a photo?

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.840
But you're right.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.599
Hold on, I'll ask them for one.

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:31.320
This one's good.

00:41:31.479 --> 00:41:32.320
What's good about him?

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.960
His background.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.479
Six houses.
Do you know what that means?

00:41:36.479 --> 00:41:36.920
Just wait.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.160
When I get married,
I'll hold it at Nanxi Hotel.

00:41:39.559 --> 00:41:41.320
Ni, the way you're talking,
even I'm tempted.

00:41:41.679 --> 00:41:42.599
Too late for that.

00:41:42.599 --> 00:41:43.440
You've already posted

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.039
your wedding photos.

00:41:45.159 --> 00:41:45.880
What a shame.

00:41:46.559 --> 00:41:48.360
Didn't you say
Hu Gang is just your type?

00:41:48.559 --> 00:41:49.679
Don't rush it.

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:51.720
One thing at a time.

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:56.559
Here it is!

00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.360
Look.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.800
Tell me what I should do.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.782
How do I make
that little rich boy lose interest in me

00:42:13.782 --> 00:42:15.470
without offending my mom?

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.519
Easy. Just make yourself look awful.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.848
Put on ugly makeup.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.119
I'll stick a mole here,

00:42:22.199 --> 00:42:23.519
add another one here,

00:42:23.519 --> 00:42:25.360
and wear a big red flower here.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.159
Then, throw on a frilly lace dress.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.737
You'd look like a matchmaker.

00:42:30.679 --> 00:42:33.039
Come on, six houses!

00:42:33.479 --> 00:42:34.880
Can't you just put up with it?

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.840
You think I don't want to?

00:42:38.159 --> 00:42:39.720
I just can't stand it.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.400
If you

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.720
ever remarry, would you take him?

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.519
No way.

00:42:42.519 --> 00:42:44.360
He's nowhere near
as good as Feng Jianqi.
