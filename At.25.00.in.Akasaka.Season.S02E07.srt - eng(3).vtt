00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.540
You...

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.210
You...

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.130
What do you...

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.130
- You...
- What do you know about me?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.580
I didn't do anything.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.790
I never thought
about stealing the lead role from him.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.000
And I wasn't confident I could take him down.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.380
It's just that...

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.210
In this world,
you can't survive on luck alone.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.210
He didn't have...

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.250
the talent.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.540
Kuroki.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.290
The lead role is yours.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.960
I'm counting on you.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.540
I...

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.040
Shirasaki.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.630
There's no place for you here.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.460
What do you know about me?

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.500
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 7)

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.250
I told you, nothing's wrong.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.500
Don't lie to me.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.670
We've been together for two years.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.920
I know you.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.460
What do you know about me?

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.250
Ever since that outsider disappeared,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.380
you haven't seemed right.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.040
Something must have happened, right?

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.330
Well...

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.210
I didn't do anything.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.790
- Do you believe...
- Sorry, let's take a break.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.210
Okay.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.880
Shirasaki.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.420
Are you feeling unwell?

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.790
Huh?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.500
I'm fine.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.040
Okay.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.790
You can go home for the day.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.330
Pushing yourself won't do you any good.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.460
- Kuroki.
- Yes?

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.750
Excuse me.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.460
Can you play Muroga's part again?

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.670
Of course.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.130
I can do it. I can, Aoyama-san.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.580
Wait, Shirasaki.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.500
If you're going to stay,

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.420
just sit and watch.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.710
So,

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.380
So you always saw him as a threat.

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:21.583
You're sick of him, but you also envy him.

00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:24.667
You even want him dead.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.500
No, I never thought that.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.170
You're not gentle at all.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.290
You're actually a cunning, cold,
and despicable person.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.790
That's why...

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.210
you killed Muroga and took his place, didn't you?

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.210
You too?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.920
Are you also here to get in my way?

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.040
If that's the case...

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.880
Lights dim.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.670
Okay, thank you both.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.920
Thank...

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.000
Okay.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.830
- Muroga.
- Yes?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.130
- That was powerful, nice work.
- Thank you.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.330
- Fukuyama.
- Yes?

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.790
You need to let go more.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.420
Let go more?

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.000
- Let go more.
- Yes.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.250
You seemed pretty despicable just now,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.880
but you can be even more so.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.500
The way you grab him
looks a little dangerous.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.920
You two need to work on syncing up.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.500
- I understand.
- Keep at it.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.960
Next, for Mitarai's part...

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.790
Also...

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.080
Director Imai sent over the revised script
for the climax.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.710
Hold on, I'll go print it.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.750
Thank you.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.540
Hello?

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.880
Asami?

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.670
Mom.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.540
You haven't been back home.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.420
Are you doing okay?

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.330
Sorry.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.250
I've been too busy.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.460
I see.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.790
What's up?

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.500
A package arrived for you.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.170
A package?

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.920
Who's it from?

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.250
It's from your father.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.790
Huh?

00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.750
"I want to play the lead in 'Rain and Confession'."

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.380
You know... there's a novel I love
called 'Rain and Confession.'

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.710
I was fascinated by the main character.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.040
I'm home.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.130
You're early today.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.290
Welcome back.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.000
This...

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.250
I saw it.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.500
Why didn't you tell me?

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.710
You really wanted to play the role of Muroga, didn't you?

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.960
Sorry.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.290
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.330
Shirasaki?

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.580
Asami-san.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.540
Please, snap me out of it.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.790
- Huh?
- Please...

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.790
Snap me out of it.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.460
- Snap you...
- Snap me out of it.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.420
Why?

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.000
Don't ask questions. Just slap me.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.500
What?

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.960
I'm not going to do something so violent.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.080
Don't worry, I won't sue you.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.000
Is that the point?

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.750
If you don't,

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.630
I'm going to fall apart.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.830
I feel so pathetic.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.250
So useless. I hate this version of myself.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.290
Come on, please.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.790
Well, if you insist.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.000
Here I come.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:03.920
Go ahead.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.630
Mmm.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.000
Shirasaki.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.540
Have you lost weight?

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.420
Um...

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.080
That didn't snap me out of it at all.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.920
Because I didn't want to hit you.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.000
But I said it was okay.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.330
Well then...

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.130
If I told you to hit me, would you?

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.290
- No.
- Exactly.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.420
Come here.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.580
Sit down.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.380
Did something happen at rehearsal?

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.290
Can't you tell me?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.420
Because...

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.670
It's true.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:11.330
I've always wanted to play Muroga.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.830
But...

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.210
I now feel just as strongly

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.330
about wanting to see you play the role of Muroga.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.670
I'm trying my best to play him,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.500
but I'm just not getting it right.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.670
Things like vocalization,

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.130
being conscious of the audience,
and interpreting the lines.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.540
I've been thinking about all of it,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.630
but it's still not working at all.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:55.960
Today, too.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.290
They wouldn't even let me finish my lines.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.670
There's an actor in the cast named Kuroki.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.460
If this keeps up, he might take the role from me.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.290
Do you remember?

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.000
Back in college,

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.420
you played a criminal once, right?

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.380
Huh?

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.880
Yeah.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.040
Back then...

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.290
it was the first time I saw you act.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.130
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.380
Ever since I first met you,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.540
you know, I've always loved your acting.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.830
Oh...

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.170
Asami-san.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.630
Yeah?

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.920
Thank you.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.790
For cheering me up.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.040
Did that actually help?

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.630
It helped a lot.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.000
It helped?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.210
Yes.

(Stage Play "Rain and Confession" Rehearsal)

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.380
What do you know about me?

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.580
Ever since that outsider disappeared,

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.210
you haven't seemed right.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.500
Something must have happened, right?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.750
I told you I didn't do anything.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.830
Just believe me, okay?

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.130
No...

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.330
What do you know about me?

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.460
You haven't seemed right.

Something must have happened, right?

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.920
I told you I didn't do anything.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.540
Believe...

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.540
Just believe me, okay?

(TV Series "Daydream" Audition)
Okay, thank you.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.920
So, could you tell us what you
and the character you're auditioning for, Takumi,

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.210
have in common?

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.170
Takumi is a very straightforward person.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.580
His feelings for Ryoji
are stronger than anyone else's.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.170
I feel that Takumi's straightforward personality
is very similar to my own.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.330
Then, Kuroki-san,

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.000
is there anything about you
that you'd "never lose to anyone" in?

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.880
The passion I pour into my acting.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.880
That feeling of "I have to play Takumi, no matter what".

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.580
I won't lose to anyone in that.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.960
- Good work.
- You too.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.380
(Daydream)

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.170
Shirasaki Yuki.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.000
(Rehearsal for the play "Rain and Confession")

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.960
What do you know about me?

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.710
Good morning.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.960
You're here early.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.000
Are you feeling better?

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.130
Um...

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.460
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.040
Don't worry about it.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.830
I was actually fine with things staying as they were.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.330
Aoyama-san said it too.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.580
Nothing good comes from forcing it.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.000
Maybe it's better if they just recast the role.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:38.830
What is it?

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.130
Please, give me some advice.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.130
What?

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:49.460
Kuroki-san, you were great as Muroga.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.170
It's frustrating to admit...

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.750
but you were really amazing.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.290
I don't have much experience on stage.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.630
I was hoping you could tell me
what I'm missing.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.670
Why don't you just ask Aoyama-san?

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.790
I will, of course, but...

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.210
As far as acting goes,
you're the one I've worked with the most, Kuroki-san.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.460
That's why I want to ask you.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.630
Please.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.710
Don't lie to me. We've been together for two years.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.540
I know you.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.130
What do you know about me?

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.170
Ever since that outsider disappeared,

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.630
you haven't seemed right.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.540
Something definitely happened, didn't it?

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.790
I'm telling you, I didn't do anything.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.420
Please, just believe me.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:23.670
Well?

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.630
Hmm.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.000
When you're performing...

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.920
what's on your mind?

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.000
Are you too worried about what Aoyama-san thinks?

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.170
Or are you just hung up on
the idea of "I have to nail this"?

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.830
Maybe...

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.670
Sorry.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.130
Look, like I said...

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.630
I seriously don't mind if they recast me.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.080
No.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.210
It's just...

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.750
I love your acting, Kuroki-san.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.210
But this role...

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:10.920
the role of Muroga...

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.880
I want to be the one to play him.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.920
I love Ryoji-san.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.040
Yeah.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.130
I get it.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.670
Huh?

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.790
No matter how much you admire someone's acting,

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.460
it still sucks when a role you want
gets taken away from you.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.420
What is it?

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.330
What?

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.540
I was just thinking
maybe Muroga feels the same way in this scene.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:14.330
Go on.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.790
So...

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.130
As his best friend, Muroga cares about Mitarai.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.500
Right.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:22.130
But...

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:26.170
he's being suspected of murder by that very friend.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.920
If...

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.710
his past crimes are exposed...

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.170
and the peaceful life he finally managed
to build is stripped away...

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.790
he would be furious.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.250
That's why.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.630
He needs Mitarai to believe him, no matter what.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.420
Because if he doesn't...

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.960
to hide his own crimes...

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:50.960
Muroga...

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.830
will have no choice but to kill his best friend.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.420
I don't want to kill you.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.130
So I need you to believe me.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:11.130
Don't... make me kill you.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.710
Let's run that scene again.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:18.460
Okay.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.670
I told you, it's nothing.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:28.540
Don't lie to me.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.460
We've been together for two years.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.290
I know you.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.710
What do you know about me?

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.750
Ever since that outsider disappeared,

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.170
you haven't been yourself.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.250
Something happened, didn't it?

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:03.170
I told you I didn't do anything.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.000
Please...

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.130
believe me.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:11.830
Okay?

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.170
Brilliant!

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.460
Alright, Fukuyama, you're up.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.040
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.040
Shirasaki.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.880
I was worried about you.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.080
Sorry.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.040
That was a great performance.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.040
Thank you.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.000
Alright, from Act 6.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.630
And so,

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.540
Kuroki-san has been helping me rehearse.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.130
He's been helping you?

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.500
Yeah.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:08.880
I see.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.750
I'm glad everything worked out.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.790
I have to thank you too, Asami-san.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.580
For encouraging me.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.500
Of course.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.880
Shirasaki.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.670
You don't have rehearsal tomorrow, do you?

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.460
- In that case, would you like to...
- Oh.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.710
Huh?

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.380
It's Kuroki-san.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.630
Sorry, do you mind if I take this?

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.920
We were just talking about
getting together for some extra practice tomorrow.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:33.960
Is that so?

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.170
Yeah.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.580
Hello? Sorry, I was just eating.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.750
Yeah.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.290
So what time tomorrow?

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.170
Eight o'clock?

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.000
(Preview)
It's easy acting opposite Shirasaki.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.000
It's only natural for actors to get close.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.670
I was starting to wonder... Are you jealous?

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.880
Well, what do you expect when you're so close with Kuroki?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.250
My father's novel...

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.670
is being adapted into a film by a studio in the UK.
