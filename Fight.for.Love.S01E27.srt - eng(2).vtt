(Qingzhou Yamen)

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.600
Chusheng,

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.430
sorry about today.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.480
I shouldn't have drunk

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.350
so much with you,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.710
causing your disagreement

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.950
with General Wei.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.200
Here's the medicine for swelling.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.270
Remember to use it.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.590
Thank you, Xu.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.070
Sorry for you to see this.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.360
I didn't expect you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.560
to be such an affectionate man,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.870
still pining

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.960
for Ms. Chu.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.030
General Wei

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.520
was just too harsh,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.990
not respecting you at all.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.190
What's the deal

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.280
between General Wei and Ms. Chu?

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.870
If Wei Yun hadn't pestered her

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.710
and crossed the line,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.840
Yu wouldn't have ended up

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.750
in such a situation.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.430
Wei Yun

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.960
is not as steady as Wei Jun.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.560
He always acts

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.590
on a whim.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.240
Look.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.110
He's even tried to set you up,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.200
hasn't he?

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.360
Wei Yun just arrived in Qingzhou

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.910
and wanted to replace

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.750
the existing defense.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.430
He said it was

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.590
to let the Wei Army
and the Qingzhou garrison

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.870
take turns on guard

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.000
to rest and regain strength.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.460
But in reality,

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.470
he just saw that you had

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.060
considerable prestige in Qingzhou

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.690
and wanted to marginalize you.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.360
With so many years

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.300
in the officialdom,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.660
you surely can see through his tricks.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.870
General Wei holds a high position,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.690
is deeply trusted by the Emperor,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.500
and has military power.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.520
It's only natural for him

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.130
to have such thoughts.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.300
You don't know.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.110
Wei Yun's succession to the title
was unconvincing.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.630
Many officials in the court

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.750
often impeach him.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.240
He's eager to achieve military merits

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.970
to silence the gossip

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.680
and make the soldiers of the Wei Army

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.690
submit to him.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.870
Be careful with him.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.190
Once he has the chance

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.220
to achieve military merits

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.850
and gain more power,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.500
Ms. Chu will be

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.750
even less likely

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.220
to return to your side.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.120
Chusheng,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000
I was just speaking off the cuff.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.530
You mustn't take it to heart.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.900
If he wants to achieve merits,

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.290
I'll let him.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.140
Generals are bound to die in battle;

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.020
jars always break near the well.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.430
If General Wei

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.100
dies on the battlefield,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.220
then Yu will be mine.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.500
Xu,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.360
for the sake of your relationship

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.660
with my father,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.220
please help me.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.100
Crossbowmen, listen!

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.370
Shoot!

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.300
Stop!

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.370
General Chu,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.710
the octagonal crossbow improved
by Commander Lu

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.700
is really amazing.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.180
The mechanism is sturdy,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.920
and the problem of excessive recoil

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.120
has been completely solved.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.540
During the test,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.300
it didn't hurt the crossbowman's wrist.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.660
Compared to before,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.860
the penetration power

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.340
has also increased significantly.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.730
North Qi first used
the octagonal crossbow

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.340
in Fengling City.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.510
If we are to fight again
in Fengling City,

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.040
they'll surely use it again

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.980
to attack the city.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.850
With this improved octagonal crossbow,

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.420
our chances of winning
will be much greater.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.210
It's just a pity

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.430
that the mineral
for making the mechanism

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.370
is in short supply,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.240
and we can't achieve mass production.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.670
By the way,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.830
hasn't Commander Lu already

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.830
arrived in Fengling?

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.770
Why haven't we seen him?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.900
He went to find the Eldest Princess.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.420
(General's Mansion)

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.850
Why did it suddenly explode?

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.170
Was it because of excessive fire?

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.300
Miss Song.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.370
Miss Song.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.610
Linyang,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.680
I just wanted

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.270
to make these hemostatic herbs

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.220
into pills for the soldiers.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.720
I didn't expect it

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.100
to turn out like this.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.500
Are you hurt?

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.390
I dodged in time

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.580
during the explosion,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.260
so I wasn't injured.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.180
Linyang,

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.100
you care about me, right?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.460
This is the pill I made.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:28.970
It's very portable

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.220
and has many uses.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:34.730
Linyang, I came...

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.940
Is it the right time?

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.130
Chu Yu.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.540
Miss Song,

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.690
your umbrella.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.200
Good.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.140
Lu Qiba did a good job.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.690
Linyang,

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.480
I came this time

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.480
to bring the Eldest Princess

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.420
back to Huajing.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.060
- Listen.
- Linyang,

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.270
don't rush

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.700
to persuade me yet.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.080
Think about what to do

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.120
with your problems first.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.540
Come on.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.300
How can I persuade you?

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.030
I'm busy with drills and patrols

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.970
every day.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.240
What problem could I have?

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.850
You don't know.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.580
After you left,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.130
the Duke of Hu visited us.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.870
He first scolded you,

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.630
and then he hinted

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.080
that he wanted to arrange

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.200
a marriage with our family.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.490
It's about Mr. Song

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.730
and Jin, right?

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.700
It's about Tuantuan and you.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.730
Mother didn't know your feelings,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.240
so she treated the Duke of Hu
to some good tea

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.300
and didn't dare to agree.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.060
Linyang,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.540
answer me.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.040
What do you think about this?

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:47.450
We

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.610
are not suitable.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.380
Yu,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:53.970
don't bring this up again.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:11.570
(Oh, no.)

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.100
(I can't leave her alone.)

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.490
Linyang, where are you going?

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.580
The mansion has long been empty.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.810
With the sudden rain,

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.840
the barracks where the soldiers live

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.780
might leak.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.970
I'll go check.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.600
Miss Song,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.540
are you okay?

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.850
Linyang,

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.580
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.210
Sorry.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.750
If you're scared,

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.670
put this cotton

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.610
in your ears.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.900
It will help.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.540
Linyang,

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.600
if you tell me

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.950
you only see me as a sister again,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.940
I won't believe that.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.910
You know
that I'm not afraid of loud noises.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.970
I was pretending.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.580
I've had at least 80 exploded jars

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.370
in my hands.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.000
Even if I were scared,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.200
I would've gotten used to it.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.610
I bet you'd come,

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.900
and you really did.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.460
Only when you truly love someone

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.700
can you tolerate their lies.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.820
So,

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.120
you were worried about me,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.600
which is why you didn't dare to bet.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.900
Chu Linyang,

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.150
do you even know

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.300
that you like me?

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.420
Get some rest.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.180
Linyang.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.730
Chu Yu,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.630
when I pretended to be scared

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.570
in front of Linyang,

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.770
you must've noticed, right?

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.130
Thank you for not exposing me.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.340
You did a good job,

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.030
but Linyang

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.240
is an iron tree.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.460
It'll be hard for him to bloom.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.020
Chu Yu,

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.490
do you think

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.820
Linyang likes me?

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.970
Linyang

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.460
grew up in Fengling,

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.340
following Father to guard the city.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.940
So, in his heart,

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.220
Fengling City is like his home,

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.960
and the people here

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.180
are like his family.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.090
Therefore,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.820
in my opinion,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.130
Linyang surely likes you,

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.820
but Fengling is

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.060
too important to him.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.500
The responsibilities and worries
on his shoulders

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.300
have held him back from coming to you.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.220
Do you understand

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.330
what I'm saying?

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.460
I believe that one day,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.800
Linyang will surely follow

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.810
his heart

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.900
and come to you.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.420
But until then,

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.970
you must hold on.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.540
You're right.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.610
In this life,

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:07.920
it's not easy

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.960
to meet someone

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.010
you truly like.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.260
There's no problem that can't be solved.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.610
If you give up on happiness

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.610
out of fear,

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.540
that's just silly.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.750
I must warm up

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.260
this cup of tea.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.650
By the way, Chu Yu,

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.750
aren't you supposed to be

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.300
with Young Marquis Wei?

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.410
Why suddenly come to Fengling?

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.160
Once we find out

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.100
who is behind Yao Yong

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.540
and everything is settled,

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.450
I will confess

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.370
our relationship to everyone.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.310
Life is not

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.850
only about love.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.460
There are always more important things

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.770
waiting for us.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.380
(Qingzhou Yamen)

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:54.930
If it's a welcome banquet,

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:56.750
don't you think

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:57.780
it's too late?

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.680
Lately, I've seen you busy

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.110
with the city's affairs.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.270
You must be tired.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.790
Today, I suddenly heard

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.030
that you're free,

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.410
so I set up this banquet.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.200
Sorry about my poor entertainment.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.780
I'll punish myself with a drink.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.860
Mr. Xu, don't rush.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.690
If this drink is a punishment,

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.650
I'll accept it.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.370
But you only invited me

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.410
and Supervisor Gu today.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.740
You must want something.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.720
I heard from the servants

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.680
that you two had

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.500
some disagreements two days ago.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.920
So, I set up the banquet

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.980
to act as a mediator.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.450
Please don't blame me for doing this

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.610
without asking your permission.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.050
How could we?

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.020
Mr. Xu, do you know

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.540
that Supervisor Gu
spoke rudely that day,

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.300
causing the conflict?

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.500
I've heard something about it.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.960
But now, with enemies before us,

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.850
we should work together.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.310
However serious the grievances are,

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.270
you shouldn't fight

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.850
so fiercely at this moment.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.160
If the people of Qingzhou

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.510
know about it,

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.720
how can they trust

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.260
the officials of Great Sui?

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.620
What do you think?

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.300
You're absolutely right.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.720
That day,

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.930
General Wei and I

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.060
didn't think it through.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.000
I know

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.020
what's important.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.020
But even now,

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.070
I still think

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.310
that Supervisor Gu

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.260
was too rude that day.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.500
To patch things up,

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.030
it depends on how far

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.300
Supervisor Gu can go.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.610
As the saying goes,

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.260
a real man can bend and stretch.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.500
One should take a step back

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.410
to achieve success.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.490
What do you think,

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.100
Supervisor Gu?

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.310
That day, I spoke without thinking,

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.550
disregarding the bigger picture

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.540
and crossing the line.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.410
General Wei,

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.660
please forgive me.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.790
Is this the best

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.020
you can do?

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.340
I wonder

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.780
if this is good enough.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.340
Barely.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.610
Mr. Xu knows

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.300
that you two have been
working hard lately

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.120
and probably don't want to go
to the yamen,

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.710
so he asked us to bring the wine

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:20.810
and dishes here.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.800
With General Wei

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.850
and Supervisor Gu there,

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.020
it's the same.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.540
What do you mean by that?

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.300
Is their presence enough?

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.210
- I...
- We don't deserve the banquet?

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.540
Supervisor Gu is also there?

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.400
Yes.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.770
General Wei and Supervisor Gu

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.110
are having a great time drinking.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.680
It seems they will come back late.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.680
Understood.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.620
You may leave now.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.050
Yes.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.210
Wenchang,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:58.880
drinking can cause trouble.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:00.820
Remember what General Wei told you?

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.100
(Always Diligent)

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.160
General Wei, you don't have

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.720
any important matters tomorrow, right?

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.780
Today,

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.860
let's just enjoy

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.060
the wine.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.310
I especially brought

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.170
all this fine wine for you.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.650
You set up this banquet

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.370
to reconcile

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.650
between me and Supervisor Gu.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.220
The drink just now

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:29.430
is enough to show my respect.

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:31.040
Today, there's a change of guard.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.300
I'll go check it out.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.400
Goodbye.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.340
General Wei,

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.850
you've just had one drink.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.750
Wouldn't it be a waste

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.930
of all this delicious food?

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.610
Leave the change of guard

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.340
to the subordinates.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.210
Rest assured.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:48.450
Sit down

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.410
and continue

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.530
to drink.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.780
I'll keep your reminder

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.260
in mind.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.130
What do you mean, Mr. Xu?

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.270
Supervisor Gu,

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.150
I've already helped you get

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.220
the favorable timing and location
that you wanted.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.880
The mind-numbing powder

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.100
he drank has also taken effect.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.580
If you really hate him,

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.580
now is the best chance.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.180
Gu Chusheng,

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.580
you want to kill me?

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.450
Supervisor Gu,

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.170
what are you waiting for?

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.740
Do you really think

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.060
you can kill me?

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.450
Wei Yun,

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:03.100
blame yourself.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.610
Among so many women in the world,

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.060
you had to fall for Chu Yu.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.820
Only if you die

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.210
can Yu possibly come back to me.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.900
Gu Chusheng,

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.160
she has no more feelings

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.240
for you now.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.450
You know it in your heart.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.100
You want to kill me

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.540
just because you can't face this fact,

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.210
and you dare not admit

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:31.830
that your weighing of pros and cons

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:32.770
was wrong.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:34.860
Gu Chusheng,

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.400
you are a coward.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.340
Shut up!

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.350
You're on the brink of death,

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.650
yet you're still defiant.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.930
You can't move, can you?

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.540
I'll send you on your way.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.340
Supervisor Gu,

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.820
this is your last chance.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.690
You have no way out.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.140
Wei Yun is dead.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.860
Wei Yun is dead!

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.000
Let go.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.040
Let go.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.250
Mr. Xu,

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.090
aren't you going to kill him?

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.310
Kill him.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:57.350
Kill him.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.180
Xu Lingzhang,

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:02.540
why are you helping
Gu Chusheng kill me?

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.100
General Wei,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.920
since you're on the brink of death,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.920
I don't need

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.130
to hide it anymore.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.790
I'm not helping him,

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.650
but using his hand to kill you.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.140
But remember:

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.850
You won't be alone on the path to death,

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.410
because now

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.300
I'll kill

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:32.930
both of you.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.130
You used me.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.550
Don't blame me.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.790
It's your fault to be

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.300
the people of Great Sui

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.540
in Qingzhou right now.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.340
Qingzhou

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.610
belongs to me.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.400
Anyone who tries to get their hands

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.890
on Qingzhou is my enemy.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.210
What I've always wanted

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.680
is not to be the Military Governor

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.270
of Qingzhou

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.020
but the ruler of Qingzhou.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:06.770
Don't be afraid.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.060
For helping me hurt him,

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.130
I'll give you a quick death.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.410
You weren't poisoned?

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.020
Why were you stabbed?

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:40.590
To reveal your true face,

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.650
this stab

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.340
is worth it.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:52.540
So,

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.300
you knew it all along.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:56.720
This playacting

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.080
has been quite exhausting for me.

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.240
Before today,

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.450
I couldn't be sure.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.580
Thank you, Mr. Xu,

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.610
for confirming the truth.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:08.690
Xu Lingzhang,

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:10.500
you can kill one or two people,

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.370
but you can't kill ten or a hundred.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.620
Surrender now,

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.470
and I'll leave your body intact.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.580
The outcome is still uncertain.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:28.260
Don't be too happy too soon.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.210
Outside this yamen,

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:34.200
it's already my world.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.610
Mr. Xu, you can go out and see

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.410
if Qingzhou

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.070
is still

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.450
your world now.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.210
It can't be.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.650
This is impossible.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.860
Mr. Xu.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:30.510
Your leader

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.610
has become a prisoner.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.030
Why

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:33.970
don't you surrender?

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.180
(Rule with Virtue)

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.070
Even if he had told you in advance

00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.500
that today was a trap,

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.880
how did you know

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.550
about the soldiers

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.170
I had hidden in the city?

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.980
When I was looking through

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.550
the sealed case files,

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.020
I found a secret passage
in Qingzhou City

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.120
that leads directly into the city

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:15.930
from outside.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.960
Charge!

00:32:55.060 --> 00:33:01.840
Charge!

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.780
There must be a traitor by my side.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.340
Mr. Xu,

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.550
with your intelligence,

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:21.920
you should've guessed it already.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.580
The Emperor sent us here

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.820
because he sensed your disloyalty.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.660
What we know

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.780
is more

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.020
than just the hidden soldiers.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.960
Xu Lingzhang, you've been

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.980
embezzling taxes.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.370
If there's a traitor,

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.930
it's you, who has betrayed Great Sui.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.300
You two

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.510
had grievances,

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.580
yet you joined forces
to come against me.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.930
Can you say

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.690
that this isn't also
for personal revenge?

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.260
Personal revenge?

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.510
What I've been doing is

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:55.300
for Great Sui and its people.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:57.240
Even if there are disagreements

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.210
between us,

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.780
the swords in our hands

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.890
will only face the real enemies.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.780
You've won,

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.410
but remember:

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.360
You've only

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.020
preserved Qingzhou today.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.060
The real victory

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.420
has yet to be decided.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.180
(Sui)

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.800
I wanted to save some effort

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.020
and use Xu Lingzhang to kill Wei Yun.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.510
But I didn't expect him

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:44.900
to be so useless.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.010
Forget it.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.730
Let's stick to the original plan.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.970
Yes.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:52.440
When will Commander Gao,

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.380
sent by Su Can, arrive?

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:54.650
No later than tomorrow.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.690
Qingzhou is full of Su Can's troops.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.150
Princess Yunyang ordered me

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.420
to work with him in Qingzhou,

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.900
but he only gave me a commander.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:10.630
It seems that tomorrow

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:11.920
I will have to spend some time

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.980
dealing with fools like Commander Gao.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:19.020
(Qingzhou Yamen)

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.300
Supervisor Gu,

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.610
you were too harsh.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.800
It was just acting.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.770
Why take it so seriously?

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.330
How do you know
I'm not seeking personal revenge?

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.100
I just regret that this knife

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.730
didn't go in deep enough.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.690
You won't.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.580
I saved you that day,

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.130
so today in Qingzhou,

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.380
you won't kill me.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:53.490
What?

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.030
Do you think

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.020
I'm returning a favor?

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.450
It's not a favor.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:00.530
It's justice.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:02.640
It's justice for you
to capture Xu Lingzhang,

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:03.650
and it's also justice

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.170
for you to protect me.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.980
Gu Chusheng, I said

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.980
you are a good official.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.610
Does that mean

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.610
I can't kill you?

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.420
North Qi is stirring,

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.100
and a big war is imminent.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.340
Without me,

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:24.690
Great Sui will lose a fierce general.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:27.450
Wei Yun,

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.960
you are

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.980
overestimating yourself.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.650
The world can do without anyone.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.250
Great Sui is not short of people,

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.860
but it lacks

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.460
useful people.

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.460
Both civil and military talents

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.980
are essential.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.540
I have never looked down on you,

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.500
nor will I underestimate myself.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.460
What matters, and what doesn't?

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.420
My life doesn't matter;

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.210
the realm matters.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.740
Wei Yun,

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.650
it's not your time to die.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.550
From what I know of Xu Lingzhang,

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.710
what he said just now

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:15.730
seems a bit suspicious.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.080
To avoid future troubles,

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.540
I'll go and interrogate him.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.980
So, you were just pretending,

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:33.650
showing off in front of Supervisor Gu?

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.070
If I stab you,

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:38.170
will it hurt?

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.980
Do you really think I'm made of iron?

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.840
Alright, alright.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.880
No need for more talk.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.490
Hurry up and find a physician.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.340
Let's go.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:06.510
General,

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:07.850
Commander Lu sent a letter today.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.810
Ms. Chu has rushed to Fengling City.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.980
She should be there by now.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.820
(Sui)

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.500
(Even this bell)

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.420
(is going to leave me, too.)

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.780
(Fengling City)

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.060
Last time,

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.020
we suffered a crushing defeat.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.260
We held our ground.

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:32.980
It's not a complete defeat.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:34.590
Otherwise, Fengling

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.020
would've been North Qi's territory.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.130
Linyang,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.380
you like Tuantuan, right?

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.610
I wonder when Commander Lu

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.290
will come back.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.730
Linyang, you've gone bad.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.710
You know how to change the subject now.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.780
Answer me.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.680
Fine, I won't tease you anymore.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.650
Let's get down to business.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.300
Yu,

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.280
there was a blood-red plum blossom

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.500
in the Eldest Princess's room,

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.440
and the phoenix hairpin

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.610
was also found near Fengling.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:27.290
Does this mean

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.900
that there might be

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.730
a North Qi stronghold near Fengling?

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.820
Most likely.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:36.210
Wei Yun suspects the Eldest Princess,

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:38.010
but you don't?

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.450
She wouldn't.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.810
She would never do

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.210
anything to betray Great Sui.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.780
Unless

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:49.380
she was bewitched by Xue Hanmei.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.940
I've also sent scouts

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.420
to search in a wider area.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.510
Commander Lu will come back

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.600
as soon as he has any news.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.820
Don't worry too much.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:02.820
It seems

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.560
that a battle with North Qi

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:05.610
is inevitable.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.260
We need to strengthen

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:10.500
the defense of Fengling.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.860
(Qingzhou Yamen)

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:18.820
General Wei,

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.190
you are not fully recovered.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.130
Leave the patrol

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:22.900
to Wenchang and me.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.300
Don't worry.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.170
Yu gave me the best wound medicine.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.220
It's the war drum.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:32.190
Judging by the direction,

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.680
it seems to be from the south.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:35.130
General,

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:37.160
North Qi has gathered
tens of thousands of troops.

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:38.210
They're already here.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.370
Xu Lingzhang's rebellion
has just been suppressed,

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:42.940
and North Qi sends an army.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.300
The timing

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.980
is just too coincidental.

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:47.560
I'm afraid it's not a coincidence.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:49.130
As for the reason,

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.420
we'll see when we get there.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:57.500
(Qingzhou City)

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:58.450
Yun,

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.840
how could it be Shen You?

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.860
(Qingzhou)

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.880
This is the garrison map

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.100
of North Qi sent by the scout.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.870
- Wei Qiu.
- Yes.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.140
(Main camp: 10,000)
Strengthen

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:18.390
(Northwest: 2,000)
these areas.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.280
Yes.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.220
I will arrange it now.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:27.650
Pass on my order.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:29.170
The entire army is on alert.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.380
Get ready for battle.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:31.610
Yes.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:36.400
Wait.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.360
Why?

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.300
Why aren't we fighting?

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:39.760
The positions and the number

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.410
of soldiers on this map
are too detailed.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.910
If North Qi really intends to attack,

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:44.610
why would they let us know?

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.050
Why would they do this?

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.060
They are reminding us

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.510
that even if we have dealt
with Xu Lingzhang,

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.070
the real danger in Qingzhou

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.010
has not passed.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:55.490
North Qi

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.590
is probably playing

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.610
a much bigger game.
