Why is it raining?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.070
And hailing?

It's me.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.120
Look at you.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.380
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.730
You're soaked through.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.320
It breaks my heart.

Don't do that.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.550
Someone might come in and see us.

Have you forgotten?

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.470
The first time we confessed to each other

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.310

I have a husband.

You know that.

Getting hit by hail really hurts!

to someone else.

I do have premature white hair,

Then why are you in my house?

A what?

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.250
A house-squatter.

Someone who slips into a house
when the owners are out

sometimes at night,

but we never steal.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.560
And we always leave

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.750
before the owner returns.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.040
It's just that today you came home early,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.050
so you caught me.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.070
So you even know when I come home?

Of course.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.160
I went inside.

His name is Zhang San.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.440
He sells mutton soup in this district.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.370
He was quite successful years ago.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.110
But then,

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.360
he fell on hard times.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.280
Actually,

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.960
he's nothing but a scoundrel,

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.310
extremely cunning.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.590
Often when he does something evil,

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.000
he makes sure
the county office doesn't catch him,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.240
and always escapes punishment.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.000
In short,

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.540
he's no decent man.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.720
But why did he end up dead

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.920
in Meng Buyi's house?

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.640
Well...

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.400
I don't know.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.680
I heard Secretary Meng has been

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.440
on night duty at the county office
recently.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.680
But the body

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.030
was discovered long ago,

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.070
and we still haven't seen

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.270
any sign of Meng's wife,

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.270
Hongyao.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.850
Hongyao?

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.680
The woman who played the pipa

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.280
when we were handling the case
in the district.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.760
Excuse me!

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.550
Excuse me!

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.740
Who died?

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.070
What's that question?

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.240
Someone died at Meng's house.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.200
If not Secretary Meng,

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.160
then it must be Hongyao.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.930
Hongyao?

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.440
So who actually died?

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.860
It must be Hongyao.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.110
Isn't there a saying,

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.720
"Hongyao is short-lived?"

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.310
"Hongyao is short-lived?"

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.880
That saying is "beauties are short-lived."

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.830
You old fool know nothing

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:55.790
and talk nonsense.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.400
Excuse us.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.350
Who says
that if someone in the Meng family dies,

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.310
it has to be Secretary Meng

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.970
or Hongyao?

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.240
It could be a burglar.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.270
See? Even a coroner is here.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.400
That makes sense.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.270
Mr. Su,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.170
you're here.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.920
Who is the deceased?

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.960
He's not the homeowner.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.960
He's an outsider.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.200
What took you so long?

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.270
My horse...

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.080
was slow.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.440
The body hasn't been moved, has it?

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:23.680
Of course not.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.950
[Autopsy Record]

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.010
Take notes.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.270
The deceased
likely died around midnight last night.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.790
There's a sharp cut
on the side of his neck,

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.070
enough to be fatal.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.480
The blade wasn't the murder weapon.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.750
The wound is very small.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.200
Judging by its shape,

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.200
it was probably made by scissors

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.530
or a similar sharp tool.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.850
He has bruises on his face...

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.010
and clear strangulation marks on his neck.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:14.640
However,

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.750
they weren't caused by a rope.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.880
What happened?

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.540
I heard someone died in there.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.700
Make way! Make way!

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.350
What happened?

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.070
Secretary Meng,

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.110
there's been a death in your house.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.310
Go in and take a look!

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.480
Hongyao!

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.750
Hongyao!

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.750
Why did Secretary Meng only come back now?

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:42.280
Hongyao!

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:43.080
Hongyao!

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:43.960
Hongyao!

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.310
Stop!

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.340
It's...

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.030
Mr. Guang,

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.160
where is my Hongyao?

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.750
I haven't seen your wife.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.910
I'm Lu Lingfeng,
Yongzhou Judicial Official.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.670
Greetings, Official Lu.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.070
Secretary Meng,
when do you usually return home

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.720
after your night duty?

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.000
I...

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.500
I usually...

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.400
get home around nine in the morning.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.550
But today, after I left the county office,

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.920
I went to the Ghost Market.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.560
The Ghost Market? What for?

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.960
Recently,

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.270
I've been writing a strange tale.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.430
Since it involves spirits and ghosts,

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.680
I feared it might harm my yang energy.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.480
I heard that

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.790
the Yangzhou Liuhe paper
sold at the Ghost Market

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.110
has exorcising properties

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.570
that keep all ghosts away,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.140
so I went to look for it.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.460
Did you find it?

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.200
No.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.820
If you ever find it,

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:36.790
let me know

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.240
where to buy it. I want some too.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.900
You also write strange tales?

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.170
Have you published anything?

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:43.770
Which bookstore sells them?

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:49.440
Secretary Meng,

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.940
did you go home last night?

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.200
No.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.510
Is there anyone who can verify that?

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.110
Lately, it's just been me

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.000
in the little hall where I work.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.660
No one else has been there.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.410
The senior clerk can vouch for me.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.350
Last night,

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.510
I had a drink with him.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.240
He knows I've been writing
a strange tale recently

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.440
and has been telling me
snake demon stories

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.570
these past few days.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.650
Snake demon stories?

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.830
Who...

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.120
Who is this person?

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:18.290
This...

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:18.970
Zhang San.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.510
Zhang San?

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.750
What does...

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:22.680
What does he do?

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.280
Why did he die in my house?

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.160
Secretary Meng,
you don't know this person?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:27.640
I...

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.310
He's the one who sells mutton soup
in our district.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.680
How would I know

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.680
a mutton soup vendor?

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.350
I just want to know

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.480
where my wife is.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.920
Could she have gone back
to her maternal family?

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.650
Impossible.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.590
She's not even from Chang'an.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.270
She doesn't really have a maternal family.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.790
Secretary Meng, how did you and your wife

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:43.880
first meet?

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.830
When we met, she was a pipa player

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:46.560
at a brothel.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.310
Later, after I passed the imperial exam

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.110
and joined the county office,

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:50.070
I took her out of there.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.350
Then we got married.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.440
Secretary Meng,
you often work night shifts

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.780
and write strange tales.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.080
It must have taken
a lot of your mental effort.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.210
I hope it hasn't turned your hair white
from exhaustion.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.750
My hair?

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:09.510
Well...

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.920
My hair is perfectly fine.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.590
Look, not a single white hair.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.410
What about your lady, Hongyao?

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.070
A few days ago, I saw her when I came

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.330
to Qinglong District.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.030
However,

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.080
I didn't see her clearly.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.330
Her? That's even more impossible.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.400
She's so young,

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.110
and her hair

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.540
is black and silky.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.400
Then how do you explain this?

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.370
I found it during my routine inspection
just now.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.880
What is it?

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.160
Whose white hair

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.840
could have fallen onto my bed?

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:45.920
It's...

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:48.880
It's...

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:52.550
Who says
that if someone in the Meng family dies,

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.440
it has to be Secretary Meng

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.150
or Hongyao?

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.720
It could be a burglar.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.660
Someone's coming out.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.780
Excuse me, sir,

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.660
is the deceased

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:13.830
Hongyao?

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.440
You know Meng's wife?

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.000
I...

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.160
don't know her.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.000
I'm just curious.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.510
No comment.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.310
Is it Hongyao or not?

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.420
Earlier, there was a young man

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.270
with a head full of white hair.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.440
Do you remember him?

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.110
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.660
He was quite talkative.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.760
Find him

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.350
and bring him to the county office.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.950
Yes.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.290
There's someone outside.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.730
Keep an eye on him for me.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:01.790
Jia,

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.880
you can move the body back
to the county office

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.240
and store it in the ice chamber now.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.040
But remember,

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.200
cover it with a white cloth
when carrying it out.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:11.960
Don't let anyone know

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.720
the identity of the deceased.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.270
Yes.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.130
Secretary Meng.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:21.200
And you.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.970
You two must keep this confidential
as well.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.920
Xue Huan,

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.590
search every corner

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.200
of the Meng Residence with me

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.160
and see if there are any sharp tools,

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.680
such as scissors.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:34.790
Yes, sir.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:37.790
This...

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:40.590
Official Lu.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.110
What about my wife?

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.000
You must help me find my wife!

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.240
We can't confirm

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.440
that your wife is missing.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.430
If by nightfall
we still don't know her whereabouts,

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:51.430
the county office
will send people to search for her.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.990
However,

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.790
I would like to ask you

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.140
to provide more clues.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:56.110
For instance,

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.330
have you and your wife

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.020
had any arguments recently?

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.050
No, no, no.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.190
We haven't argued.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.100
Do you have any other clues?

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:04.830
Other clues?

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:05.920
There are none.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.880
Official Lu,

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.110
you're a crime investigator.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.110
My wife is missing,

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.840
and you're asking me for clues?

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.070
What clues could I possibly have?

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.280
And I have to wait until night.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.110
What if some bad guy

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.000
kills my wife?

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.080
Official Lu,

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.550
I...

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.700
You can't just stand by and do nothing.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:24.920
[Integrity] [Loyalty]

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.830
Mr. Su speculated that Zhang San died

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.830
from the scissors wound on his neck.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:29.680
But we searched

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.600
the entire Meng Residence

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.860
and found no scissors.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.570
That's very strange.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.240
So I roughly conclude

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.310
that at the time, Zhang San

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.480
was likely hiding in the cabinet

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.410
with ill intent.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.680
Hongyao discovered him

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.480
and stabbed him to death with scissors.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.460
After killing him,

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.110
Hongyao didn't dare report it,

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:46.770
so she fled with the scissors.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:49.920
How's

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.580
Captain Xue's deduction?

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.020
It makes sense.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.270
But how do you explain

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.910
the knife found on the floor?

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.070
Judging by where it landed,

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.260
it should have been held by Zhang San.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.160
Perhaps Hongyao caught him off guard,

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.140
so he didn't get to use his knife.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.750
The sudden strength of a woman

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.480
shouldn't be underestimated.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.920
Then how do we explain

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.350
the two white hairs

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.510
Official Lu found?

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.820
Perhaps

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.590
they were left a long time ago.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.030
We can

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.440
ask Meng Buyi more carefully

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.030
whether an elderly person

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.770
had stayed in the house a month ago,

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.570
or even six months ago.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.310
Zhang San had bruises on his face,

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.780
which indicate he was strangled.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.440
This should be related to

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.680
the marks on his neck.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.360
But these marks are very strange.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.350
They weren't caused by rope,

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.680
cloth,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.790
or any weapon.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:45.970
Then tell me,

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.400
was Zhang San

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.290
strangled to death

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.480
or stabbed to death with scissors?

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.720
Or perhaps both?

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.070
If so, which happened first?

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.550
And which was more fatal?

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.620
How can we determine that?

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.150
Did you learn anything?

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.440
Yes, I did.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.400
Mr. Su is impressive.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:12.000
So what should we do now?

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.010
Let's wait until we can catch him
and interrogate him.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:17.510
You didn't tell me to arrest anyone.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.540
Liu and Luo have both disappeared.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.830
And the secret agent Yingtao
has been sent out too.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.030
Haven't you noticed?

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.260
Catching someone without any leads?

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.070
Who?

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.750
Silly boy.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.510
It's not that there are no leads.

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.310
You just haven't found them yet.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.640
Watch Su Wuming closely

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.700
and learn from him.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:38.220
Xue Huan,

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.090
you are Official Lu's apprentice.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.230
Learn more from your mentor.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.030
Yes.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:47.890
Mr. Su,

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.110
may I ask,

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.080
who have they gone to arrest?

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.270
Who is it?

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.310
The hair

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.790
is indeed mine.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.480
I stayed at the Meng Residence
for half a month.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.940
I didn't clean up properly when I left

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.200
and actually left behind some of my hair.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.720
Truly embarrassing for us house-squatters.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.310
House-squatter?

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.640
Can giving yourself

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.070
such an elegant name

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.790
really make you different from a thief?

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.110
If you see something

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.010
you like,

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.310
you would probably just help yourself,
right?

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.610
Absolutely not.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.160
Otherwise, wouldn't it tarnish

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.750
the reputation of our line of work?

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:48.700
Official Lu.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.920
Chang'an

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:52.510
really does have
so-called house-squatters.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.850
Most of them are homeless and jobless.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.630
A few have homes and jobs,

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.520
but, due to some eccentricity,

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.240
choose to sneak into
other people's houses to live.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.750
That's a different matter.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.350
You-you really know your stuff.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.480
Are you also a...

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.680
Let me ask you.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.860
When was the last time

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.020
you stayed at the Meng Residence?

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.250
Three days ago.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.110
It was hailing that day.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:18.460
Hongyao came back early,

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.000
so she caught me in the room.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.750
Who are you?

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.970
You're a thief!

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.660
A white-haired thief.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:26.360
Please don't report me.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.760
I'll do whatever you ask.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.160
But Zhang San's death

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.890
truly has nothing to do with me.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.700
When did I ever say

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.400
the deceased was Zhang San?

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:47.310
Jiang,

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.830
confess everything now!

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:49.430
I'll talk!

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:51.010
I'll tell you everything!

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:53.550
A silver ingot?

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.680
There's another one

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:56.750
after the job is done.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.830
Who do you... want me to kill?

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.600
The one who sells mutton soup
in the district,

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:02.550
Zhang San.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.350
Hongyao asked you to kill Zhang San?

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.160
Yes.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.440
But now that Zhang San is dead,

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.960
I can't explain myself.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.400
Jiang,

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.270
if you didn't kill him,

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.680
Official Lu wouldn't wrongly accuse you.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:19.590
But you must tell us

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:20.830
everything you know

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:22.160
and everything you saw.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:23.920
You must not hide anything.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:25.480
Yes.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.680
Let me ask you.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.610
After taking the silver ingot
from Hongyao,

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.510
did you kill Zhang San?

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.900
I've never killed anyone.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.310
And I don't even know how.

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:35.640
I hesitated for 3 days

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.820
and then found a butcher's knife.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:38.830
But the moment I saw Zhang San,

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:39.560
I got scared.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:41.630
I didn't dare kill him directly.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:42.880
So I thought

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:44.240
I'd sound him out first

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.320
and figure out

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.010
what exactly he did to offend Hongyao.

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:47.160
[Zhang's Mutton Soup]

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:47.920
Take care.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.490
Alright.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.440
San!

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.130
I'm here to help.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:54.960
You brat, whose house

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.320
have you been sleeping comfortably in
this time?

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.080
No one's.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:58.960
Lately I've had nowhere to sleep

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.020
and nothing to eat.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.000
San,

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.600
do you need any help here?

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:03.310
Wait.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:03.440
San?

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.350
[Zhang's Mutton Soup]

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.680
Who are you to call me San?

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.730
You should call me Mr. San!

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.600
You're carrying a knife?

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.660
You've grown bold?

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.000
Are you done being a house-squatter

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.270
and now turning into an assassin?

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:21.240
N-no...

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.100
Then why are you carrying a knife?

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.200
If you're an assassin,

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.590
someone must have paid you a deposit.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.390
Let me see how much they gave you.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:32.690
A silver ingot?

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.610
You really are an assassin now?

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.640
H-how would I have the guts,

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.330
Mr. San?

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.480
Don't... don't you know me?

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.580
Where did the money come from?

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.110
Speak!

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.610
I'll kill you if you don't tell me!

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.290
I didn't dare tell Zhang San

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.190
that Hongyao sent me to kill him,

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.350
so I could only say

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.110
I borrowed it
while staying at Hongyao's house.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:50.880
Borrowed?

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.180
We house-squatters sometimes steal things

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.510
under special circumstances.

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:56.550
But we don't call it stealing.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:57.310
We call it borrowing,

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:58.920
which means that if we ever become
successful one day,

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.880
we'll return to stay

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.880
and sneak it back.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.650
But as far as I know,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.350
no one has ever returned anything,

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.750
because no one has ever become successful.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:10.670
What about the silver?

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.760
He took it.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.550
He actually grabbed my silver.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.810
It was so humiliating.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.480
At that moment,
I really wanted to kill him.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.810
But he took my knife too.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.590
So I had no choice
but to follow him secretly.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.449
Then I found out

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.449
he went to Hongyao's house.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.000
He must have gone there to steal silver.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.070
I know him too well.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.030
At that time, I thought,

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.320
I definitely couldn't beat him,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.580
but I could ambush him.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.000
I planned to wait until he came out,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.130
catch him off guard,

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.590
and kill him with a stone.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.260
Then I could keep

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.420
the silver he stole

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:00.280
and go to Hongyao

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.880
to get the other silver ingot.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.400
That way

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.930
I, Jiang, would be rich

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.710
and never have to be

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.110
a house-squatter again.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.670
However,

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.780
before Zhang San came out,

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.190
I saw...

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.330
What did you see?

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.650
I saw Secretary Meng come back.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.000
Meng Buyi?

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.800
You know him?

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:19.600
Of course.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.030
As house-squatters,

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.800
we always have to figure out

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.000
who the homeowner is.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.390
Meng Buyi went home last night?

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.110
Yes, he did.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.160
But he was acting quite strange.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.760
Strange how?

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:03.320
What happened next?

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:04.480
Later,

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.110
I heard someone knocking on the door.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.550
Not long after that,

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.020
Meng Buyi came out.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.480
He was carrying a roll of paper.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.210
He climbed over the wall again?

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:15.190
No.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.560
He came out through the door.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.150
And then

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.670
something even stranger happened.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:22.480
But honestly,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.420
I shouldn't tell you this.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.030
After all, Hongyao was the first person

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.280
who ever gave me a silver ingot.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.150
If you hide anything...

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.150
I dare not!

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.960
At this point,

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:34.210
I can only let Hongyao down. Wait.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.670
Wait.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:51.960
Did you say that when Meng Buyi left,

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.960
he didn't close his door completely

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.610
and left a small gap?

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.120
And Hongyao didn't come out to close it?

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.480
No.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.190
I hesitated then.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.030
Was that bastard Zhang San

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:06.360
not there to steal?

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.190
Could he actually be Hongyao's lover?

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.230
That would really be a flower

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:12.230
stuck in cow dung.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.740
Zhang San's character

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.130
is even worse than mine.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.510
You're getting off track.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:19.360
Just tell us what you saw.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.120
Right, right. Seeing is believing.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:25.510
About 30 minutes later...

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:29.810
Let's go.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.110
He was lying on the ground?

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.230
Was he injured?

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:02.760
No.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.630
Did you see it clearly
from outside the window?

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:06.920
I may have premature white hair,

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.670
but my eyesight is perfectly fine.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.470
He really had no injuries on him.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.630
Bold Jiang!

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:12.920
To take back the silver ingot

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:13.920
Hongyao gave you,

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.270
you rushed into the house

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:17.270
and killed Zhang San with scissors!

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.070
No, no!

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.070
You're still trying to deny it?

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.470
Do you want to experience

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.150
Yongzhou Prefecture Office's
severe punishment?

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.960
Sir,

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.840
you look even younger than me.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.000
Why are you so impatient?

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.400
You...

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:28.150
Can't you just

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:29.410
let me finish talking?

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:34.630
As you said,

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.250
I did have that thought.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.420
But before I could enter the house...

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.320
Hongyao?

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:24.710
It was Hongyao?

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.670
Jiang,

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.320
do you know this is

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.150
the West Hall
of Yongzhou Prefecture Office?

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.800
Lying here is considered

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.260
as serious a crime as murder and plunder.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.550
I dare not hide anything!

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:36.810
I'm telling the truth.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.880
I swear on my honor

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.960
as a house-squatter.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.030
Your honor as a house-squatter

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.960
is worthless.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:43.320
If I discover during the investigation

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.140
that you've concealed anything

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:47.430
or deliberately fabricated anything,

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:50.190
your punishment will be increased.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.990
Take him down!

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:51.940
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.440
Jia.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:57.150
Yes?

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:58.480
Hurry up and invite Miss Xijun

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.670
to Qinglong District.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.070
Have her make a portrait
of Hongyao based on

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:03.360
the descriptions of the district head
and the neighbors.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:03.800
Yes.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.230
Secretary Meng returned home last night,

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:10.480
yet he deliberately hid it.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.710
There must be something suspicious.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:12.440
Official Lu,

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.510
what should we do?

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.440
Ask Su Wuming.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:21.830
Mr. Su, what should we do?

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.360
Meng Buyi is indeed suspicious.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:29.120
But we shouldn't alert him.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.960
Here's what we'll do.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:33.110
Keep watch on him in secret.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.730
Hu Shentong!

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:57.400
Sirs,

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.030
has anyone seen Hu Shentong?

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.490
Didn't he take your job?

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:05.230
He left early to kill.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:08.390
You remember me?

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.310
Of course.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:12.720
I can remember

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.760
everyone who hires Assassin Hu.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.580
What's wrong?

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.510
You want to back out?

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.510
You want to take back your deposit?

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.960
No.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:19.450
Dream on.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:20.720
Deposits are non-refundable.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.510
That's the rule in Assassin Street.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:23.710
I'm not here to get my money back.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:24.280
I...

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.290
I have another job.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.630
Who wants to take it?

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:29.630
Who's the target?

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:31.110
It's not a kill job this time.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:31.630
I...

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.280
want you to find someone.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.290
Find someone?

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.030
And you came to Assassin Street for that?

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:37.190
Are you messing with us?

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:38.860
You're insulting us assassins!

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.320
Sir, sir.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.050
-I'll kill you!
-Don't get me wrong.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:41.670
Don't get me wrong.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:42.710
Let me put it this way—

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.230
say

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.840
I want to kill my enemy,

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.710
but I don't know

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.360
where he is right now. What...

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.350
What should I do?

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.090
Of course, you should find him first,

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.970
then kill him.

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.620
Exactly!

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:54.110
So...

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.880
I just want you to

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.480
do the first step.

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.880
How is that

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.190
messing with you?

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.620
Who do you want to find?

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:05.310
I can't tell you yet.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.230
For just the first step,

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:07.600
how much...

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.930
would you charge me?

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.670
At least half.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.030
Come on,

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:14.110
half isn't reasonable.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.230
Finding someone should be cheaper
than killing them.

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:17.320
I think at most...

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:19.280
20 percent.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:20.840
No way.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.560
What about 25 percent?

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.230
I can't go any higher. And...

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.960
it should be based on the price

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.000
Hu Shentong and I agreed on.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:27.860
How about that?

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.960
I...

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.900
-Are you messing with us?
-No, no, no.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:33.490
I'll kill you!

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:39.290
Who are you?

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:40.720
Mind your own business!

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.370
Just a boy?

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.440
Move!

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.030
[Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.710
I'm a captain
of Yongzhou Prefecture Office,

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:49.480
Xue Huan!

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:51.820
He's...

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:53.440
He's an official.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:54.590
Let's go.

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:55.160
Let's go.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.550
Let's go.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.120
Let me borrow this.
