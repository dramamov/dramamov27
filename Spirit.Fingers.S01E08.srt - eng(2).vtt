Yeah, that's probably it.

00:05:59.136 --> 00:06:01.692

Not at all.

00:06:15.533 --> 00:06:18.304
I'm just making faces to match the makeup.

00:06:18.304 --> 00:06:21.200
Oh right, that smile now suits you well.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.867

Geu Rin, it looks really real.

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:42.100
It looks creepy and scary, right?

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.533
You don't want to see it again, huh?

00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:45.367
Cute

00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:48.733

00:06:48.733 --> 00:06:50.467
Huh?

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.100
Wait.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.600
Did he always smile like that?

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.467
Yeah, I usually smile like this.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.833
Come on, just give in already.

00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:09.400
What do you mean?

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.400
Ah, why isn't he coming? What's he up to again?

00:07:16.033 --> 00:07:17.100
Nam Gi Jeong.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.267
Alright, shall we get ready for croquis?

00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:20.567
I'll go to the restroom real quick.

00:07:20.567 --> 00:07:23.233
I wonder what look the model
will show up with today.

00:07:23.233 --> 00:07:25.433
Right, he makes me look forward to it every time.

00:07:25.433 --> 00:07:27.367
He'll have to do more than a Harley Quinn costume.

00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:29.833
That was seriously shocking back then.

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:31.533
Can I take out my contact lenses?

00:07:31.533 --> 00:07:34.667
I can't see as well as I thought.
And the room is dark.

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:37.000
Stick to the concept, Khaki.

00:07:43.552 --> 00:07:44.933
- Mister.
- Huh?

00:07:44.933 --> 00:07:47.733
This is my first time doing croquis.

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:49.300
Could you teach me?

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.567
Oh, really?

00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:53.133
Did you bring a croquis book?

00:07:53.133 --> 00:07:55.033
No.

00:08:31.808 --> 00:08:33.632
What? You're not scared?

00:08:33.632 --> 00:08:35.400
No, not really.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.067
I might just bite you.

00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:38.267
I'm a vampire, you know?

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:40.000
So?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
What now?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.216
Hey.

00:08:45.216 --> 00:08:48.133
- What's wrong?
- Gi Jeong?

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.700
Hey, Gi Jeong.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.100
Ahn Ye Rim? Why are you here?

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.464
She's my guest.

00:08:58.464 --> 00:09:00.700
What?

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.667
Yeah, I came as U Yeon's guest.

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:06.800
She's the person you wanted to bring?

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.100
Yeah.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.100
A word with you.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.667
You two know each other? Since when?

00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:19.648
How? Why?

00:09:19.648 --> 00:09:21.767
We just met by chance recently.

00:09:21.767 --> 00:09:23.367
She helped me when I was in trouble.

00:09:23.367 --> 00:09:25.100
I invited her here to return the favor.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.800
By chance?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.467
Hey, you might not realize it,

00:09:30.467 --> 00:09:33.300
but she's not the type to just run into someone
and help them by chance.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.933
But we did meet by chance.

00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:37.433
And she did help me.

00:09:37.433 --> 00:09:39.500
Be honest.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.100
She said she wanted to come here, right?

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.296
No,

00:09:43.296 --> 00:09:45.500
I invited her.

00:09:47.533 --> 00:09:51.133
Hey, maybe you really don't know,

00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:52.933
but she likes me, so that's why...

00:09:52.933 --> 00:09:55.100
I know.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.608
What?

00:09:56.608 --> 00:09:58.267
You knew?

00:09:58.267 --> 00:10:00.233
I sort of heard about it.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.100
Heard?

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.033
What exactly did you hear?

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.033
Yeah.

00:10:09.033 --> 00:10:12.400
You heard and you know it.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.267
But you don't care?

00:10:14.267 --> 00:10:16.767
Why should I care?

00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:17.833
You don't?

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:19.567
No.

00:10:20.267 --> 00:10:21.633
Not at all.

00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:24.833
Fine. Got it.

00:10:39.296 --> 00:10:41.167
U Yeon.

00:10:43.233 --> 00:10:45.152
Is Gi Jeong

00:10:45.152 --> 00:10:47.533
really mad?

00:10:47.533 --> 00:10:49.600
- No.
- I'm sorry.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.200
I told you not to say anything to him,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.933
but I should've told him earlier.

00:10:53.933 --> 00:10:55.104
It's nothing.

00:10:55.104 --> 00:10:56.833
Let's go in.

00:11:02.208 --> 00:11:05.433
Let's stay out a bit longer.

00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:08.352
You kept saying 'just a little more,'
and two hours have already passed.

00:11:09.533 --> 00:11:12.200
I really don't want to go to the study room.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.533
Then just 30 more minutes, okay?

00:11:14.533 --> 00:11:17.700
Ah, just 30 minutes.

00:11:18.304 --> 00:11:20.032
Jeez.

00:11:20.032 --> 00:11:21.467
Darn it.

00:11:21.467 --> 00:11:23.967
Watch where you're going.

00:11:25.867 --> 00:11:27.267
What's wrong, Song?

00:11:27.267 --> 00:11:29.300
Wait.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.100
Just stay still for a moment.

00:11:33.433 --> 00:11:35.267
So annoying.

00:11:37.233 --> 00:11:38.600
Hey!

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.333
Good to see you guys.

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:43.633
- What?
- Oh, thanks.

00:11:43.633 --> 00:11:46.300
- For showing up here.
- What's this about?

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.300
You know her?

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.500
No.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.267
Who are you? You know me?

00:11:50.267 --> 00:11:51.700
Of course.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.700
Don't you know me?

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.667
Who are you?

00:11:54.667 --> 00:11:57.000
I'm...

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.100
I'm Song U Yeon's bestie, you punks!

00:12:02.112 --> 00:12:03.552
- Let her go!
- Stop!

00:12:03.552 --> 00:12:05.100
Hey!

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.200
Right, time to pick a nickname for our guest.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.600
- Oh, right.
- What color do you like?

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.300
Pardon?

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.533
This is so childish.

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:14.967
I...

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:17.333
White Finger, how about that?

00:12:17.333 --> 00:12:19.133
Matches well with Ye Rim, right?

00:12:19.133 --> 00:12:22.167
Oh, perfect match.

00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:24.967
I like it too.

00:12:31.744 --> 00:12:34.933
Alright, now that the guest is here...

00:12:35.567 --> 00:12:39.433
- Time for 'I Am Ground' introductions!
- Time for 'I Am Ground' introductions!

00:12:39.433 --> 00:12:40.667
Stick to the concept and don't smile.

00:12:40.667 --> 00:12:41.700
Or you'll get punished.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.400
Good.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.633
- Time for 'I Am Ground' introductions!
- Time for 'I Am Ground' introductions!

00:12:47.633 --> 00:12:48.867
What's this?

00:12:48.867 --> 00:12:50.933
They really go overboard.

00:12:50.933 --> 00:12:53.100
You smiled.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.487
- Lie down.
- Lie down.

00:12:56.487 --> 00:12:59.867
- Lie down.
- Lie down.

00:12:59.867 --> 00:13:01.567
- Ye Rim.
- Lie down.

00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:04.000
- U Yeon.
- Lie down.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.867
- Lie down.
- Wait.

00:13:06.867 --> 00:13:08.600
Punishment shield.

00:13:12.267 --> 00:13:14.833
Punishment shield?

00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:17.100
Gi Jeong and Ye Rim know each other.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.008
They are colleagues from the same studio.

00:13:20.864 --> 00:13:23.633
Let's get this over with!

00:13:28.352 --> 00:13:31.067
Indian!

00:13:31.067 --> 00:13:32.267
What are you doing?

00:13:32.267 --> 00:13:36.267
- Indian!
- Indian!

00:13:36.267 --> 00:13:37.440
- Rice!
- Rice!

00:13:39.567 --> 00:13:41.100
Huh? Yeom Se Ra?

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.933
Huh? Oh Dae O?

00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:46.133
Do you study here too? Me too, nice to see you.

00:13:46.133 --> 00:13:49.567
Unlike Poo Gi Jeong and that perv,
you're genuinely cool.

00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:51.100
What's that flower for?

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.667
Oh, this?

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:55.200
Here, take this. I found it on my way here.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.400
Oh, really? But why are you saying it so casually?

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.000
Right. Why am I saying it so casually?

00:14:00.608 --> 00:14:02.216
Jeez.

00:14:02.867 --> 00:14:04.567
Huh?

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.233
Is that a fight?

00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:12.380
Let go! Let go!

00:14:13.804 --> 00:14:15.656
Stop it!

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.672
Darn you!

00:14:28.096 --> 00:14:30.200
Darn, girls fighting...

00:14:32.767 --> 00:14:35.100
Se Ra?

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.233
Se Ra?

00:14:36.233 --> 00:14:38.467
Se Ra!

00:14:38.467 --> 00:14:39.833
Se Ra!

00:14:39.833 --> 00:14:41.467
Are you okay?

00:14:41.467 --> 00:14:42.784
Hey, don't worry, I'm here.

00:14:42.784 --> 00:14:43.872
What?

00:14:43.872 --> 00:14:46.200
Let go while I'm asking nicely.

00:14:54.656 --> 00:14:58.767
You, I won't let this slide!

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.467
Hey! You squid!

00:15:12.867 --> 00:15:16.100
Hey! Oh Dae O! You alright?

00:15:16.767 --> 00:15:19.900
You guys are all done for!

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.280
Three minutes up!

00:15:37.888 --> 00:15:41.024
Maybe it's because of today's dress code,
but everyone drew really well.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:44.500
My brush pen's gliding smoothly too.

00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:48.467
Is that supposed to be me?

00:15:48.467 --> 00:15:50.967
Is this really a drawing club?

00:15:50.967 --> 00:15:53.700
Nobody here can draw properly.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.400
Huh?

00:15:56.533 --> 00:15:59.967
That one's actually not bad.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.100
Your line work's getting cleaner.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.200
Really?

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.900
Yeah.

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:12.767
Right. Couple posing time is back!

00:16:12.767 --> 00:16:14.067
Who's going to do it today?

00:16:14.067 --> 00:16:16.200
Geu Rin and Seon Ho could...

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.367
Nope!

00:16:17.367 --> 00:16:19.800
Hey, don't embarrass me.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.867
I don't wanna do it, either.

00:16:21.867 --> 00:16:24.200
Yeah? Well, that's a relief then.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.933
Don't get all lovey-dovey here.

00:16:25.933 --> 00:16:27.000
What's that supposed to mean?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.667
I hate beans.

00:16:28.667 --> 00:16:30.933
I won't even eat bean rice.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:34.300
Goodness, you hate beans?

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.300
Bean hate? Is this a joke?

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.433
- Well...
- Excuse me...

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.933
Can I give it a try? With Gi Jeong?

00:16:50.784 --> 00:16:56.000
Well, we're both pros,
so we should be able to show you properly.

00:16:58.816 --> 00:17:00.333
Do it.

00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:03.167
Oh, okay.

00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:07.267
Two professional models posing
should be worth watching.

00:17:07.267 --> 00:17:10.033
Right? Right?

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.433
As expected of a pro. They're really bold.

00:17:21.433 --> 00:17:24.067
This makes me actually want to draw.

00:17:24.067 --> 00:17:25.833
Starting now.

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:48.520
Baeblu,

00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:50.300
you're not drawing?

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.033
Pardon?

00:17:55.904 --> 00:17:59.533
I've been like that since I was little.

00:17:59.533 --> 00:18:01.664
A kid who didn't particularly

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:04.133
like or dislike anything.

00:18:08.224 --> 00:18:10.633
Coming here,

00:18:10.633 --> 00:18:14.567
I finally figured out what I like,

00:18:14.567 --> 00:18:16.672
but I still think

00:18:16.672 --> 00:18:19.867
I don't really know what I dislike.

00:18:24.128 --> 00:18:25.933
I hate this.

00:18:28.032 --> 00:18:30.033
I really hate this.

00:18:39.008 --> 00:18:43.233
You're really the worst, Song U Yeon.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.400
- Talk to me.
- Ah, what is this?

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.167
What are you doing?

00:19:11.552 --> 00:19:13.300
Is it the same now?

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.933
You feel nothing about it?

00:19:14.933 --> 00:19:16.867
You still feel that way?

00:19:17.733 --> 00:19:18.967
Yeah.

00:19:18.967 --> 00:19:20.233
You really...

00:19:20.233 --> 00:19:21.867
You're fine with me being that close to her?

00:19:21.867 --> 00:19:23.933
What's that got to do with me?

00:19:23.933 --> 00:19:26.533
It's not like we're dating.

00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:28.233
What?

00:19:35.296 --> 00:19:37.567
Oh, seriously!

00:19:38.592 --> 00:19:41.333
Good work today. Okay.

00:19:42.533 --> 00:19:44.833
I'm really craving kimbap, tteokbokki,
and sundae. It's been so long.

00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:47.033
Oh, right, kimbap, tteokbokki, and sundae.

00:19:47.033 --> 00:19:49.100
Baeblu, are you okay with that?

00:19:50.667 --> 00:19:54.033
Need to rush to the study room?

00:19:54.033 --> 00:19:56.967
Not exactly.

00:19:56.967 --> 00:19:58.767
Hey friend, come with us.

00:19:58.767 --> 00:20:02.467
Yeah, since you're part of us today.

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:04.433
Is that alright?

00:20:04.433 --> 00:20:06.000
Of course.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.033
Thank you for looking out for me.

00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:11.667
I'll just go. My head hurts.

00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:12.833
Hey!

00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:15.333
Oh, that punk.

00:20:15.936 --> 00:20:18.000
He's at it again.

00:20:19.456 --> 00:20:23.367
When we work together,
he keeps saying he has a headache.

00:20:24.433 --> 00:20:25.767
Is he hurting badly?

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:28.633
Huh? He never said anything like that.

00:20:28.633 --> 00:20:31.600
Well, I just notice because I often see him.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.400
Do you see him as often as Geu Rin does?

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.500
What?

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.567
She's Gi Jeong's sister.

00:20:38.733 --> 00:20:40.467
Huh?

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.200
Oh, sorry.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.700
Forgot to mention it.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.900
No need to apologize.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.500
Here, we don't call each other
by titles like sister or brother.

00:20:59.904 --> 00:21:02.233
Ah, then I'll head out first.

00:21:02.233 --> 00:21:04.967
Gotta take care of that punk.

00:21:04.967 --> 00:21:07.392
See you next week.

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.000
Take care of him?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.912
Geu Rin taking care of Gi Jeong?

00:21:12.736 --> 00:21:15.700
I'll get going too.

00:21:20.992 --> 00:21:22.233
Ugh.

00:21:22.233 --> 00:21:25.233
Getting over that hill ain't easy.

00:21:40.096 --> 00:21:44.067
Thanks to you, I feel a bit better with Gi Jeong.

00:21:44.067 --> 00:21:46.800
Thanks for today.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.533
Oh, that's great.

00:21:52.416 --> 00:21:54.667
But U Yeon.

00:21:54.667 --> 00:21:58.167
Can I ask one thing?

00:21:58.167 --> 00:21:59.833
Huh?

00:21:59.833 --> 00:22:01.933
Yeah, what is it?

00:22:01.933 --> 00:22:04.983
This might be weird

00:22:04.983 --> 00:22:07.267
to ask now but,

00:22:07.267 --> 00:22:09.533
U Yeon, by any chance,

00:22:09.533 --> 00:22:13.267
do you like Gi Jeong?

00:22:14.067 --> 00:22:15.767
Huh?

00:22:19.667 --> 00:22:21.567
No.

00:22:21.567 --> 00:22:23.567
Really?

00:22:23.567 --> 00:22:25.700
You two looked so close.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.967
Thought maybe you liked him.

00:22:27.967 --> 00:22:31.267
Then I've been cluelessly stuck between you two.

00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:32.833
It's really not the case, right?

00:22:32.833 --> 00:22:34.700
You're sure?

00:22:35.567 --> 00:22:38.833
No, it's not.

00:22:38.833 --> 00:22:40.667
We're just friends.

00:22:40.667 --> 00:22:43.033
Gi Jeong suggested being friends.

00:22:43.033 --> 00:22:44.267
U Yeon.

00:22:44.267 --> 00:22:47.000
Will you stay friends with me long too?

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.933
I really like you a lot.

00:22:49.933 --> 00:22:53.267
Let's go. I'm getting hungry.

00:22:53.267 --> 00:22:55.400
Let's go.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:00.200
So back then when Gi Jeong
saved you from bullies...

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.712
Now U Yeon got saved by coincidence?

00:23:03.712 --> 00:23:04.768
Is that a dad joke?

00:23:04.768 --> 00:23:06.767
It's a rhyme.

00:23:06.767 --> 00:23:08.933
You got it, right?

00:23:08.933 --> 00:23:11.633
It's not like I actually saved her.

00:23:11.633 --> 00:23:14.633
I was too scared to step in.

00:23:14.633 --> 00:23:17.333
Is it true, Baeblu?

00:23:17.333 --> 00:23:18.944
Huh?

00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:22.267
Oh, right.

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:25.267
If not for Ye Rim, I would've
ended up like a drenched little mouse.

00:23:25.267 --> 00:23:28.533
Ah, so she saved you from hair loss?

00:23:29.376 --> 00:23:34.433
Oh, because it was acid rain, hence hair loss?

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.712
- Is that a joke?
- Hilarious.

00:23:39.712 --> 00:23:40.967
Say something.

00:23:40.967 --> 00:23:42.800
Police station?

00:23:45.984 --> 00:23:49.867
I really put my fighting skills
back in the day against Legend haters to use.

00:23:50.967 --> 00:23:54.080
Hey, fighting isn't the solution.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.233
No, stay seated.

00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:56.267
Anyone hurt?

00:23:56.267 --> 00:23:59.456
Don't worry. I'm fine from head to toe.

00:23:59.456 --> 00:24:00.800
Jeez.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.433
Which police station is it?

00:24:02.433 --> 00:24:04.100
Huh?

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.767
U Yeon! It's just a district outpost,
not a police station.

00:24:06.767 --> 00:24:10.067
Ah, so where exactly is it?

00:24:10.067 --> 00:24:12.967
Why did you call her? You're making her worry.

00:24:12.967 --> 00:24:15.600
We should at least tell her
that we got revenge for her.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.000
Hey! Oh Dae O! Are you okay?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.100
Huh?

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.833
Oh Dae O?

00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:23.552
No wonder he seemed familiar.

00:24:23.552 --> 00:24:25.767
That's him, right?

00:24:25.767 --> 00:24:27.800
The squid from the blind date with us.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.900
What?

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.933
What?

00:24:29.933 --> 00:24:31.767
A blind date?

00:24:31.767 --> 00:24:35.467
Yeah, that squid who just
wouldn't stop talking back then.

00:24:35.467 --> 00:24:38.100
Wait, you only just realized that?

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.300
So what? What?

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.333
What do you mean 'what'?

00:24:42.333 --> 00:24:45.200
If you were me, would you
want to keep looking at your face?

00:24:49.967 --> 00:24:53.867
So you never properly looked at my face before?

00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:55.533
I saw it once.

00:24:55.533 --> 00:24:58.267
Darn it, I only saw it once.

00:24:58.267 --> 00:25:00.767
Ah, my eyes!

00:25:00.767 --> 00:25:03.467
Hey, what should I do? Are you okay?
You're not going blind, are you?

00:25:03.467 --> 00:25:06.592
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay? Let me see.

00:25:07.808 --> 00:25:09.184
Crazy, darn it!

00:25:09.184 --> 00:25:12.533
- Ah, seriously, what's wrong with you?
- Hey!

00:25:12.533 --> 00:25:13.567
Hey! Hey!

00:25:13.567 --> 00:25:15.633
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

00:25:15.633 --> 00:25:17.533
Stop, no!

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.000
Sit down.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.700
- Hey, Dae O.
- Hey, you guys.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.400
Sit.

00:25:25.933 --> 00:25:28.133
Tae Seon.

00:25:29.533 --> 00:25:32.100
What? What's going on?

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.167
They hit me.

00:25:37.567 --> 00:25:40.000
Baeblu's such a good friend.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.600
Baeblu must rush over
because they're good friends, right?

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.633
Yes.

00:25:45.633 --> 00:25:48.033
Hurry up. They might be waiting.

00:25:48.033 --> 00:25:49.400
Ye Rim, I'm sorry.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.967
Then I'll see you next week.

00:25:50.967 --> 00:25:52.700
Yeah.

00:25:54.333 --> 00:25:55.367
Then I should...

00:25:55.367 --> 00:25:57.333
Oh, you should stay and hang out longer.

00:25:57.333 --> 00:26:00.600
- Huh?
- There's plenty of food left.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.067
Aren't you curious about the modeling world?

00:26:02.067 --> 00:26:03.233
I'm curious.

00:26:03.233 --> 00:26:04.800
Then

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.100
what do you want to know?

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.600
More importantly,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.200
should we finish our earlier conversation?

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.867
What conversation?

00:26:11.867 --> 00:26:13.867
About school bullies.

00:26:14.967 --> 00:26:17.967
I have a lot to say about school bullies.

00:26:17.967 --> 00:26:19.933
I still remember it vividly.

00:26:19.933 --> 00:26:22.000
The faces of those who tormented me that day.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.967
Their snickering laughter.

00:26:23.967 --> 00:26:26.967
Even the disgustingly humid weather that day.

00:26:26.967 --> 00:26:30.367
Like they say, forgiving makes
your heart feel lighter.

00:26:30.367 --> 00:26:32.267
Or the one who got hit sleeps well,

00:26:32.267 --> 00:26:34.933
but the bully can't.

00:26:34.933 --> 00:26:37.033
All that's complete nonsense.

00:26:37.033 --> 00:26:38.367
People like that

00:26:38.367 --> 00:26:42.900
should gather all the universe's energy
to become utterly miserable.

00:26:44.064 --> 00:26:45.967
Exactly!

00:26:46.633 --> 00:26:50.467
Oh, not the right vibe?

00:26:50.467 --> 00:26:51.900
Black.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.367
Did that happen to you in school?

00:27:06.533 --> 00:27:08.333
What's with her?

00:27:13.376 --> 00:27:16.200
Wait, was she saying that for me to hear?

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.633
Ugh, annoying.

00:27:18.633 --> 00:27:23.433
Came to this lousy place
and got involved with lousy people.

00:27:23.433 --> 00:27:26.667
Darn, this is annoying.

00:27:26.667 --> 00:27:28.633
Why are you out there?

00:27:30.848 --> 00:27:32.567
Because I'm too full.

00:27:32.567 --> 00:27:34.600
Yeah, me too.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.400
Maybe doing this will help me digest it?

00:27:38.267 --> 00:27:39.767
By the way, mister.

00:27:39.767 --> 00:27:41.700
Yeah?

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.967
About Black.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.933
She's super charismatic.

00:27:46.933 --> 00:27:48.667
Yeah, right?

00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:53.367
Because of that, she seems to speak

00:27:53.367 --> 00:27:55.933
pretty directly to you guys.

00:27:55.933 --> 00:27:57.067
Yeah?

00:27:57.067 --> 00:28:00.833
I guess you don't notice
because you see her often.

00:28:04.367 --> 00:28:06.367
Did you say your name is Ye Rim?

00:28:07.767 --> 00:28:09.533
Excuse me, officer.

00:28:09.533 --> 00:28:10.800
Do you have friends?

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.833
I do.

00:28:11.833 --> 00:28:13.900
- Call your dad.
- Imagine a bunch of bullies

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.567
doodling all over your friend's face,

00:28:15.567 --> 00:28:17.933
taking pictures, and giggling about it.

00:28:17.933 --> 00:28:19.500
- Could you just stand by?
- What am I supposed to do?

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.267
Ah, but you shouldn't beat people up like this.

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:25.267
So even with the rain pouring
and them tossing your friend to the ground,

00:28:25.267 --> 00:28:27.133
you'd just do nothing?

00:28:27.133 --> 00:28:28.267
When did I say I'd just stand by?

00:28:28.267 --> 00:28:29.433
I said I wouldn't hit anyone.

00:28:29.433 --> 00:28:31.167
Ah, this is really annoying.

00:28:31.167 --> 00:28:33.533
Yeah, we're the ones who doodled on her face,

00:28:33.533 --> 00:28:34.967
but on a rainy day like that?

00:28:34.967 --> 00:28:36.700
Even we didn't want to do it.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.933
- Hey.
- Let go.

00:28:38.933 --> 00:28:40.833
I'm so annoyed I can't take this anymore.

00:28:40.833 --> 00:28:44.900
Hey, she told us to deal with
your loser friend, so we had no choice.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.784
Hey, stop it.

00:28:46.784 --> 00:28:48.167
Leave her be, and yeah.

00:28:48.167 --> 00:28:49.767
We were ordered to do it.

00:28:49.767 --> 00:28:52.864
I don't even care about your loser friend
anymore, but she made us!

00:28:52.864 --> 00:28:55.633
- How dare you call her a loser?
- Don't.

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:57.533
Made you?

00:28:57.533 --> 00:28:59.833
Someone ordered you to mess with U Yeon?

00:28:59.833 --> 00:29:01.867
Who? Why?

00:29:01.867 --> 00:29:05.767
If we tell you, you two need to work it out
and be done with it, okay?

00:29:05.767 --> 00:29:07.500
Who was it?

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.367
It's Ye Rim.

00:29:09.367 --> 00:29:10.867
Do you like Gi Jeong?

00:29:10.867 --> 00:29:11.867
Pardon?

00:29:11.867 --> 00:29:13.767
But Gi Jeong isn't interested in you, right?

00:29:13.767 --> 00:29:17.633
That's why you are annoyed with U Yeon, huh?

00:29:17.633 --> 00:29:19.067
Well, you know how Gi Jeong is.

00:29:19.067 --> 00:29:22.100
This isn't about trying to impress him,

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.933
but rather to create conflict between them?

00:29:25.933 --> 00:29:27.833
Did you think we wouldn't notice?

00:29:27.833 --> 00:29:32.200
Since you guys knew everything,
you guys played along nicely, right?

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.600
Played along? Us? When?

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.033
Pretending not to know is part of the act.

00:29:37.033 --> 00:29:39.233
We weren't pretending to go along with it.

00:29:39.233 --> 00:29:42.433
We did it because you're just a kid.

00:29:44.633 --> 00:29:46.200
Ye Rim.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.267
Don't try acting like an adult already.

00:29:48.267 --> 00:29:51.600
When you grow up, you'll have unavoidable reasons

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.000
to become pathetic sometimes.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.833
We all end up becoming
mediocre losers against our will.

00:30:06.592 --> 00:30:09.833
What does it matter? You're just bitter old farts.

00:30:15.072 --> 00:30:17.733
Hey, Ahn Ye Rim. Se Ryeong spilled everything.

00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:19.433
What is she talking about?

00:30:24.128 --> 00:30:25.633
Did you scold her?

00:30:26.752 --> 00:30:28.433
Oh please.

00:30:29.568 --> 00:30:33.267
I knew you would scare her from the start,

00:30:33.267 --> 00:30:34.467
but you held back a lot.

00:30:34.467 --> 00:30:36.967
Why would I pull rank on a kid?

00:30:36.967 --> 00:30:40.467
One solid and quick strike
at the right time would suffice.

00:30:40.467 --> 00:30:43.367
But that kid was brazen till the very end.

00:30:43.367 --> 00:30:45.967
I didn't expect her to just grab her bag
and leave without saying a word.

00:30:45.967 --> 00:30:47.633
And right in front of us.

00:30:47.633 --> 00:30:50.233
Kids these days are all like that, I guess.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.300
Back in my day...

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.272
No, hear my 'back in my day' story first.

00:30:54.272 --> 00:30:55.800
Hear my 'back in my day' story.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.633
Here, drink this.

00:30:57.633 --> 00:31:00.033
My story's way better.

00:31:01.088 --> 00:31:02.900
Looks like you need to come here.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.333
You should come, explain,
and apologize to settle this.

00:31:06.333 --> 00:31:08.767
Ah, those lunatics say it's only
a settlement if you do that.

00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:11.700
Even if both sides are wrong,
we're at a bigger disadvantage.

00:31:19.767 --> 00:31:22.567
Mi Rae! Yeom Se!

00:31:22.567 --> 00:31:24.300
Song.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.312
Gee.

00:31:25.312 --> 00:31:27.667
What happened to your face?

00:31:27.667 --> 00:31:29.500
If we hadn't run into each other,
nothing would've happened.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.400
But when they just showed up
in front of us, how could we ignore it?

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.833
Well, Miss Piggy.

00:31:34.833 --> 00:31:37.000
We're here too, you know.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.267
Wait, why...

00:31:39.267 --> 00:31:42.767
Do you know Ahn Ye Rim?

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:44.567
Ye Rim?

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.000
How do you know Ye Rim?

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.467
Last time when it rained, they messed with you.

00:31:53.467 --> 00:31:55.867
She was the one who ordered that.

00:31:58.633 --> 00:32:01.133
What are you talking about?

00:32:01.133 --> 00:32:04.167
Hey, you rats. Say that again.

00:32:04.167 --> 00:32:06.000
You said your boss Ahn Ye Rim ordered it, right?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Darn it.

00:32:08.833 --> 00:32:10.633
Boss?

00:32:23.433 --> 00:32:25.667
Hey, Ahn Ye Rim, you really not coming?

00:32:25.667 --> 00:32:28.064
The loser's friend's dad is a prosecutor!

00:32:28.064 --> 00:32:31.840
If my dad finds out about this again, I'm dead.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.200
Fine, it's do or die.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.800
I'll spill all your past stuff
on your precious InStar.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.833
Then you know your modeling career,
or anything else, is over, right?

00:32:41.833 --> 00:32:44.067
I don't care if I don't model.

00:32:44.867 --> 00:32:46.867
I'll just quit.

00:32:49.504 --> 00:32:52.767
You know what makes me better than you?

00:32:53.833 --> 00:32:57.000
I can actually take the CSAT and go to college.

00:32:57.933 --> 00:33:00.033
Where are you running to?

00:33:15.072 --> 00:33:16.533
Unbelievable.

00:33:16.533 --> 00:33:18.800
She told you that she's his ex?

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.000
You idiot, you actually believed that?

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:25.700
Wow, Ahn Ye Rim's terrifying.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.133
She tricked you into inviting her to SF.

00:33:29.133 --> 00:33:30.233
What?

00:33:30.233 --> 00:33:32.000
And that punk Nam Gi Jeong.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.767
They work together,
so he should've known what she's like.

00:33:34.767 --> 00:33:36.600
Jeez.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.700
Nam Gi Jeong didn't tell you anything?

00:33:40.384 --> 00:33:42.467
Hey, you might not realize it,

00:33:42.467 --> 00:33:46.500
but she's not the type to just run into someone
and help them by chance.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.900
She likes me.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.467
- That's why...
- I know.

00:33:50.467 --> 00:33:52.400
He told me.

00:33:55.392 --> 00:33:57.800
He told me, but...

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.067
Why would I run?

00:34:03.067 --> 00:34:04.800
I'm just heading home.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.767
See you later, Gi Jeong.

00:34:06.767 --> 00:34:09.167
The ones at the police station right now,

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.367
they're your friends, right?

00:34:11.367 --> 00:34:13.067
Huh?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.733
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:34:24.633 --> 00:34:28.567
- Right.
- And you made them bully U Yeon too?

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.967
Yeah.

00:34:30.967 --> 00:34:34.033
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have touched her.

00:34:34.033 --> 00:34:36.633
You should've kept ignoring everyone as usual.

00:34:36.633 --> 00:34:39.300
Then maybe I could've given up too.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.067
Why did it have to be that pathetic girl...

00:34:43.776 --> 00:34:46.867
Do you know why I hate girls like you?

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:51.000
Because you try to use people's feelings.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.400
You can't earn someone's heart that way.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.700
I feel bad for her too.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.467
I'll apologize if that's what you want, so...

00:34:58.467 --> 00:34:59.776
No,

00:34:59.776 --> 00:35:01.900
don't apologize.

00:35:02.592 --> 00:35:03.900
U Yeon

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.933
will accept your apology and even forgive you.

00:35:06.933 --> 00:35:08.400
So absolutely not.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.033
And you don't need to apologize to me, either.

00:35:11.033 --> 00:35:12.733
What?

00:35:21.088 --> 00:35:25.933
Thanks to you, I'll spend my whole life
repaying my debt to U Yeon.

00:35:25.933 --> 00:35:28.933
For giving me a reason to stay by her side,

00:35:28.933 --> 00:35:30.433
thank you,

00:35:30.433 --> 00:35:31.933
Ahn Ye Rim.

00:35:34.304 --> 00:35:36.733
Sir, please let us go now.

00:35:36.733 --> 00:35:39.100
We really didn't do anything wrong.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.700
It's true.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.533
Alright, stop making a scene.

00:35:43.533 --> 00:35:46.600
- Is Prosecutor Yeom coming?
- Call your guardians now.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.100
Se Ra.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.900
Are you okay?

00:36:07.392 --> 00:36:09.900
You should've called your mother. Why me?

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.100
I didn't even think about that.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.567
Oh, it's hard.

00:36:14.567 --> 00:36:16.167
Hey.

00:36:16.167 --> 00:36:18.100
This is weird.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.367
Huh?

00:36:19.367 --> 00:36:21.000
What is?

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.200
I contacted Gi Jeong.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.433
He could've come by and caused a scene already.

00:36:26.433 --> 00:36:28.467
Song, haven't you heard from him?

00:36:28.467 --> 00:36:30.400
He didn't come?

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.167
You can't reach him, can you?

00:36:32.167 --> 00:36:34.767
Se Ra, your mom's coming.

00:36:40.933 --> 00:36:44.067
Okay, it's late. Everyone go home.

00:36:44.067 --> 00:36:46.600
- Thank you.
- Alright.

00:36:49.433 --> 00:36:51.133
Bye.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.900
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:36:59.167 --> 00:37:00.167
Mi Rae, go ahead first.

00:37:00.167 --> 00:37:01.333
I have somewhere to be.

00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:03.200
- Where?
- See you tomorrow.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.400
Huh? At this hour?

00:37:07.367 --> 00:37:10.967
- Tae Seon, can you...
- Want me to walk you home?

00:37:10.967 --> 00:37:13.667
Worry about yourself.

00:37:18.633 --> 00:37:21.667
Do you know why I hate girls like you?

00:37:21.667 --> 00:37:24.400
Because you try to use people's feelings.

00:38:01.024 --> 00:38:03.733
What? Want to hit me?

00:38:03.733 --> 00:38:07.033
Was everything they said true?

00:38:07.033 --> 00:38:08.200
You heard it already, right?

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.233
I want to hear it from you.

00:38:09.233 --> 00:38:12.467
Why ask when you already know?

00:38:12.467 --> 00:38:15.733
Darn, still pretending
to be the good one till the end.

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.033
I'm not that nice.

00:38:24.033 --> 00:38:25.433
What?

00:38:25.433 --> 00:38:28.533
When you asked if I liked Gi Jeong earlier,

00:38:28.533 --> 00:38:32.400
I actually hoped you'd just be the bad person.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.267
If you hadn't asked me,

00:38:36.267 --> 00:38:39.833
I might never have realized my own feelings.

00:38:39.833 --> 00:38:41.312
Thanks,

00:38:41.312 --> 00:38:42.933
Ye Rim.

00:38:43.552 --> 00:38:46.233
For giving me a reason to stay by her side,

00:38:46.233 --> 00:38:47.763
thank you,

00:38:47.763 --> 00:38:49.300
Ahn Ye Rim.

00:38:50.912 --> 00:38:55.200
I hope you find someone even better than Gi Jeong.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.900
Bye.

00:39:07.233 --> 00:39:11.776
Nam Gi Jeong must be so disappointed in me.

00:39:11.776 --> 00:39:14.800
I would be too.

00:39:18.433 --> 00:39:20.667
Not here, either.

00:39:23.067 --> 00:39:25.167
Come to think of it,

00:39:25.167 --> 00:39:28.267
Gi Jeong always showed up when I struggled.

00:39:28.267 --> 00:39:29.600
- My chicken!
- My chicken!

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.867
Don't cower if you did nothing wrong.

00:39:32.832 --> 00:39:36.267
When I was bullied,

00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:39.000
when I struggled with Mom...

00:39:40.033 --> 00:39:43.767
If this punishment
comes from taking him for granted,

00:39:43.767 --> 00:39:46.300
you deserve it, Song U Yeon.

00:39:56.033 --> 00:39:57.767
Gi Jeong.

00:40:04.896 --> 00:40:06.733
I'm sorry.

00:40:08.992 --> 00:40:10.700
I was such a fool.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.167
Why are you the fool?

00:40:13.167 --> 00:40:15.667
I'm the fool.

00:40:15.667 --> 00:40:18.533
Everything that happened to you is my fault.

00:40:18.533 --> 00:40:19.567
Exactly.

00:40:19.567 --> 00:40:21.667
I don't mess up spelling for nothing.

00:40:21.667 --> 00:40:23.233
It's all because I'm stupid.

00:40:23.233 --> 00:40:24.867
What's the point of looking good on the outside?

00:40:24.867 --> 00:40:27.200
I didn't even notice you were hurt.

00:40:28.667 --> 00:40:30.900
It's okay.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.333
Now that you're here, it doesn't matter.

00:40:34.333 --> 00:40:36.033
Really.

00:40:39.488 --> 00:40:41.400
I'm sorry.

00:40:42.067 --> 00:40:44.033
Sorry, U Yeon.

00:40:50.368 --> 00:40:52.333
Now that I think about it,

00:40:52.333 --> 00:40:54.467
I was acting really weird today.

00:40:54.467 --> 00:40:55.900
You know what adults say?

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.100
It's like I was possessed.

00:40:59.367 --> 00:41:01.867
I have something to tell you.

00:41:01.867 --> 00:41:03.933
I...

00:41:03.933 --> 00:41:05.667
I...

00:41:07.067 --> 00:41:09.567
I think I like you.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.100
What?

00:41:14.833 --> 00:41:17.667
I think I like you too.

00:41:21.033 --> 00:41:23.600
Forget it. If you didn't hear me, just leave.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.867
I like you more.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.767
I like you more, U Yeon.

00:41:44.233 --> 00:41:46.500
Yeom Se Ra, are you out of your mind?

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.467
You had to cause trouble at a time like this?

00:41:48.467 --> 00:41:49.800
Stop it.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.133
I never asked you to take care of my child.

00:41:52.133 --> 00:41:53.400
Stay out of it.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.733
You don't even care about her. Why interfere?

00:41:55.733 --> 00:41:59.333
You think dropping by every six months
and acting nice makes up for everything?

00:42:00.767 --> 00:42:02.133
Se Ra.

00:42:02.133 --> 00:42:04.367
You'll be a senior next year.

00:42:04.367 --> 00:42:07.967
I thought you were doing fine alone.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:13.067
Mom, so you do know I'll be a senior next year.

00:42:13.067 --> 00:42:15.800
You've shown so little interest.
I figured you wouldn't even know.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.333
Se Ra, what's gotten into you?

00:42:17.333 --> 00:42:19.767
What kids take care of themselves like me?

00:42:19.767 --> 00:42:22.233
Even though you and Dad
both refused to take me in,

00:42:22.233 --> 00:42:23.867
I grew up on my own

00:42:23.867 --> 00:42:25.667
and never once lost first place in my class.

00:42:25.667 --> 00:42:28.333
What more do you want from me?

00:42:31.267 --> 00:42:33.067
Se Ra.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.900
Se Ra.

00:42:50.833 --> 00:42:52.767
I'm sorry.

00:43:14.784 --> 00:43:17.467
Where have you been all this time, huh?

00:43:17.467 --> 00:43:20.633
You didn't answer your phone,
and you weren't at the study room!

00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:24.300
Are you seriously going to keep acting like this?

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.667
How long are you going to
keep rebelling like this?

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.733
So you've decided not to talk at all now?

00:43:31.733 --> 00:43:35.200
How long are you going to keep ignoring me?

00:43:44.267 --> 00:43:46.533
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:43:46.533 --> 00:43:50.467
Something happened
with Se Ra and Mi Rae, so I stayed late.

00:43:50.467 --> 00:43:52.267
I'm not being rebellious.

00:43:52.267 --> 00:43:55.067
Sorry for not answering calls.

00:43:55.067 --> 00:43:56.576
Sorry for...

00:43:56.576 --> 00:43:59.200
being rude last time too.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.933
I won't do that again.

00:44:11.167 --> 00:44:12.533
I'll go shower.

00:44:12.533 --> 00:44:14.500
You should cool off too, Mom.

00:44:36.224 --> 00:44:39.600
What a day it's been.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.433
Even after living 18 years,

00:44:42.433 --> 00:44:45.400
the world is still full of things
I don't understand.

00:44:46.033 --> 00:44:48.167
Right, Delulu?

00:44:54.267 --> 00:44:56.067
I know.

00:44:56.067 --> 00:44:59.967
That at some point, Delulu disappeared.

00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:02.933
And today I realized

00:45:02.933 --> 00:45:05.833
that with or without Delulu,

00:45:05.833 --> 00:45:10.867
I've always made decisions
that stayed true to myself.

00:45:10.867 --> 00:45:15.533
Even if those choices were
the wrong ones, as they often were.

00:45:15.533 --> 00:45:20.367
Even if that meant facing pain
and getting hurt all over again.

00:45:20.367 --> 00:45:23.367
Yeah, you heard and you know it.

00:45:23.367 --> 00:45:24.700
But you don't care?

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.200
Why should I care?

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.400
Lies.

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.233
What's that got to do with me?

00:45:29.233 --> 00:45:31.200
Upon lies...

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.667
I spent the day telling lies upon lies.

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.367
U Yeon, do you like Gi Jeong?

00:45:40.367 --> 00:45:41.376
Huh?

00:45:41.376 --> 00:45:44.300
If you hadn't asked me,

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.367
I might never have realized my own feelings.

00:45:47.367 --> 00:45:48.967
In the end,

00:45:48.967 --> 00:45:52.200
I'm someone who always finds a way,

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.900
no, someone who knows
how to find the best conclusion for myself.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.733
I think I like you.

00:45:58.733 --> 00:45:59.733
What?

00:45:59.733 --> 00:46:02.300
Even if I don't know much,
even if I'm a little slow...

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.733
[Would you like to accept the membership?]
Eventually,

00:46:03.733 --> 00:46:08.400
believing that I'm someone
who can actually get there,

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.700
that's my way of loving myself.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.233
Even without Delulu,

00:46:16.233 --> 00:46:18.176
now

00:46:18.176 --> 00:46:19.867
I know.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.733
I don't know anymore.

00:46:35.133 --> 00:46:37.533
Me, dating Koo Seon Ho?

00:46:44.533 --> 00:46:46.400
No way. No.

00:46:49.067 --> 00:46:52.433
Then what if Koo Seon Ho
falls in love with some other girl?

00:46:56.133 --> 00:46:58.336
Honestly,

00:46:58.336 --> 00:47:01.033
that doesn't feel great, either.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.867
You like Koo Seon Ho, don't you?

00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:08.933
I do.

00:47:08.933 --> 00:47:11.533
Do you feel good when you're with him?

00:47:11.533 --> 00:47:12.800
- Of course, I do.
- Comfortable?

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.333
Very comfortable.

00:47:14.333 --> 00:47:16.933
Then you've got a bit of possessiveness
toward him, don't you?

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.500
Well...

00:47:21.467 --> 00:47:24.967
I mean, maybe a little bit.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.700
You kinda want exclusive rights
to him too, don't you?

00:47:32.333 --> 00:47:33.833
Yeah, I do.

00:47:33.833 --> 00:47:36.500
So if Koo Seon Ho gets married,
would you be 100% happy for him?

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:43.933
Certainly not 100%, no.

00:47:46.333 --> 00:47:47.900
Okay, last question.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.467
Do you get butterflies when you're with him?

00:47:52.767 --> 00:47:55.767
You mean, do I get butterflies thinking about him?

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.733
[Koo Seon Ho]
What's this? It's nearly at dawn.

00:48:02.333 --> 00:48:05.233
Today I'll break this elephant curse.

00:48:07.233 --> 00:48:09.133
Ugh, seriously.

00:48:12.128 --> 00:48:13.736
Jeez.

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.600
Why does he look different again?

00:48:27.167 --> 00:48:28.667
You're here.

00:48:28.667 --> 00:48:30.000
I am.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.133
No chit-chat. Solve it quick.

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.633
Solve it.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.967
Ah, I said solve it!

00:48:37.967 --> 00:48:40.267
- I can't solve it.
- Hey!

00:48:40.267 --> 00:48:44.200
Even if I want to solve it, I don't know how.

00:48:45.667 --> 00:48:48.832
Oh, so you poisoned me

00:48:48.832 --> 00:48:50.967
and now you're saying there's no antidote?

00:48:52.067 --> 00:48:53.900
Your choice of words...

00:48:54.667 --> 00:48:57.300
Can't you be more romantic?

00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.200
What romance is there between us?

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.400
What?

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.600
Why those puppy eyes?

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.300
You think I'll fall for that act?

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.667
I'm not buying it.

00:49:07.667 --> 00:49:09.467
Look at your track record.

00:49:09.467 --> 00:49:10.900
Never once wavered.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.600
And your confession to me came so easily, too.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:16.333
Even if I ran wild with flowers in my hair,
you'd watch from above like some deity,

00:49:16.333 --> 00:49:18.200
even throwing curses my way.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.833
So confident, huh?

00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:22.633
Darn show-off.

00:49:22.633 --> 00:49:24.767
Did it look easy for me?

00:49:25.467 --> 00:49:27.167
Huh?

00:49:31.333 --> 00:49:34.133
It wasn't easy at all.

00:49:34.133 --> 00:49:38.667
Every single day, I was shaken and anxious.

00:49:38.667 --> 00:49:41.033
If you were me, could you really stay calm?

00:49:41.033 --> 00:49:44.000
I'm not some extraordinary guy, you know.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.800
No, I mean...

00:49:50.464 --> 00:49:53.967
I honestly don't even know anymore.

00:49:53.967 --> 00:49:55.700
It's not that I dislike you.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.933
No, I do like you.

00:49:57.933 --> 00:50:00.067
But I just can't picture it.

00:50:00.067 --> 00:50:02.367
How could we become lovers?

00:50:02.367 --> 00:50:05.100
If we dated, we'd have to...

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.667
We'd need to kiss.

00:50:07.667 --> 00:50:10.333
I just can't imagine kissing you.

00:50:10.333 --> 00:50:12.267
No matter how hard I try,

00:50:12.267 --> 00:50:13.967
I can't picture it.

00:50:13.967 --> 00:50:16.933
It doesn't even feel real.

00:50:29.867 --> 00:50:31.567
A star

00:50:32.467 --> 00:50:37.333
grows, little by little, over billions of years.

00:50:37.333 --> 00:50:41.233
But when gravity can't withstand
its own energy anymore,

00:50:41.233 --> 00:50:43.800
then boom, it explodes.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.700
The star

00:50:52.033 --> 00:50:54.033
has exploded.

00:50:59.267 --> 00:51:01.067
Seon Ho.

00:51:24.704 --> 00:51:27.067
We're dating, we're really dating!

00:51:27.067 --> 00:51:29.333
Thinking about Gi Jeong
just fills you with energy, huh?

00:51:29.333 --> 00:51:31.467
- Yeah.
- Lacks thrill now.

00:51:31.467 --> 00:51:33.267
The adrenaline of almost getting caught...

00:51:33.267 --> 00:51:34.400
- A date?
- A date?

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.400
You got a boyfriend?

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.900
- I don't like him.
- Hey, squirt.

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.496
- Want ice cream?
- Yes.

00:51:38.496 --> 00:51:40.567
- Come on!
- Coolest guy ever.

00:51:40.567 --> 00:51:42.733
I'll play the fool a thousand times for you.

00:51:42.733 --> 00:51:44.400
Since you started dating that punk...

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.667
I've totally forgotten him.

00:51:45.667 --> 00:51:47.567
You're so obvious.

00:51:47.567 --> 00:51:49.233
Did your parents teach you to lie?

00:51:49.233 --> 00:51:50.833
Can't let this slide.

00:51:50.833 --> 00:51:53.100
If he starts acting up, give him a good smack.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:56.067
If you don't have a girlfriend,
how about my sister?

00:52:15.133 --> 00:52:17.767
He doesn't like me because I'm overweight.
