=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.900
=Episode 13=

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:22.080
Morning.

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.839
Morning?

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:24.919
Look at the time.
How is it still morning?

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:26.160
You finished eating?

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:30.399
If we had waited for you
from breakfast to lunchtime,

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.720
we would've starved to death.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.279
What?

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:35.559
I gave up such a good opportunity
in Shanghai. Can't I sleep in a little?

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.119
Meiqi.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.399
Since you're not going to
work in Shanghai,

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.160
find a job here in Nanzhou.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.919
You can't stay at home sleeping all day.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.160
What are you talking about?

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.340
Do we need the chump change from her?

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.039
Tell me about it.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.240
Whether she earns a lot or not
doesn't matter.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.330
The point is that she needs
to be out in society

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.039
and go through some challenges.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.240
It'll be good for her.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.520
Remember, Meiqi.

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:00.000
Home is your backing,

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:01.960
but it's not a shield.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.640
Get the door, Miss.

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:09.640
Miss.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.559
You're back.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:11.679
Dad, Mom.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.310
- You're here, Mingzhu.
- You're here, Mingzhu.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.200
Have you eaten?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.240
I have.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.279
Meiqi, look.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.159
Pretty.

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:21.760
I have a great taste, don't I?

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.800
This dress is really nice.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.439
Thank you

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.520
for getting it.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.399
Don't mention it.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.640
Mingzhu.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.480
Come here.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.540
Talk about perfect timing.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.559
I'm looking at baby strollers.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:32.839
I picked this.

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:33.999
What do you think?

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:35.439
Do you like this model?

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:39.159
This one is over twenty thousand.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.839
I know this brand.

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:45.200
The British royal family uses it.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.960
It's good.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.480
See?

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:48.640
Meiqi has taste.

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:49.800
Let me tell you.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.159
This stroller

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.719
is classic. Purely handmade.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.800
Mom, we don't need to
spend that kind of money.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.320
Kids grow fast.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.760
They'll only use it for two years.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.640
It's not necessary.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.320
They grow fast,
that's why you need a good stroller.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.679
You should give the best

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:04.760
to the baby at every stage.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.279
Yes.

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:06.520
Meiqi is right.

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:08.159
Money is meant to be spent.

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.320
You need to change
how you think about spending,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.119
all right?

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:12.920
Everything is for the child.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.800
For the child's sake.

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.040
Mom, I know you want the best
for the baby.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.240
But raising a child
will cost a lot later.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.200
We should save the money

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:24.999
and buy an education fund for the baby.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.399
I agree.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.520
I strongly agree.

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:30.080
I agree we should save

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.559
and buy an education fund.

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.599
I looked at that stroller too.

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:37.119
One of my coworkers has it.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.559
He said it was expensive.

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:39.640
More than twenty thousand.

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.960
His kid has grown
and doesn't use it anymore.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.240
We can borrow it.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.520
I think that solves the problem.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.559
Yeah. That works.

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.040
Which friend?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040
Do I know him?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.279
No, you don't.

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:51.560
He's from the subsidiary company.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.800
Subsidiary company?

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.240
Young people these days
are really something.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.040
A subsidiary company worker

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.930
can buy a stroller
worth twenty thousand yuan.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.360
A stroller worth twenty thousand yuan?

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.439
Does it fly?

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:03.200
I'm not buying it this time.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.559
Relax. We didn't buy.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.559
Jianqi's dad said his friend

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:08.159
has a spare one we can use.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.559
I want to use the money I save

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.080
to buy insurance for the baby.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.240
That's a good idea.
Buy it from Xiaoni's mom.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.279
Come on. I'll go with you.

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:17.520
No. If your mom finds out,
she'll chew you out.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.799
Don't worry.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.839
She's been feeling bad for her lately.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.680
Why?

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:25.320
They were missing a pregnancy test kit.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.200
Your dad is seeing someone else?

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.200
Let me tell you.

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:34.520
We found the pregnancy test.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.000
It was under the counter.

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.039
I misunderstood your dad.

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.960
You're here.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.200
Dad, where were you?

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:42.799
I went to South Gate

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:44.000
to deliver an urn.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.839
Ordering it from me

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.200
(Ni's Clinic)
is much cheaper than at the funeral home.

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:50.239
Mingzhu, you came to see me?

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:51.039
No, Mr. Ni.

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.000
I'm here to ask Mrs. Ni about insurance.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.440
I want to buy insurance for the baby.

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:55.760
That's good.

00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:57.279
You have to have the awareness.

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.399
Alright. You guys talk.

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:00.880
Mingzhu,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.279
the baby hasn't been born yet,

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:03.599
so don't rush.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.320
The most important thing is

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.359
to insure the breadwinner.

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:09.159
Right.

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.200
Think about Jianqi.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.159
We never know what we'll encounter.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.239
Then I'll buy it for my father-in-law.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.520
He's the only one who can earn money
in the Feng family.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.000
Sure. Then who's the beneficiary?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.680
Mingzhu buys it.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.279
Of course, it's her.

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.239
No. Put the designated beneficiary.

00:05:27.799 --> 00:05:29.680
Mingzhu, you're such a nice girl.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.540
Mrs. Ni, when the policy is ready,
let me know. I'll come collect it.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.880
Okay.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.599
I'll go first.

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:34.080
Sure.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.880
I'll head off too.

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:36.719
Bye, Xiaoni's mom.

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:37.479
Take care.

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:38.120
Okay.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:45.640
Are you busy?

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:54.039
Debao.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.320
Mrs. Shen.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.200
Wang.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.000
Xiu'e.

00:05:57.359 --> 00:05:58.399
No patients?

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.440
What's that?

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.479
I'm so sorry about one thing.

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.239
The missing pregnancy test
from your clinic

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.760
was taken by my husband.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.799
He left in a hurry
and forgot to mention it.

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:14.919
This one is new.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.039
I bought it to make up for it.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.359
Ni Dehao!

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.640
Didn't you say the missing test kit
was found under the counter?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.399
What's with this one?

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.640
Why lie?

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.719
If you have nothing to hide, why lie?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.440
Are you seeing someone outside?

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.799
Explain yourself.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.440
I can't make this clear now.

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:36.799
But I swear,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.320
ever since we had Xiaoni,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.399
I haven't messed around
with anyone outside.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.200
Liar!

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.440
I can swear on my late parents.

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:45.960
I won't believe you again.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.399
I can swear on my late parents!

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.719
I must've been blind

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.520
- Don't pull my hair.
- to marry you!

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:53.359
I'm done with this life.

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:55.440
I'm done with you.

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.440
We're over!

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.399
Calm her down.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.680
You're really my friend, huh?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.239
- Don't button it. It looks bulky.
- Don't button it?

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:15.599
Yes. Keep it natural.

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:17.680
Okay. And this ring?

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.120
Well.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.960
My mother-in-law gave it to me.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.399
Put it on.

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:21.919
- I'll put it on.
- Put that on.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.640
I don't want to. I might lose it.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.159
Put it on.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.159
- Put it on.
- Really?

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:30.160
- It looks nice.
- Mom.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.320
It's fine whether you put it on or not.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.560
It's the same.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.560
We should go.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.320
What?

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.159
I'm going today to make you look good,
you know?

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:41.640
Dacheng, speak politely.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.080
Especially when we meet Mingzhu

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.320
and Bichen's parents.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.640
Just speak politely.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.760
Got it.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.640
Zhixia's here.

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:51.880
Stop scaring us.

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.200
You look good.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.399
Are you ready?

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.640
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.560
Are you?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.919
Mom,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.719
I bought you so many nice clothes.

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:02.000
Why do you always wear your ugly ones?

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.320
Is it ugly?

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.479
But your dad says

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:07.279
this color looks nice.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.799
It doesn't look nice?

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:10.520
We're running late.

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:12.320
We're running late.

00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:13.560
Just go with this.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.839
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:15.919
I need to get the money.

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:18.200
- Hurry up.
- I know. The money is inside.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:18.960
Hurry up.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.560
Mingzhu,

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:34.680
we're parking. We'll be right there.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.359
If you don't want to meet us,
you can avoid us.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:40.800
Well,

00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:42.400
is Mingzhu

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.359
working today?

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.479
What if we run into her, Zhixia?

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:48.999
Maybe she's not here.

00:08:49.479 --> 00:08:50.280
What if she is?

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:50.999
Right.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.800
Say hi.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.320
Yes, say hi to her.

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:02.879
Welcome.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.599
Mingzhu, you're working today.

00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:07.519
We...

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.719
Thank you so much.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.160
Not at all. It's my job.

00:09:12.879 --> 00:09:13.719
This way, please.

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:16.680
Mom.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:18.999
Go.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.200
- Go.
- Let's go.

00:09:25.335 --> 00:09:27.239
Zhixia, thank you

00:09:27.239 --> 00:09:28.560
for helping me hit my KPI.

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:29.879
No need for that.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.280
I'm not the one paying.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.639
It's me. I'm paying.

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:40.999
I also prepared two bottles of wine.

00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:43.719
I asked the chef to handle the rest.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.160
Sure.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.800
Thank you, Mingzhu.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.680
You're welcome.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.040
Stay and eat with us.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.599
Yes.

00:09:50.599 --> 00:09:51.560
No, I can't.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.359
It's fine.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.479
Mom, Mingzhu's working now.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.920
- Right.
- Don't let us keep you.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.920
Alright. Call me if you need anything.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.040
Go ahead.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.080
Go ahead.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.879
Careful with the stairs.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.759
Look at her. Just like me.

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:10.440
Yes.

00:10:14.359 --> 00:10:16.920
The dishes are great.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:21.879
The dishes.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.280
Mingzhu.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.560
Zhixia.

00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:30.200
Yes.

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:35.080
Zhixia, how much does this cost?

00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:36.879
I'm not paying anyway.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.999
I'm paying.

00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:41.040
I brought the bank card.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.320
Where's my card?

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.450
Bichen's family just arrived.

00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:46.479
Why aren't you going down
to greet them?

00:10:46.719 --> 00:10:48.759
You're a grown man. Have some manners.

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:49.519
- Right.
- Dad.

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:51.080
Let's go greet them together.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.280
- We should go too.
- We should be polite.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.239
Yes. Hurry up.

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:54.680
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.519
- Bichen.
- Zhixia.

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:55.960
Mrs. Yuan.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.920
These are my parents.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.639
Hello, Mr. Yuan, Mrs. Yuan.

00:10:57.639 --> 00:10:58.560
Mrs. Yuan.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.560
Come, Mr. Yuan.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.639
- Come.
- Sure.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.080
You look so young, Mrs. Yuan.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.920
Thank you.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.119
Here.

00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:07.719
Sure.

00:11:07.719 --> 00:11:08.320
Please have a seat.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.920
Please sit.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.879
Have a seat.

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:15.359
Mrs. Yuan,

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:17.280
the shrimp are really fresh.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:17.920
Please have it.

00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:19.639
- Try it.
- I tried it.

00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:22.839
Dacheng, don't just eat yourself.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:23.960
Help Mr. Yuan a bit.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.680
Mr. Yuan, help yourself.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.999
Have some more.

00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:29.239
We're not sure

00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:31.519
if the dishes suit your taste.

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:32.839
It's good.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.839
The food here is great.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.239
You've treated us generously.

00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:39.960
Here.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.440
Bichen, eat this.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.280
I'll pour you a drink.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:41.999
No, please don't.

00:11:41.999 --> 00:11:43.519
I can't drink much.

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:45.759
Bichen, pour Mr. Xu some.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.080
Mr. Xu, let me pour for you.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.879
Sure.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.519
Bicen is really lovely.

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:53.080
Yes.

00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:56.479
I'm not saying this
because she's my daughter.

00:11:56.479 --> 00:11:56.999
Thank you.

00:11:56.999 --> 00:11:59.639
Bichen's been very well-behaved
since she was little.

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:00.200
Yes.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.080
Zhidong too.

00:12:02.359 --> 00:12:03.639
He's so sensible.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.239
He's very sensible.

00:12:08.119 --> 00:12:08.920
Well.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.400
Regarding the bride price,

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:16.879
Zhidong told us.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.320
Two hundred thousand isn't much.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.239
Actually,

00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:28.960
we don't consider it a bride price.

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:30.280
In the end,

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.359
it'll go back to them

00:12:32.359 --> 00:12:34.519
as their starting funds
for married life.

00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:36.999
That's great.

00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:38.479
Zhixia.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.680
That's really good.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.599
Zhidong, your mother-in-law...

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.759
Your future mother-in-law

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.920
is so thoughtful.

00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:49.879
Really.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.320
We only have this one daughter.

00:12:53.479 --> 00:12:54.400
To be honest,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.560
we've spoiled her since she was little.

00:12:57.519 --> 00:12:59.280
She was a naughty girl.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.879
She poured laundry detergent
into the rice cooker.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.599
Her dad almost had
to get his stomach pumped.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.960
She was mischievous,

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.239
but we couldn't bear to beat her.

00:13:09.239 --> 00:13:10.119
So now,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.639
she's grown up,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.080
but she can't wash dishes properly,

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.719
can't wash clothes properly,

00:13:14.719 --> 00:13:16.280
and her room is a mess.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.560
Mom, stop.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.239
Same.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.359
Let me tell you this.

00:13:20.359 --> 00:13:22.320
Zhidong is the same.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.119
He's very stubborn.
He takes that after his dad.

00:13:25.119 --> 00:13:26.359
Like a mule.

00:13:26.359 --> 00:13:28.800
The two mothers are doing
after-sales disclaimers.

00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:33.920
Come.

00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:37.119
Zhidong may not

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.920
be very successful,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.440
but he's honest.

00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:44.320
He's really honest.

00:13:44.719 --> 00:13:45.359
Zhidong,

00:13:46.119 --> 00:13:48.560
you're in the logistics department
at the academy.

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:50.040
Is there room to be promoted?

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.280
There is,

00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:55.239
but not much.

00:13:57.999 --> 00:14:00.719
See? He's honest, right?

00:14:00.719 --> 00:14:01.800
Very honest.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.719
Honesty is good.

00:14:04.759 --> 00:14:06.280
Yes.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.440
Back home, when a daughter gets married,

00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:13.960
the groom's side needs
to provide a house.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.560
Well,

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:16.999
Bichen and Zhidong

00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:18.639
have been together for years,

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:19.879
but your family

00:14:19.999 --> 00:14:22.119
doesn't seem to have plans
to buy a house.

00:14:28.719 --> 00:14:29.519
Yes.

00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:31.839
Housing here is expensive.

00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:34.800
Buying a house isn't easy.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.280
Yes.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.400
But

00:14:37.599 --> 00:14:40.519
it's hard to get married
without a place to live.

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:42.999
Relatives and friends will talk.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.839
We're not asking for
a big or fancy house,

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:47.680
right?

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.400
A second-hand house is fine.

00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:51.200
Forty or fifty square meters.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.879
Just a small place for the young couple.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.200
I don't think this is a big ask.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.999
No.

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.280
Not at all.

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:01.400
Hello?

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.119
Mr. Yuan, Mrs. Yuan, I have a call.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.440
It's not a big ask.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.440
Em... Yes.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.599
Not too much. Well...

00:15:08.119 --> 00:15:09.960
We'll think of a solution.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.320
- Yes.
- We'll think of something.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.280
We will.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.239
There's always a way.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.160
Don't worry.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.599
We're decent people.

00:15:18.599 --> 00:15:20.280
We want the kids to live well.

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:23.920
Whoever pays for the house,
the house belongs to that person.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.560
We won't ask

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.040
to put Bichen's name on it.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.999
As long as the young couple
lives happily,

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.519
that's more important than anything.

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:32.800
Yes, right.

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:35.040
Your family

00:15:35.719 --> 00:15:36.519
is very

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.080
reasonable.

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:42.759
We should work together more often.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.400
Don't worry.
I'll give you the lowest price.

00:15:48.719 --> 00:15:49.519
Excuse me.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.920
Are you Feng Jianqi's wife?

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.440
Quick. Bow to your savior.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.080
Is he the boy Jianqi saved?

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.280
My son

00:16:10.479 --> 00:16:11.639
was saved by Jianqi.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.839
From now on, my son

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:15.560
is your son.

00:16:15.719 --> 00:16:17.200
What's the point of saying that?

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.639
Your son is alive,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.359
but my nephew is gone.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:26.839
Get out.

00:16:27.879 --> 00:16:28.400
Get out!

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.479
I...

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.280
I invited some friends for lunch today.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.440
You see, that day at your house...

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.239
I'm sorry.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.440
My family was too emotional.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.759
It's alright. I understand.

00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:51.080
This is my card.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.160
My name is Guan Weidong.

00:16:55.479 --> 00:16:57.960
If you need anything, come to me.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.500
I'll get going. Don't let me keep you.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:08.920
Mingzhu,

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.039
who was that?

00:17:11.559 --> 00:17:12.719
Why are you out here?

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.270
My brother lives off my parents,

00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:16.719
and my parents rely on me.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.279
Why is getting married

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:29.999
this difficult these days?

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:34.239
A forty-square-meter

00:17:35.519 --> 00:17:38.360
apartment.

00:17:41.239 --> 00:17:43.279
Even that's tough for us.

00:17:44.479 --> 00:17:47.079
Mom, her parents said

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.759
we can discuss it again.

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:50.400
Discuss it again.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.640
Well, you...

00:17:53.479 --> 00:17:55.279
Whether it's second-hand

00:17:55.279 --> 00:17:56.640
or third-hand,

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.640
we simply can't afford it.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.719
Just raising the bride price alone
is hard enough.

00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:05.479
Yes, I know I can't afford it.

00:18:05.719 --> 00:18:07.360
But didn't you say
we'd try to find a way

00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:09.479
at lunch just now?

00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:11.479
What could I do?

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.440
Your dad promised them
like it was nothing.

00:18:15.319 --> 00:18:17.279
How was I supposed to respond?

00:18:17.279 --> 00:18:19.559
I could only say we'd think about it.

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:21.719
Right? We couldn't
ruin the talk right there.

00:18:21.719 --> 00:18:22.960
Do you want it to fall apart?

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.920
It's all Dad's fault.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.440
He shouldn't have made empty promises.

00:18:25.759 --> 00:18:27.519
Don't talk about your dad like that.

00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:29.120
Dacheng,

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:31.360
I have an idea.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.999
Why don't we

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:35.719
renovate this house

00:18:36.519 --> 00:18:37.600
and let them live here?

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.120
The two of us can move out and
build ourselves a small place outside.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.230
What are you talking about?

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.120
Zhidong can get married.

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:50.079
You can renovate the house.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.799
But why do you have to move out?

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.840
What if we don't have this place
to begin with?

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.980
Where are you supposed to go?

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.719
The son gets married,
and the parents sleep under a bridge?

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:58.600
It's not that.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.200
Mom, I don't agree either.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.079
Right.

00:19:01.079 --> 00:19:03.640
We could rent a place.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.120
Good idea.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.440
Rent? Whose house is this?

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:07.920
Well, Zhixia,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.640
calm down.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.719
Let's talk calmly.

00:19:10.719 --> 00:19:13.239
We're just discussing it.

00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:15.039
Let's speak nicely.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:15.960
Look,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.999
I really think Bichen is a good girl.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.479
Right? If she marries your brother,

00:19:20.479 --> 00:19:22.039
that's a blessing for our family.

00:19:22.039 --> 00:19:23.039
Right, Dacheng?

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.559
She's a good girl. Really.

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:25.200
Yeah.

00:19:25.279 --> 00:19:26.079
And these days,

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.759
every bride in Nanzhou

00:19:28.759 --> 00:19:30.960
asks for a new house.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.799
Right.

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:33.680
I think her parents' request

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.360
is reasonable.

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:39.600
The point is that Bichen

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.420
truly wants to build a life
with your brother.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.719
Zhixia,

00:19:43.999 --> 00:19:46.279
you're a mother too.

00:19:46.479 --> 00:19:48.360
When Jiao gets married in the future,

00:19:48.719 --> 00:19:51.160
are you not going to ask
the groom's side for a house?

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.239
If she agrees, I'm fine with it.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.360
Don't you have any requests?

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.279
My only request is
not to live off the parents.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:04.920
Zhixia,

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:08.039
are you saying I live off the parents?

00:20:09.759 --> 00:20:11.120
How am I living off them?

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.680
Mom,

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.160
when I first started working,

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.360
did I send money back every month?

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:21.479
- Uh...
- Fine.

00:20:21.719 --> 00:20:22.550
Let's put that aside.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.079
When I graduated, I wanted to partner
with friends to sell that sports brand.

00:20:27.079 --> 00:20:28.920
You all said you were afraid
I'd get scammed.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.840
And before that,

00:20:30.039 --> 00:20:32.319
when I applied for Physical Education,

00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:33.880
you wouldn't let me go to Beijing.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.200
- You made me stay in Nanzhou.
- Yes. Don't get worked up.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.740
Now I only make
this little fixed salary.

00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:38.880
I have no savings.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.039
Bichen is such a good girl.

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:41.120
Can I let her go?

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.039
Can I not marry her?

00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:42.279
No.

00:20:42.279 --> 00:20:43.740
You're acting like
you're the reasonable one?

00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:45.479
You can't even take care of yourself.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.519
We didn't let you go to Beijing

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:48.450
because you would've
just become a burden there.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.479
Fine.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.680
Xu Zhixia,

00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:56.360
don't interfere in my life from now on.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.719
Xu Zhidong,

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.880
you'd better remember
what you just said.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.759
- Zhixia.
- Zhixia.

00:21:03.759 --> 00:21:04.759
I will.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.360
You!

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.160
Don't snap at your sister.

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:11.999
Does "living off" sound nice to you?

00:21:11.999 --> 00:21:13.319
No, it doesn't.

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:14.960
If an outsider said that about me,
I'd accept it.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.640
But my own sister said it to my face.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.200
Okay.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.079
- I...
- Okay.

00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:19.759
Don't be mad.

00:21:27.559 --> 00:21:28.360
Bichen.

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:31.680
Your face has been glowing lately.

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:33.960
Are you soon getting married?

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.079
Yeah. Our families have met.

00:21:36.079 --> 00:21:37.120
The talk went pretty well.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.680
I'm so jealous of you.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:43.120
I still think the breakfast here

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.740
is way worse than breakfast in Shanghai.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.080
But this is the only decent place
in the whole of Nanzhou.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:47.840
Really?

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.120
This is my first time here.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.239
When it first opened, a lot of people came.

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:53.999
Nanzhou is so boring.

00:21:55.479 --> 00:21:57.160
My brother used to tell me

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.200
to go wherever I want

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.519
and fly as high as I wish to.
He'll support the family.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.559
But look.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.759
He couldn't keep his promise

00:22:05.999 --> 00:22:07.640
this time.

00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:10.400
Your brother was really good to you.

00:22:10.719 --> 00:22:13.039
I remember you never
brought an umbrella.

00:22:13.319 --> 00:22:15.400
Every time it rained,
he'd show up to bring you one.

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:16.519
I did that on purpose.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.960
I wanted him to come.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.960
He'd bring me milk tea,
chicken wings, hot dogs,

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.160
and wait for me at the school gate.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.799
He always told me,

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.400
"Senior year is tough.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.279
Eat more meat to get through it."

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:33.759
My brother was the one person

00:22:33.759 --> 00:22:34.999
who treated me the best.

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:40.640
Meiqi, you didn't go to Shanghai
and stayed here to be with your parents.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.120
They must be happy, right?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.880
Not really.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.880
My dad nags me every day to get a job.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.039
My mom

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.840
is focused on the eldest grandchild now.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.960
She even gave our family's
heirloom jade bracelet

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.079
to my sister-in-law.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.479
But all her control is aimed at me.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.319
Every time I go out,

00:23:00.319 --> 00:23:01.559
she starts calling nonstop.

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:03.940
"Where are you? Who are you with?
When are you coming back?"

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:17.840
Hello, Mom?

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.600
Where are you, Feng Meiqi?

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.880
Where did you go so early?

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.200
I can't find you.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.840
I'm having breakfast with a friend
on Qingxi Road.

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:29.319
I cooked a bird's nest,
and you won't eat it.

00:23:29.319 --> 00:23:31.120
But you'll go outside
and eat junk instead.

00:23:31.719 --> 00:23:32.920
Come home now.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.120
I'll come back when I'm done.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.400
Okay. Listen.

00:23:36.479 --> 00:23:38.519
Send me your location when you leave.

00:23:39.079 --> 00:23:40.880
Hurry home. Be careful on the road.

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:45.640
See? I was right.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.519
Your mom was traumatized
after what happened to your brother.

00:23:50.519 --> 00:23:51.479
I know.

00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:53.120
That's why I always answer her calls.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.799
I'm scared she'll break down.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.460
Forget it. Let's not talk about it.

00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:21.319
Seriously?

00:24:21.999 --> 00:24:23.160
Feng Meiqi

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.840
is not replying to messages
or picking up calls.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.640
What's she trying to do?

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.239
Mingzhu, put it down.

00:24:30.279 --> 00:24:32.279
I'll do it. You have work to get to.

00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:33.200
Thank you.

00:24:36.999 --> 00:24:38.400
Mom, don't worry.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.960
Maybe Meiqi didn't hear the phone
on the way back.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.120
She keeps not picking up,

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:41.960
you know?

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.680
What if something happened?

00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:44.880
Feng Meiqi!

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.400
Where were you?

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.880
Why didn't you answer my calls?

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.079
Answer me.

00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:52.559
How am I supposed to answer
while biking?

00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:53.519
You kept calling.

00:24:53.519 --> 00:24:55.260
Even if I'm fine,
you'll make it a problem.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.279
- Mom.
- What attitude is that?

00:24:57.799 --> 00:24:58.960
Meiqi is just tired.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.319
Tired from what?

00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:01.960
She doesn't go to school or work.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.160
What's so tiring?

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.239
Who is she trying to show attitude to?

00:25:05.239 --> 00:25:06.559
We don't owe you anything.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.600
I owe you!

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:10.880
When my brother died, I broke down too.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.440
Did any of you care how I felt?

00:25:12.759 --> 00:25:14.600
I studied so hard all these years.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.840
From Shanghai to London.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.039
Halfway around the world.
And in the end?

00:25:18.319 --> 00:25:19.559
I'm right back there.

00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:20.719
I can't go anywhere.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.640
I can't even have a proper brunch.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.559
What do you mean?

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:25.160
We fed you, clothed you,

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.160
and we're the burden now?

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.559
You want to go to Shanghai, don't you?
Then go.

00:25:29.559 --> 00:25:30.440
No one's stopping you.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.680
Yes, no one's stopping me.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.999
Except you call me countless times a day
and track my location.

00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:35.999
How do I go to Shanghai like that?
How do I find a job?

00:25:35.999 --> 00:25:37.759
I call you because I care.

00:25:37.759 --> 00:25:38.880
I worry.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.799
If you care, then stop calling!

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:44.400
I'm a grown-up. I won't die or what.

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:45.719
Don't say that!

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:49.519
Don't.

00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:54.319
You have to be safe.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.440
You have to.

00:26:01.319 --> 00:26:02.120
- Mom.
- Mom.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.920
Calm down.

00:26:04.319 --> 00:26:05.719
Meiqi didn't mean it like that.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.680
Calm down.

00:26:08.279 --> 00:26:10.039
Meiqi, enough.

00:26:10.719 --> 00:26:12.319
If you want to go to Shanghai, go ahead.

00:26:12.319 --> 00:26:14.680
Shanghai isn't far away. I'm here.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.479
Except that you're here,

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.799
I'll be forgotten.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.479
Mom, don't get angry.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.600
It's alright.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.880
Have some water, Mom.

00:26:41.479 --> 00:26:43.200
I'm going to work then.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.200
Mingzhu.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.519
Sit down. I have something to say.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.079
Tell me.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.920
Are you short on money,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.600
or does your family need help?

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:04.239
If there's anything, you can talk to me.

00:27:04.239 --> 00:27:05.519
We're a family.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.999
There's no need to feel embarrassed.

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:10.479
Mom, I'm not short of money.

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:13.479
I just don't want to
stay at home all day.

00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:16.360
You can learn something

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.239
like flower arranging, tea ceremony,

00:27:20.719 --> 00:27:23.120
or sign up for a prenatal yoga class.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.160
Doing yoga

00:27:24.279 --> 00:27:26.120
is good for both you and the baby.

00:27:26.479 --> 00:27:28.160
When you marry into a family like ours,

00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:32.039
you need some skills
that are beyond living.

00:27:33.719 --> 00:27:35.479
Living is the most important skill.

00:27:35.999 --> 00:27:37.160
This is my job.

00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:39.999
I need to set an example for my child.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.719
With the peanut salary
you make every month,

00:27:43.719 --> 00:27:45.759
you can't even buy a pair of shoes
for the baby.

00:27:45.759 --> 00:27:47.400
What example are you setting?

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:53.039
What you need now is to calm down
and take care of the baby in your belly.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.799
I'll be careful.

00:27:58.759 --> 00:27:59.559
Careful!

00:28:01.319 --> 00:28:02.799
Careful with that bracelet.

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:04.440
It cost a hundred thousand.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.160
So expensive?

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.799
It was a hundred thousand
when we bought it.

00:28:07.799 --> 00:28:10.079
Who knows how much it's worth now?

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.719
But it's not about the money.

00:28:12.719 --> 00:28:14.479
It's an heirloom.

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:15.600
Priceless.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.079
I'll take better care of it.

00:28:21.719 --> 00:28:22.840
I'm going, Mom.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.400
Come back.

00:28:27.759 --> 00:28:28.999
You're walking out like that?

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.999
You're leaving with those thin clothes?

00:28:33.519 --> 00:28:34.799
Look at the weather today.

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:35.880
The wind is strong.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.279
What if you catch a cold?

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.759
The hotel has strong air-conditioning.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.120
That's useless.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.559
You're pregnant.

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:46.200
You need to take care of yourself.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.400
If you catch a chill,

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.680
you'll understand the consequences
when you're my age.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.559
Put on your pants

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:53.999
or at least wear socks.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.280
- Go on.
- Alright.

00:28:57.759 --> 00:28:58.559
Thick ones.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.680
Mom, look. I'm wearing thick socks.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.479
I'll get going.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.400
Be careful.

00:29:34.319 --> 00:29:35.120
What can you do?

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.440
Some people are just born to work.

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:39.519
She has a good life,

00:29:39.519 --> 00:29:41.039
but she insists on working.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.880
You can't stop her.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.039
Being a rich housewife
or a working adult,

00:29:46.719 --> 00:29:48.039
it's her choice.

00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:50.400
What's with you today?

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.039
You're taking her side.

00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:57.039
Are you upset

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.479
because I gave her the bracelet?

00:30:00.239 --> 00:30:01.519
I am upset.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:03.319
But that's a separate matter.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.239
What do you mean?

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.559
What happened?

00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:12.640
How did you get hurt?

00:30:13.239 --> 00:30:14.759
I was riding a shared bike,

00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:15.799
and you kept calling.

00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:17.079
So I got distracted and fell.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.039
Now you're blaming me?

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.799
How could you be so careless?

00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:22.150
You're a grown-up, and you still fall.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.319
That's on you.

00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:25.640
You have a car.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.319
Why did you ride a shared bike?

00:30:27.319 --> 00:30:28.519
That doesn't suit you.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.319
Let me put some medicine on it.

00:30:31.319 --> 00:30:32.079
I already did.

00:30:32.079 --> 00:30:33.160
Don't let it get infected.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.160
I already did.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.120
Good thing
you didn't give me that bracelet.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.910
Otherwise, I would've broken it
when I fell.

00:30:50.079 --> 00:30:50.960
Meiqi,

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.519
I know

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.719
you've been unhappy

00:30:57.719 --> 00:30:59.640
since I gave the heirloom bracelet
to Mingzhu.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.799
Whether I give it to you or not,
you're still my daughter.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.039
But Mingzhu is different.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.680
She's my daughter-in-law.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.279
You know how hard it is to get along
between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.

00:31:16.039 --> 00:31:17.400
If your brother were still here,

00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:21.479
there would be a buffer.

00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:23.960
But he's not.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.440
So how am I supposed to show goodwill?

00:31:33.759 --> 00:31:36.120
Think about it this way.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.479
Even though the bracelet
is on Mingzhu's wrist now,

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.239
it's still going

00:31:43.719 --> 00:31:45.680
to end up with your nephew,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.920
my grandson.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.880
Let me tell you the truth.

00:31:56.999 --> 00:31:59.680
I was never sitting around
at home every day.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.799
I actually had a high chance
at that job offer in Shanghai.

00:32:02.999 --> 00:32:04.160
But you...

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.319
I couldn't leave you and Dad.

00:32:08.279 --> 00:32:10.519
I'm your only support now.

00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:11.279
So

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.200
I came back.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.640
My sweetheart.

00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:25.440
Thank you.

00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:30.239
- Thank you, Meiqi.
- Don't cry.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.400
Don't cry. So annoying.

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:49.640
These are meal vouchers from our hotel.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.880
When you go home,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.360
give them to your relatives and friends.

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:55.999
Ask them to come by

00:32:56.239 --> 00:32:58.600
and try our signature dishes.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.400
Come. Everyone, take some.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:01.160
Here you go.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.719
Mr. Zhao, why are we getting assignments
for these vouchers?

00:33:03.999 --> 00:33:04.759
Exactly.

00:33:04.759 --> 00:33:06.319
The KPI is too heavy.

00:33:07.079 --> 00:33:07.920
KPI?

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.479
We're mobilizing all the staff now.

00:33:09.719 --> 00:33:11.840
Here. Give out more.
Give them to your friends.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.680
Tell them to come.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.319
Alright.

00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:15.400
Hand them out.

00:33:18.279 --> 00:33:19.079
Mingzhu.

00:33:24.239 --> 00:33:25.079
Here's the thing.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.999
Our department

00:33:27.999 --> 00:33:29.200
hasn't hit the sales target.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.799
So I was thinking,

00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:35.400
if you could talk to Mr. Feng,

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.840
see if he can help us a little
by recharging his dining card.

00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:41.650
Tens of thousands would be enough.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.559
He's a businessman, anyway.

00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:44.640
He treats clients to meals.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.999
He can have the meals here.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.519
If he comes here,

00:33:47.559 --> 00:33:48.960
we'll give him great service.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.999
That's not really appropriate.

00:33:52.759 --> 00:33:54.999
Right now, my mother-in-law and I...

00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:55.759
Mingzhu.

00:33:58.759 --> 00:33:59.719
I know

00:33:59.999 --> 00:34:01.039
it's not very decent

00:34:01.319 --> 00:34:02.600
to bring this up.

00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:05.239
But our hotel's business is really bad,

00:34:05.239 --> 00:34:06.120
you know?

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.020
Otherwise, why would we mobilize
the whole staff?

00:34:08.039 --> 00:34:09.079
I'm under

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:11.240
a lot of pressure, you know?

00:34:11.559 --> 00:34:12.800
At times like this,

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.679
we should all pull together,

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:15.119
right?

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:17.159
Let's get through this together,

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.119
okay?

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.639
Well.

00:34:22.039 --> 00:34:24.280
I'll ask my father-in-law first.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.320
Oh, right. And also
your relatives and friends.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.159
Ask around.

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.559
Ask whoever you can ask.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.800
We've been coworkers for years.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.960
No one wants to see

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:35.960
this hotel fall apart.

00:34:38.039 --> 00:34:38.960
I understand.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.400
Shredded pork with garlic sauce.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.119
Madam, bill, please.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.079
Coming.

00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:48.240
Hello, what would you like?

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:49.999
One order of Shen's pork chop.

00:34:49.999 --> 00:34:51.639
Shen's pork chop.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.999
Dad, we still have pork chops?

00:34:55.999 --> 00:34:57.119
Sold out.

00:34:57.639 --> 00:34:58.559
I'm so sorry.

00:34:59.199 --> 00:35:00.519
How about smoked fish instead?

00:35:00.519 --> 00:35:01.800
It's also our specialty.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.880
Okay. One smoked fish then.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.599
- Mr. Shen.
- Sure. Smoked fish.

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:06.880
I want smoked fish too.

00:35:06.999 --> 00:35:08.119
You're back, Mingzhu.

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:11.199
Why didn't you call before coming home?

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:12.599
Do you need anything else?

00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:13.920
- One order of Shen's stir-fried pork.
- Are you hungry?

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.039
I'm hungry. I came home for free lunch.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.920
Our young miss is home.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.720
The usual three dishes?

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.039
Alright.

00:35:19.039 --> 00:35:19.840
Wait here.

00:35:19.999 --> 00:35:21.720
Boss, bill.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.639
Coming.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.679
I'll do it.

00:35:24.479 --> 00:35:26.920
That'll be 108 yuan.

00:35:27.159 --> 00:35:29.159
I'll waive the change.
Just give me 100.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.559
Alright? If you like the food,
come again.

00:35:30.559 --> 00:35:31.039
Of course.

00:35:31.039 --> 00:35:32.519
You really look like a boss.

00:35:32.519 --> 00:35:33.800
Obviously.

00:35:34.039 --> 00:35:34.920
You know what?

00:35:35.039 --> 00:35:37.720
I'm going to be a big boss
in the future.

00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:40.400
How about getting into college first?

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:42.479
There are more?

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:44.250
Didn't you say
you sold out the pork chops?

00:35:44.999 --> 00:35:47.440
Your dad saved you a piece.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.199
Oh please.

00:35:48.199 --> 00:35:49.159
Why would he save me one?

00:35:49.159 --> 00:35:50.960
You just lost 15 yuan.

00:35:52.479 --> 00:35:53.599
You're greedy.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.599
Come, Minghui.

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:56.159
- Eat this.
- No.

00:35:56.159 --> 00:35:57.199
- Mingzhu.
- You eat.

00:35:57.199 --> 00:35:58.280
You eat it.

00:35:59.039 --> 00:36:00.240
I eat this every day.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.999
You barely come back.
You should have it.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.519
Delicious.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.639
Come home for lunch every day.

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:16.199
You can call ahead,
and your dad will cook for you.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.039
Okay.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.599
Mingzhu.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.960
How have you been living over there
lately?

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.900
Is everything all right?

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.320
Pretty good.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.039
It's just that Jianqi's mom
treats me like a kid.

00:36:30.999 --> 00:36:31.920
It was hot today.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.039
She insisted I wear
fleece-lined tights.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.800
I'm pregnant
and my temperature is high.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.679
I was sweating.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.800
They always cook shark fin, sea cucumber,
abalone, and bird's nest.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.559
They want me to eat five meals a day.

00:36:43.679 --> 00:36:44.760
I'm not showing yet,

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.240
but my weight is shooting up.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.119
The only thing that's not good is

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.559
that they don't knock.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.750
They just punch in the door password
and come right in.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.599
I have to be fully dressed
all the time in my own house.

00:36:57.679 --> 00:36:59.639
What's wrong with that family?

00:36:59.639 --> 00:37:00.999
She promised

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:02.479
she'd take good care of Mingzhu.

00:37:02.479 --> 00:37:03.520
But look how it turned out.

00:37:04.199 --> 00:37:05.400
She has no freedom at all.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.559
Like she's in prison.

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:07.599
It's not that bad.

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:08.559
Don't exaggerate.

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:09.720
Don't exaggerate?

00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:11.810
If you find it uncomfortable,
move back home.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.840
I just moved over there.

00:37:14.159 --> 00:37:16.320
It's fine. Everything else is okay.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.639
What's wrong?

00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:24.119
I was scared.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.230
Jianqi's mom said this bracelet
cost a hundred thousand.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.639
How much?

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:32.270
She said it was a hundred thousand
when they bought it.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.320
A hundred thousand?

00:37:33.479 --> 00:37:35.440
How many pork chops would that be?

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.900
It was a hundred thousand back then.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.639
How much is it now?

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.840
That's why I wear it
so carefully every day.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.639
Jianqi's mom is quite annoying.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.400
But she's doing it for your own good.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.800
Wool leggings are nothing.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.240
If it's hot, just let it be.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.639
It won't hurt you, anyway.

00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:52.360
After all,

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.360
she gave you

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.440
a family heirloom.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.159
Right?

00:37:57.159 --> 00:37:57.880
Mom,

00:37:58.479 --> 00:38:00.320
why are you changing your tune so fast?

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.119
Yeah.

00:38:01.559 --> 00:38:03.519
You change your attitude
because of the money.

00:38:03.519 --> 00:38:04.400
Shut up.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:05.850
Don't talk about your mom like that.

00:38:06.119 --> 00:38:07.999
Your mom

00:38:08.999 --> 00:38:10.679
does like money.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.400
But what she cares about most
is the "family heirloom."

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.159
Exactly.

00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:17.079
That's not something
people give out casually.

00:38:17.079 --> 00:38:19.159
It means she does value your sister.

00:38:19.159 --> 00:38:19.960
That's right.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.679
1,760.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.679
So that's

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.119
130,000.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.840
130,000.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.760
130,000

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.479
minus 3,000.

00:38:36.199 --> 00:38:37.280
3,000.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.960
No. 2,000.

00:38:38.999 --> 00:38:41.800
We can't use that 2,000.
That's our living expenses.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.559
2,000.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.039
Xu Dacheng,

00:38:44.039 --> 00:38:45.999
go to sleep in the bed.

00:38:45.999 --> 00:38:47.559
Don't snore here.

00:38:47.559 --> 00:38:48.800
You're distracting me.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.079
I'm not sleeping.

00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:53.360
I'm here keeping you company.

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:58.119
You keep counting
the little money we have.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.760
It's not going to magically grow.

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.639
We need to fund Zhidong,

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.760
Mingzhu,

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.479
and Zhixia.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.360
Zhixia contributed the most.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.999
We need to take care of her too.

00:39:17.679 --> 00:39:19.479
My heart is split into
three equal pieces.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.599
You're the one to talk.

00:39:25.199 --> 00:39:29.119
Even if your heart is in eight pieces,

00:39:29.639 --> 00:39:32.639
your money only goes to your son.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.960
Go ahead and stir things up.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.199
Xu Dacheng, you're laughing?

00:39:38.199 --> 00:39:39.320
What's so funny?

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.920
It's not good if the kids hear you.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.679
All three of them
are my flesh and blood.

00:39:45.679 --> 00:39:46.920
I love them all.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.639
Right?

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.999
Did I give Zhixia money
when she got married?

00:39:52.559 --> 00:39:53.920
Did I give her money and help her

00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:55.840
when she had Jiao?

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.159
Mingzhu...

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.840
I wanted to give her money,

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.960
but would she take it?

00:40:03.519 --> 00:40:05.920
Now it's Zhidong getting married.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.760
That's the most important matter now.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.519
But I can't take out money anymore.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.320
What am I supposed to do?

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.599
Xu Dacheng,

00:40:23.479 --> 00:40:24.760
you're the father.

00:40:25.519 --> 00:40:27.559
Take the money out of your pocket.

00:40:28.479 --> 00:40:29.280
Take it out.

00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:35.639
I'm a good-for-nothing,

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.039
is that enough?

00:40:44.519 --> 00:40:46.079
Look at the Feng family.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.920
They have big houses, luxury cars,

00:40:49.479 --> 00:40:51.599
and a family heirloom jade bracelet.

00:40:52.679 --> 00:40:54.559
We don't have any of that.

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.599
You have a good husband
and two good children.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:59.350
How can you say we have nothing?

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.559
It's always miserable

00:41:00.559 --> 00:41:01.840
when you compare.

00:41:03.199 --> 00:41:04.440
We don't have a luxury car,

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.039
but we can have a bracelet, right?

00:41:08.119 --> 00:41:08.920
Yeah, Dad.

00:41:09.199 --> 00:41:10.479
Let's go buy one now.

00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:12.199
Right now?

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.350
Don't start trouble.
Go upstairs and do your homework.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.519
Dad said it.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.519
We can have a bracelet.

00:41:17.519 --> 00:41:18.280
Right, Dad?

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.440
Yes. Let's go.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.920
Do your homework.
Don't make trouble here.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:21.800
No, Mom.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.599
What are you doing?

00:41:22.599 --> 00:41:23.950
Dad already said it. Let's go now.

00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:25.920
We're starting from zero.

00:41:26.679 --> 00:41:28.519
You're the ancestor now.

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:29.760
- Stop joking around.
- Let's go.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.479
Ancestor.

00:41:30.479 --> 00:41:32.119
Stop messing around.

00:41:32.119 --> 00:41:32.800
Come on, Mom.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.479
Let's go right now.

00:41:33.479 --> 00:41:34.320
I'm working.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.760
Working on what? Come on. Stop working.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.559
You scared me.

00:42:12.559 --> 00:42:13.159
Oh my.

00:42:13.159 --> 00:42:16.519
Look at that "A Harmonious Family
Brings Prosperity".

00:42:17.199 --> 00:42:18.519
Well said.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:25.360
Is this some "Three Kingdoms" strategy?

00:42:26.199 --> 00:42:27.479
Are you a lobbyist?

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.360
What lobbyist?

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.639
What "Three Kingdoms"?

00:42:32.639 --> 00:42:33.479
We're family.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.650
We have six kingdoms instead.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.119
Come on in.

00:42:39.559 --> 00:42:40.199
