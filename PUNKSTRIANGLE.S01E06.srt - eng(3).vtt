00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.833
It's AE! He's so cool! Seriously amazing.

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:16.583
Fantastic!

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:19.125
Perfect.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.625
- This one's great.
- That one's awesome, too.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.042
Thanks!

00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:24.875
- So handsome!
- Oh, nice.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.958
You've got such an ethereal vibe today.

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:28.375
Thank you.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.060
That twitch in your throat, are you OK?

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:43.375
- So cool...
- Perfect! This one's amazing.

00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:51.792
Perfect, that was really great!

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:53.083
Thanks.

00:00:54.167 --> 00:00:56.708
Great work. Today's shoot was fantastic.

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:59.684
Everyone was raving about you. They
said your dreamy expression was incredible.

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:00.792
Oh, really?

00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:04.167
By the way, isn't the school's design
competition the day after tomorrow?

00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:07.042
I've cleared your entire
schedule for that day.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:10.333
Please, whatever you do, don't
let anyone find out you're AE.

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:14.417
Also, about next month's schedule...
I'll send it to you later.

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:16.417
- Got it.
- Thanks for your help.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.500
AE, great work.

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:34.958
Saeki-san.

00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:42.250
Did something happen... with that guy?

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:51.667
That expression of yours was both sexy and
sad... it didn't look like you were just working.

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:55.750
You looked completely heartbroken.

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:06.875
But the reason it all
fell apart... it's all my fault.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.250
I'm doing the one thing that
would hurt him the most right now.

00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:20.917
Looks like you're in
full-on lovesick idiot mode.

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:23.083
Something like that.

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:24.893
I don't know what's
going on between you two.

00:02:24.917 --> 00:02:26.434
But you still have the
competition to prepare for.

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:29.417
Being lovesick on top of
that is a recipe for disaster.

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:34.000
You'll end up getting torn to shreds.

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:36.667
You're right.

00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:42.167
Anyway, try not to overthink it for now.

00:02:42.292 --> 00:02:43.542
Okay.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:46.417
But you know... being foolish
enough to love someone that much...

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:48.458
is actually kind of romantic.

00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.042
I want a love like that, too.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:56.875
Alright, see ya.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.750
Good work.

00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:02.250
Great work! Bye-bye!

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:12.458
Right now, I just have to
focus on the competition.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:33.083
It's been three months
since I last heard from him...

00:03:41.625 --> 00:03:42.500
"Thanks for yesterday! I had a great time."

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:45.434
"I completely blacked out for the
second half. I must've been wasted, sorry!"

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:47.738
"If you're up for it... I'd
like to hear what you think."

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:55.833
No, no, I have to focus on the competition.

00:03:57.583 --> 00:03:59.417
To make my dream come true!

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:20.750
AE!?

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:11.417
AE!

00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:17.083
Chiaki...

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.292
"PUNKS△TRIANGLE"
(Episode 6)

00:06:34.833 --> 00:06:37.708
- Wh-What do I do?
- What am I going to do...

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:40.792
I called out to him on impulse.

00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:44.667
And now I'm completely speechless...

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:49.292
I really need to apologize to him soon.

00:06:49.417 --> 00:06:52.417
The competition is the day after tomorrow.

00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:54.833
Of all the times to run into him.

00:06:55.458 --> 00:07:00.417
Chiaki is a model, so I don't want to
give him anything extra to worry about.

00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:16.083
I can't... He's too handsome.

00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:23.625
Take your time, Chiaki.

00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:31.417
I'm sorry. I promised
I wouldn't drink too much next time.

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:33.792
It's fine if you drink a lot.

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:36.750
I just don't want you to push yourself.

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:46.958
How did you recognize me so quickly?

00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:51.083
Of course I'd recognize you.

00:07:52.042 --> 00:07:55.250
The way you walk...

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:02.417
It's because it's you.

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:04.833
The way I walk?

00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:10.917
I really love the way you walk.

00:08:11.042 --> 00:08:13.500
I've watched you so many
times, so I recognized it instantly.

00:08:15.458 --> 00:08:17.792
No matter how big the crowd is...

00:08:17.917 --> 00:08:19.917
if it's you walking...

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:24.042
I would never get it wrong.

00:08:36.417 --> 00:08:39.833
Right, about that time with Enaga...

00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:46.125
He was deliberately slouching
when he walked to keep a low profile.

00:08:49.042 --> 00:08:50.542
Could it be...

00:08:51.458 --> 00:08:56.417
The look in your eyes... and the way
you walked... like you were on a runway.

00:08:56.542 --> 00:08:58.625
It was so cool...

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:04.375
So that's why... Chiaki's runway
walk is so good. It's because...

00:09:05.458 --> 00:09:08.167
The reason he can walk so beautifully...

00:09:08.292 --> 00:09:12.542
is because he secretly copied
my walk over and over again...

00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:14.125
Like this...

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.042
It's... it's creepy, isn't it?

00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:23.583
I said something weird again...

00:09:25.083 --> 00:09:26.333
Um...

00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:28.042
About last time, I'm really...

00:09:30.833 --> 00:09:32.000
I'm sorry!

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:35.292
Ah...

00:09:35.417 --> 00:09:37.500
Wow, that's a pretty
artistic-looking spill.

00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:39.458
I'm so sorry!

00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:44.167
Are you okay? I'm really sorry!

00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:58.375
This stuff works wonders
on red wine and liquor stains.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.917
Oh, really?

00:10:00.042 --> 00:10:02.708
Just let it soak for a few
minutes, then rinse it with water.

00:10:02.833 --> 00:10:05.542
Then blow-dry it, and you're all set.

00:10:07.083 --> 00:10:08.750
Leave it to me.

00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:11.500
I'll get it perfectly clean for you.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.833
Chiaki.

00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.292
Where exactly are you planning to wash it?

00:10:18.042 --> 00:10:21.167
Oh, right...

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.208
S-Sorry.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.000
I was just panicking.

00:10:28.583 --> 00:10:31.833
It's okay. I wanted to
talk to you more anyway.

00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:36.875
I can just use this to
wash it when I get home.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.250
No, wait!

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.125
I... I want to talk with
you a little longer.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.875
Chiaki.

00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:53.750
Um...

00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:57.917
Is there a faucet nearby?

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.042
What about that hotel?

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:10.333
Huh?

00:11:12.792 --> 00:11:15.684
The sign says "Rest." I guess it's a
hotel where you can just rest for a bit.

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:17.458
Chiaki, this is a...

00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:22.125
Okay, let's dry your shirt here.

00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:27.458
Chiaki.

00:11:29.458 --> 00:11:32.708
Do you know what a love hotel is?

00:11:33.583 --> 00:11:35.167
A love hotel!?

00:11:36.201 --> 00:11:40.826
It's a place where
couples go to... you know.

00:11:42.292 --> 00:11:47.292
Me... I'm okay with it if I'm with you.

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:50.417
But are you?

00:11:55.292 --> 00:11:56.833
Just kidding.

00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.375
Let's just find a business hotel.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.667
I... I'm okay with it, too.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.083
Huh?

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.083
Let's hurry inside.

00:12:09.208 --> 00:12:11.000
Otherwise, the stain will set.

00:12:12.417 --> 00:12:13.792
Huh...

00:12:15.833 --> 00:12:18.083
This is all so sudden.

00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958
If I weren't Enaga...

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:34.167
- This bed is huge!
- If my name wasn't AE...

00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:37.333
There are so many light switches.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.583
And the TV is massive!

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.125
I want to hug him right now.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.833
Hm?

00:12:48.108 --> 00:12:50.183
What kind of tea is this?
I've never seen it before.

00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:52.875
That's lubricant.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.375
Lubricant!

00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:04.875
To think I'm in a place
like this with my bias...

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.833
So, what now?

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.542
Um... please take off your shirt.

00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:16.833
Ah! For the stain!

00:13:20.875 --> 00:13:25.125
Chiaki, you're so cute. I get it.

00:13:50.333 --> 00:13:52.500
Okay, it's off.

00:13:58.917 --> 00:14:01.208
My bias's naked body!

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.375
Chiaki, are you okay?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.375
Oh, AE, you have a belly button piercing.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.875
Crap.

00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:20.583
Oh, Enaga has a belly
button piercing, too...

00:14:21.292 --> 00:14:23.750
This situation is way too similar.

00:14:25.583 --> 00:14:27.167
Um...

00:14:28.042 --> 00:14:31.958
You have a belly button
piercing. A friend of mine does, too.

00:14:32.917 --> 00:14:37.125
Belly button piercings are
so cool. It really suits you.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.250
Chiaki...

00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.750
Sorry! I'll go wash the stain now.

00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:09.000
Sorry, it just needs
to soak a little longer.

00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:10.375
Thanks.

00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.042
A bathrobe!

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:21.833
This is so seductive.

00:15:23.708 --> 00:15:25.748
This feels like something
out of an American movie.

00:15:27.792 --> 00:15:28.875
Hm?

00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:34.833
Um... AE.

00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.875
Today, too...

00:15:52.417 --> 00:15:56.000
Every time we meet, I
just cause trouble for you.

00:15:57.708 --> 00:15:59.292
I'm really sorry.

00:16:03.042 --> 00:16:04.917
The last time we saw each other,

00:16:05.951 --> 00:16:07.951
I don't remember it very clearly...

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:14.292
I threw up, and you took care of me.

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:20.750
I've been wanting to
apologize to you for that.

00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:27.375
That's not something
you need to apologize for.

00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:30.167
Huh?

00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:35.125
Chiaki, I know you can't hold your liquor.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.000
I should have stopped
you from drinking more.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.708
Then... why didn't you answer my messages?

00:16:51.208 --> 00:16:52.792
That was because...

00:16:55.333 --> 00:16:59.417
Have I... been putting him in a
difficult position this whole time?

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.458
You don't have to tell me why!

00:17:05.333 --> 00:17:09.250
I just... I really wanted to apologize.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.917
Chiaki...

00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:14.542
Then can I...

00:17:17.833 --> 00:17:20.250
Can I ask for something selfish?

00:17:21.667 --> 00:17:23.000
Something selfish?

00:17:24.625 --> 00:17:29.958
Please... leave a memory on me.

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:31.208
Huh?

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.451
I want... you to give me a piercing.

00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:50.542
You want me... to pierce your ear?

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:56.583
I got my lip pierced because of you.

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:58.000
Every time I touch it,

00:17:59.667 --> 00:18:04.833
I remember the moment I first saw you.

00:18:06.375 --> 00:18:11.750
So whenever I feel anxious, I touch it.

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:16.667
And it gives me courage.

00:18:19.667 --> 00:18:21.625
That's why...

00:18:22.333 --> 00:18:25.750
I've been thinking that if I
ever got to see you again,

00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:28.333
I'd ask you to give me a new one.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.917
That way, I can always remember...

00:18:36.042 --> 00:18:41.417
the memory of this... night out with you.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.833
Is that... not okay?

00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.417
Okay.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.000
Where do you want it?

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.958
Um...

00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:17.333
I want to get one just like yours...

00:19:18.083 --> 00:19:19.542
right here.

00:19:40.417 --> 00:19:43.292
Is this spot okay?

00:19:46.208 --> 00:19:47.667
Let me just sanitize it for you.

00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:57.917
This is probably... the
last time we'll ever meet.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.625
The moment I saw the
hesitation on his face... I knew.

00:20:07.417 --> 00:20:12.833
He must have tons of fans like me.

00:20:15.042 --> 00:20:20.875
He's not the kind of person to
say, "I don't want to see you,"

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.417
or "You're annoying."

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:30.792
I don't think we'll ever
have another night like this.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.958
Ready? Here I go.

00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:38.542
Never... again.

00:20:41.792 --> 00:20:42.875
Mmm...

00:20:44.167 --> 00:20:45.583
Just try to relax.

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.958
You okay? Does it hurt?

00:20:54.083 --> 00:20:56.292
I'm... I'm okay.

00:21:01.208 --> 00:21:03.750
Okay, I'm pushing it through.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.083
Ah... AE.

00:21:35.125 --> 00:21:36.542
Are you all right?

00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:41.667
Mmm-hmm...

00:21:43.839 --> 00:21:51.839
This way... he'll always be on my body.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:17.583
Chiaki...

00:22:19.833 --> 00:22:21.333
Now we match.

00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:25.792
Yeah...

00:22:35.785 --> 00:22:40.118
Do you... like me in that way?

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.583
AE?

00:22:47.542 --> 00:22:50.542
It's okay. You're cute.

00:23:20.125 --> 00:23:22.083
So... is that a no?

00:23:22.875 --> 00:23:24.167
That's not it.

00:23:30.625 --> 00:23:33.875
Let's go, Chiaki.

00:23:51.125 --> 00:23:54.833
What do I do? I have to say something.

00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:56.625
I can't just stay silent.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.833
I can't let it end like this.

00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:00.875
I can't just let him walk away...

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.625
I'm heading out.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.417
Go home and get some rest, okay, Chiaki?

00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:21.434
(Next Episode Preview)
We can never go back to how things were.

00:24:21.458 --> 00:24:23.208
All I can think about is AE.

00:24:23.333 --> 00:24:25.042
Damn it! We lost.

00:24:25.167 --> 00:24:25.750
What now?

00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:26.625
The way I walk...

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.559
He must have watched me
so many times. I just know it.

00:24:28.583 --> 00:24:29.583
AE...
