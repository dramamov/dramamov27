00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.010
Enjoy your meal, Mother.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.510
You must have been tired
from all that shopping, right?

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.380
If anyone was tired,
it must have been you.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.920
Seriously, how much does one have to shop
to become a Black Sapphire member?

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.190
It's nothing, really.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.890
For me, spending money is
the easiest thing in the world.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.840
Oh, come on.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.670
You should let your grandmother eat first.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.450
It's all right.
It just means she's enjoying the food.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.420
Eat up, Se Ri.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.120
Here, Se Ri.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.390
Try a bite of this.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.430
Goodness. You eat so well.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.000
Say "thank you" to your grandma.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.900
Seriously, cut it out!

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.050
Wait, who's that?

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.690
Isn't that Kyung Chae and Se Ri?

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.060
But the woman with them is...

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.100
Why is Madam Jang...

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.940
meeting with Min Kyung Chae and Min Se Ri?

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.780
Should we go over and say hi?

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.880
No.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.550
- Don't.
- Okay.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.700
Maybe it's because
she's my son's flesh and blood,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.740
but I feel completely different
about her now.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.240
I'm sure you do. I feel the same way.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.080
Before, you were just a business contact.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.350
But now, as the mother of the man I loved,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.920
you're especially dear to me.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.590
- Am I really that dear to you?
- Of course.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.260
Don't you feel the same?
Se Ri and I are your family now.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.660
Family...

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.800
Kyung Chae!

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.640
Can we go now?
We ate. Why did we have to come here?

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.470
Is that all there is to a meal?
We're having tea.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.380
You're having some too.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.880
Tea? No thanks. Maybe some alcohol...

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.050
You drink?

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.450
I'm not a minor, you know.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.330
Is this man your son?

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.200
Yes, he is. Why do you ask?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Just wondering.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.800
He seems familiar for some reason.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.570
He seems familiar?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.510
Blood recognizes its own.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.850
How do you feel, looking at him?

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.280
What kind of person do you think he is?

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.420
He's just a guy, I guess.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.850
But he looks really kind.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.220
He seems like a good person.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.090
My sweet girl.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.630
- My sweet girl!
- Come on, Grandma!

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.100
My sweet girl.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.790
For Madam Jang to be
meeting them in private...

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.490
What could be going on?

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.940
So? What did our stepmother say?

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.770
Is she going to make me the CEO?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.510
Just be patient.
I really buttered her up for you today.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.980
She didn't get angry, did she,
when you asked her to make me CEO?

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.620
No, she just said okay,
and that she'd think about it.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.020
That's a good start.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.350
If she thinks about it, I'm obviously
the right person for the job.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.830
You can't put ambitious types like
Soo Jung or Kyung Chae in high positions.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.730
They'll do anything to climb even higher.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.430
And before you know it,
they'll run the company into the ground.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.210
Madam Jang met with Min Kyung Chae
and Min Se Ri?

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.710
Yes.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.810
What could that have been about?

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.680
Something about it felt off.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.420
The atmosphere was so strange.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.850
They seemed just like a real family.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.150
A family?

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.660
The way Madam Jang
treated that girl, Se Ri,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.260
wasn't normal.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.460
It was like she was her granddaughter.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.430
Her own granddaughter? That's a stretch.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.570
Madam Jang can't stand her.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.340
I know, but yesterday,
it was totally different.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.410
To find out what's really going on,

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.610
we'll just have to ask her directly.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.480
You should go see Madam Jang.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.110
If there's something going on,
I'm sure she'll tell you the truth.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.930
This is a surprise. What brings you here?

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.230
I was still worried about you
since you were sick the other day.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.160
That was ages ago.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.100
I shouldn't have made you worry.
You're so busy.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.300
I'm alright, so don't worry about me.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.840
By any chance, did you go out yesterday?

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.850
No. I was at the hotel all day.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.510
Oh, really?

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.980
Why?

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.450
It's nothing. Never mind.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.330
So she's hiding the fact
that she went out?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.600
And she even lied,
saying she was at the hotel all day.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.940
But why would she hide that?

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.240
She's free to meet with anyone she wants,
whether it's Min Kyung Chae or not, right?

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.740
Madam Jang has never acted
like this before.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.580
I'm just so thrown off
by her sudden change.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.480
I know.
Doesn't she hate those two the most?

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.390
Come to think of it, something strange
did happen a few days ago.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.020
The night of the online team dinner,

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.920
Tae Joo came to my place
to meet with Min Kyung Chae.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.030
Wait, why would he...

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.930
Maybe all of this
isn't a coincidence after all.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.950
So, this is all Se Ri?

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.950
Look...

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.890
how much she looks like Ho Se?

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.760
Well...

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.190
Maybe it's because she's a newborn,

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.030
I don't really see the resemblance.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.200
But my Se Ri...

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.400
is Ho Se's only flesh and blood.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.070
She is your one and only granddaughter.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.970
But that very child is calling
Lucia "Mom."

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.340
Do you really think it's right that she's
bonding with Lucia instead of me?

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.750
You know what kind of person Lucia is
better than I do.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.720
How long are you going to
just stand by and watch?

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.590
When I get back to the company
and reclaim the CEO position,

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.230
I'll kick Lucia right out of the company
and the house.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.930
Once I own Mingang Distribution,
I'm going to pass it down to my Se Ri.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.930
That's why you have to help me.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.000
Please, help me, Mother.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.370
Whatever our relationship has been,
the important thing is...

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.040
that your bloodline
runs through Se Ri, not Lucia.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.810
Are you really going to stand by
and watch Se Ri's life be ruined?

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.450
If you promise...

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.890
to leave Mingang to Se Ri,

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.590
then, as her grandmother,
I might consider it.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.360
But if not...

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.660
What do you mean by that?

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.160
You're marrying Kim Sun Jae soon,
aren't you?

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.560
You're already engaged.
Marriage is the next logical step.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.700
Then you'll have children with him, too.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.300
I told you this last time.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.870
I have no intention of marrying him.
In fact, I won't.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.810
I'm just keeping him around for now
because he's useful.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.010
I'll drop him the second
I don't need him anymore.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.920
So what you want is to be CEO again?

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:05.480
Yes.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.860
What is it?

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.760
Speaking as the head of Legal,

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.700
how long do you plan to leave
the CEO position vacant?

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.340
A prolonged vacancy creates
a leadership vacuum,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.140
operational disruptions,
a weaker strategic direction,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.670
and a whole host of other problems.
You're aware of that, right?

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.380
I'm aware.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.080
If you knew that,
why have you been sitting on it?

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.720
I believe I made it clear I'm speaking
as the head of Legal.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.990
I was just about to name a successor,
actually.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.890
And just a friendly tip,

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.260
according to our company the Articles
of Incorporation, the CEO position...

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.730
can only be filled by a member
of the owner family, as you well know.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.370
I'm well aware. You don't need to worry.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.800
If this drags on any longer,
the shareholders will be notified.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.140
They'll be told that the acting chairman
is delaying the appointment of a new CEO,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.240
leaving the position vacant
and causing massive business disruptions.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.550
Then I guess I should also let
Min Ji Seop and Min Soo Jung know.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.150
After all, they both need to know.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.020
Well then...

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.870
There's going to be
a CEO appointment ceremony soon.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.440
Of course, it's not a permanent position,
just a temporary one.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.380
Is this the acting chairman's decision?

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.180
What, you think I'm just making this up?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.080
When is she making the appointment?

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.950
That's up to the person
holding all the cards.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.520
But it'll be in the next day or two.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.620
Any further delay will cause problems.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.620
So you're saying my fate will be decided
in the next day or two.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160
You could say that.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.600
Dear deity, Buddha, and ancestors,
please, help me.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.400
Please make sure I become CEO.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.570
Make me the CEO. Please...

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:13.040
I'm begging you, please...

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.610
So we'll know the result right away?

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.050
I'd imagine so.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.690
It seems like you're in a hurry
to get this done, Lawyer Kim.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.990
Why is that?

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.460
Kyung Chae isn't even part of the company,

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.930
so wouldn't it be better for her
if this appointment was delayed?

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.430
The position must be filled quickly.
We can't leave it vacant indefinitely.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.900
Let's just say it's a decision
for the greater good of the company.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.440
A decision for the "greater good."

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.070
All right.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.180
Tell the acting chairman that I'll support
whatever she decides.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:03.890
Goodness...

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.800
For my Se Ri's sake,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.300
Min Kyung Chae has to become
the head of Mingang,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.710
which means I have to get her
reinstated as CEO this time.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.010
But then that puts
Lucia's position in jeopardy.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.520
Does this mean they're fated
for a showdown?

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.450
Who is the one...

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.650
I need to help to survive,
and who needs to be forced out?

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.200
Hello?

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.300
Is this Stella's phone?

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.600
Of course it is, Pan Sool.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.200
Yes. This is Oh Pan Sool.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.440
Have you been well and happy?

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.670
Of course! Couldn't be better.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.180
So, what's this about?

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.680
Well...

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.920
Today, I'm going to entrust
my everything to you, Stella.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.820
I'm giving you all my shares in Mingang.
Do whatever you want with them.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.560
That is an excellent idea.
Should we meet right now?

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.490
At the same cafe as last time.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.260
Yes. I'll get there faster
than Usain Bolt can run.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.470
Okay.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.570
Who were you on the phone with?
Your cheeks are all flushed.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.440
What about my cheeks?

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.380
If I had no wrinkles,
the world would've gone crazy.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.740
Anyway, it was just a business call.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.210
- So stop talking nonsense.
- Don't lie. It wasn't a client.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.780
What are you plotting now?
Who are you meeting that needs an excuse?

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.790
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've heard.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.790
Your jealousy is pathological. Get it?

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.720
I know I'm so handsome, charming,
and charismatic that it's risky to go out,

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.930
but you make yourself look cheap
when you act like this.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.560
Handsome, charming, charismatic?
They must've frozen to death last year.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.630
I was worried you were meeting some bimbo
to waste time spouting nonsense.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.000
This meeting is productive, so not a word.
You'll get jinxed.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:58.010
Not only is my life on the line here,
but your life is riding on it too.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.750
Stella, is something wrong?

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.980
You don't look as well
as you did last time we met.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:06.650
Do I?

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.990
Maybe I'm just lovesick from missing you.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.920
Because you missed me?

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.360
Why would you miss
a plain old guy like me?

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.160
What are you talking about?

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.870
If I look closely at you,

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.640
I can see such exotic features.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.740
Exotic?

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.340
You mean like some kind of
European heartthrob?

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.710
You didn't know?

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.880
You're an unexpected charmer.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.380
An unexpected charmer?

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.050
What's that?

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.620
It means...

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.520
you're more charming the more I see you.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.460
Stella.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.460
You're my goddess.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.500
The goddess who's captured my heart.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.530
And on that note...

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600
Here.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.070
And this is?

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.810
My full stake in Mingang Distribution.
I brought every single share I own.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.480
It's all yours, Stella.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.750
So you're entrusting all of this...

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.690
to me?

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.490
Yes, all of it.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.820
Sell it all off before it tanks.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.360
Then pick a hot new stock,

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.030
and then make it pop,
just like popcorn! Boom!

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.960
And from now on,

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.500
it's cappuccino time.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.250
Is it on its way?

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.780
You're coming in, right?

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:53.690
Knock, knock!

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.860
- What are you staring at?
- It's nothing, sir.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.100
But what brings you here this late?

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.340
I did something drastic today,
and I felt you should be the one to know.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.200
What did you do?

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.170
I took my entire stake in Mingang...

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.180
and handed it all over to Ms. Stella.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.750
You gave her all of it?

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.650
Yes. I trust her with everything.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.690
Goodness. What are you doing in here?

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.520
I said not to bother him so he could rest.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.790
You're the one being a nuisance!
Now get out!

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.660
- Goodness, you get out.
- No, you get out first!

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.930
- Hey, you go first.
- No, you... Fine, let's play for it.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.060
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.630
- Get out!
- I won! Why should I have to leave?

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.030
- The winner leaves!
- You leave!

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.070
- I said to get out first!
- You leave.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.100
You, step out for one minute!

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.400
- Go on, get out!
- Leave!

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.640
- I said, get out!
- Go on, step out!

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.140
- Get out.
- Get out.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.140
- Come on! Out!
- Gosh, I'm burning up in here.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.310
Seriously...

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:54.990
It's me.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.420
Yes. Is something wrong? It's late.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.590
I just heard some news from Oh Pan Sool.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.930
Apparently, all the Mingang Distribution
shares he owns...

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.000
have been handed over to Madam Jang.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.230
Did she not tell you?

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.300
No.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.300
This is the first time I'm hearing it.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.700
That's strange.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.270
She would've told you right away.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:18.440
Yes, that is strange.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.610
I'll call her and find out.
See you at the office tomorrow.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.820
Hi, it's me.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.420
I just wanted to ask,

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.560
did Oh Pan Sool hand over
his stake to you today?

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.630
Tae Kyung just told me.
It seems he heard it directly from him.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.930
That old man, Oh Pan Sool,
just can't keep his mouth shut.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.170
I was going to tell you later.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.010
That's great news.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.540
So how big is our stake now?

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.780
Well that's not clear yet.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.810
Compared to them,
it's still just a drop in the bucket.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.150
Still, it's better than nothing.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.220
It's all thanks to you.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.990
Just like how you got your hands
on Se Ri's stake.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.290
I suppose I did.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.630
I guess I did skim some of Se Ri's shares.
Now that you mention it.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.700
By the way, can we meet
at the office tomorrow?

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.470
I'll come to you.
There's something I need to say.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.200
All right. See you tomorrow.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.310
Lucia.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.040
You and I...

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.380
are in such a cruel twist of fate.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.550
So if your stepmother
just gives you the nod,

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.760
you'll instantly be the CEO
of Mingang Distribution, right?

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.360
Exactly.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.430
I have a good feeling about it this time.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.460
I'm a better choice than
Soo Jung, obviously.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.230
Honestly, she's just as much of a brat
as Kyung Chae.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:53.470
Kyung Chae is in a league of her own,
but Soo Jung is a real piece of work, too.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.570
You're right. Sometimes I think
Soo Jung is even worse.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.240
That's what I'm saying.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.950
My stepmother can't stand her either.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.450
You know what they say,
a woman's worst enemy is another woman.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.220
Soo Jung had a fit trying
to stop Stepmother from moving in.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.520
It disgusted even me,

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:10.890
so can you imagine how she must have felt?

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.530
There's definitely still
some bad blood there.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.560
I really hope she asks you to be the CEO.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.400
As long as nothing crazy happens,
it's a shoo-in for me.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.370
Didn't you say you really laid it on thick
at the restaurant and department store?

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.800
Laid it on thick? Please.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.340
All that sucking up and catering to her.
You have no idea how hard I worked.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.510
Then we're golden.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.110
It's 100 percent going to be me.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.680
Is the era of CEO Min Ji Seop
about to begin?

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:47.090
She knows better than anyone that
Kyung Chae and I are like oil and water,

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.730
and since I even offered
to give her my stake last time,

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.500
the CEO should be a given, right?

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.700
Besides, can she really keep Kyung Chae
in check without my help?

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.470
Even though she's been kicked out
of the company for now,

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.840
she's not the type to take it lying down.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.250
Looks like they'll be having
sweet dreams tonight.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.450
Both Ji Seop and Soo Jung are counting
their chickens before they've hatched.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.760
When you make your comeback as CEO,
what's the first thing you want to do?

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.390
If I could,

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.260
I'd like to rewrite the Articles
of Incorporation my father created.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.500
So that some incompetent legitimate heir
or a wicked illegitimate child...

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.640
can never even dream of
owning Mingang Distribution.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.710
And I'll ensure the chairman's trophy wife
can never set foot in the company.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.910
I will create a perfect kingdom
with me, Min Kyung Chae, as its ruler.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.850
That's a nice thought,

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.020
but it doesn't sound like
there's a place for me in it.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.390
Right.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.150
I have to save a spot for you, Lawyer Kim.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:53.890
Don't you worry.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.890
Do you think I'd betray you?

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.630
No, I know you wouldn't,

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.800
but still, I'm not one
to be trifled with, either.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.270
Right.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.840
You're not an easy opponent.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.410
On that note, shall we have a toast?

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.250
Kim Sun Jae, you're just my tool.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.190
One I use when I need you,
and get rid of when I don't.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:33.630
(Client 1, Min Se Ri,
and Client 2, Stella Jang,)

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.430
(do not have
a grandparent–grandchild relationship.)

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.870
But this time, I'm going to save you.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.580
I'll carry your secret with me,
whatever it may be.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.350
Because that's how I survive, too.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.990
It's me. I need you to forge a document.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.930
It's urgent.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.460
Don't use an amateur.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.800
Get a professional,

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.530
and forge it so perfectly
that no one will ever notice.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.940
Scheme all you want,

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.540
but you're nothing without me.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.080
(Mingang Distribution)

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.430
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:40.560
Welcome.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.370
I hope I'm not interrupting.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:45.700
Not at all.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.540
I came because there was
something urgent I needed to say.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.340
I just felt this couldn't wait.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.780
I'm glad you came.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:55.280
Is it something important?

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.120
It looks like you're heading
somewhere important.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.390
- I am.
- Where to?

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.760
To take back my kingdom.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.110
My little good luck charm.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.010
I'll be back.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.520
What's with her?

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.390
Manager Gong, what's gotten into her?

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.460
Right.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:44.060
So, how are things
between you and Se Ri these days?

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.370
Se Ri? Why the sudden question?

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.900
Just curious.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.100
To be honest, whatever you end up doing...

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.610
to get revenge on Min Kyung Chae
and Min Doo Sik,

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.440
I don't really care.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.850
But when it comes to Se Ri,
I'm a little curious.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.350
How are you going to handle her?

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.260
I believe I've told you this before.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.090
You said you'd punish her.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.500
Right, but I mean,
besides just punishing her,

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.230
be more specific.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.700
Well...

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.040
What you say is extremely important.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.640
Because I'm dead serious right now.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.480
What do you mean by that?

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.960
Come on in.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.860
This is who I'm recommending
for the CEO position.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.530
Say hello.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.200
Hello.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.470
I'm Min Kyung Chae. I'm here
on Jang Yeon Sook's recommendation.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:09.850
She's perfect for the CEO position
at Mingang Distribution, don't you agree?

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.290
Madam Jang, why are you doing this?

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.760
What in the world is going on?

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.130
Madam Jang, how could you do this to me?

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.400
What's the problem?

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.740
She's part of
Mingang Distribution's owner family.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.470
She has the skills and the resume...

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.770
to be the perfect fit, right?

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.810
Madam Jang!

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.510
Could you give us a minute?

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.750
Of course.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.690
After all we did to get rid of her,
you're bringing her back?

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.230
And as the CEO!

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:58.260
Why not?
Is it such a disaster if she comes back?

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.160
Why are you doing this, Madam Jang?

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.500
Because no one is as capable as her.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.100
Or would you prefer
I appoint Min Soo Jung?

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.470
What about Min Ji Seop?

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.240
No, I can't let that happen.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.880
If Min Kyung Chae returns,
she'll stop at nothing to get me fired.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.850
After everything I've been through
to get here!

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.820
Sit down.

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:23.020
Sit down!

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.720
Jung Lucia.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:27.360
Listen to me.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.740
Am I...

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.670
misunderstanding something?

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.510
Why do I feel like you've changed
all of a sudden?

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.410
I haven't changed.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.250
The circumstances have.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.880
What do you mean? What's changed?

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.420
It would take all day to explain.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.020
Anyway...

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.930
Just make Min Kyung Chae the CEO.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.790
And that's that.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.770
No, I can't do that.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.530
That would put us back at square one.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.100
Then what have we been fighting for?

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.140
"We?" Who said you and I are a "we?"

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.280
Excuse me?

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:25.680
What makes you think you and I are a "we?"

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:33.590
What has gotten into you?

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.430
As of today, Min Kyung Chae is
the CEO of Mingang Distribution again.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.000
And if you so much as lay a finger
on CEO Min without my permission,

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:53.810
I'll expose you for who you really are,
Baek Sul Hee.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.200
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.840
You know what the most satisfying part is?

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.780
Watching Lucia get stabbed in the back
by the one she trusted most.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.980
What's that supposed to mean?

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.390
Someone will be coming
as the CEO tomorrow?

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.420
There was no other choice.
We're going our separate ways.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:38.720
But what if Lucia gets hurt?

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:39.860
Why am I here?

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.120
Where am I?

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.230
How interesting.
But when should I expose that...

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.130
Min Se Ri isn't
Madam Jang's granddaughter?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
