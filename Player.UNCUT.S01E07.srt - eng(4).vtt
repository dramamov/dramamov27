00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.920
- (Previously on "Player")
- I also want to know about your first kiss.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.000
11th grade, in a science classroom.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.360
Fresh orange juice for my gorgeous athlete.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.360
Ploy, don’t be so cold, please.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.000
Prang and I have a shoot coming up in Pattaya.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.080
If it were me,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.600
I wouldn’t be thrilled about
a proposal like that.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.280
Are you here with your friends, Ploy?

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.800
What a coincidence!

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.240
You’re still waiting for me, aren’t you?
That’s why you’re still single.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.880
Have you ever felt jealous

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.240
when I talk to someone else?

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.160
You belong only to me, Pun.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.720
“Feels like a dream.”

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.200
“A good dream, right?”

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.560
“A very good one.”

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.080
What are you sketching?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.520
Oh, just doodling.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.800
Where’s the one of me, then?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.840
Umm.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.000
Do you want it in full Romanticism style, Ploy?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.960
Or maybe like what you saw last night?

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.240
You’re going for a swim, right?
Have you put on sunscreen yet?

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.200
I have.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.880
Want to swim with me?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.280
Sure.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.920
♫ You act so calm and cool
as you’re stepping close to me ♫

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.600
♫ You come around so endlessly,
I know what’s on your mind, you see ♫

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.120
♫ You play it off each time our eyes collide ♫

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.000
♫ But your gaze betrays the truth you try to hide ♫

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.320
♫ The closer we become ♫

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.480
♫ The more my heart’s undone ♫

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.480
♫ It trembles more each time we meet as one ♫

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.079
♫ Game for your love ♫

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.760
♫ But I’m a pro player, baby ♫

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.880
♫ I wish you’d slip and show your heart to me ♫

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.200
♫ But somehow, I can always see it clearly ♫

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:41.480
♫ I try so hard to hold my heart inside
But in the end, I can’t stop loving you so right ♫

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.960
♫ Game Over ♫

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.240
Having fun?

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.079
What do you mean, Ploy?

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.080
I mean the trip.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.000
What were you thinking?

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.800
Well…

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.120
It’s been fun.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.000
Why so tense?

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.520
I was just asking.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.440
Pun!

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.280
Oh! Ploy.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.600
Have you packed yet? We’re about to leave.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.920
All done, Prang.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.600
You can wait in the car.
I just need to finish my makeup.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.960
Right?

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.080
Makeup?

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.600
Huh?

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.880
Yes.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.480
I just thought
I’d like my makeup to match Pun’s.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.480
So I was going to ask her to do it for me.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.720
Right?

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.880
Y–y–yeah.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.920
Okay then.

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.280
Alright then.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.280
I’ll wait in the car.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.600
Sure.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.800
Need a bit more?

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.800
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.960
- Need…
- Need just the lips.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.920
Just a touch more lipstick.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.040
Okay.

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.880
- We’ll be right there.
- Okay.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.040
Ploy.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.200
What?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.960
Why did you answer Prang like that?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.600
Put some lipstick on me.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.240
Why do you like teasing me so much?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.440
I don’t.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.960
You totally do.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.560
Fine, I’ll stop teasing you then.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.200
What’s wrong, Prang?
You’ve looked tense all day.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.680
I’m starting to think

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.760
there’s definitely something

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.400
going on between Pun and Ploy.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.760
Again?

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.800
Stop stressing over it.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.760
When two people love each other,
no one else can change that.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.720
Just like us.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.840
("The Deviana")

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.480
What are you thinking about?

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.560
Hmm?

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.960
I was just deciding what to drink.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.200
You need to think about that?

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.080
Well…

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.520
I want coffee,

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.560
but it’s already noon.
I might not sleep later.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.840
As for the orange juice,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.200
I’d rather save that for you.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.920
And the water's just too plain.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.440
Tell me when you’ve decided.
I’ve got to get to work.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.520
You’re heading to work already?

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.320
Can’t you stay?

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.520
I’ll miss you too much.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.760
I’ll be back soon.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.360
Mhm.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.640
Okay.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.880
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.160
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.960
Who told you to drink coffee, Pun?

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:54.920
Pun.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.160
Let’s go eat.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.080
Hey!

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.480
You alright?

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.680
Want some paracetamol?

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.680
I just didn’t sleep much.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.640
I’m totally fine.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.120
Oh,

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.680
Are you sure about that?

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.280
I’m fine.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.480
Totally fine.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.040
Okay.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.800
I think I’ll go get the doctor.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.680
(yawns)

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.440
(Ploy: “Let me know when you get off work.”)

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.240
Ploy.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.920
Pay a bit of attention to me, please.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.440
Let me just finish this scene first.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.840
But I miss you so much.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.360
What?

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.320
Come help me run lines instead.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.400
Please?

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.360
Please?

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.600
Please?

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.920
Okay, fine.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.040
But...

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.640
When we’re done rehearsing,

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.040
you have to do what I ask, alright?

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.760
Chatr, my love…

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.200
Ahem.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.800
What is it, Jinny?

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.200
Ahem…

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.920
Can’t you stay here with me?

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.640
Why do you have to go with her?

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.320
I really have to go, Jinny.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.760
What if I don’t let you?

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.760
I’d still have to go, Jinny.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.360
Aren’t you supposed to
push me away in this scene?

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.320
Then I won’t go anywhere, Jinny.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.280
You look perfect. No more makeup needed.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:24.800
That’s enough.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.920
Careful.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:28.840
Hmm?

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.360
I almost got that on you.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.800
I wouldn’t have minded,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.200
so my face would smell nice.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.760
Think we should even it out?

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.280
Perfect.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.960
You’ve got so many perfumes, Ploy.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.520
Well. Every day feels a little different. Doesn’t it?

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.840
I’ve always wondered

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.360
why you like perfumes so much.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.280
No special reason, really.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.720
That’s it?

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.000
I think so.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.080
Then why do you love art?

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.720
- Well…
- Hmm?

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.040
I don’t know either.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.760
See?

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.800
But I once heard

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.560
that there’s always a reason
why we love something.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.680
It’s just that sometimes, we forget it

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.040
or can’t quite think of it.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.280
I’m heading out, Ploy.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.880
If I had to think about it,

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.880
I’d say scent is such a dimensional sense.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.840
Ever notice how, when you spray perfume,

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.880
you start to see colors
or images in your mind?

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.760
Or just feel something?

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.760
I have.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.040
Even now.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.440
That’s it.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.320
When I spray perfume,
I see a faint aura.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.040
Like a colored barrier.
Each one’s different.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.120
So are the feelings they bring.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.280
Some make me feel fresh,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.080
stronger,

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.360
more confident.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.000
But overall,

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.600
It makes me feel safe.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.360
That’s lovely.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.560
Have you ever done a perfume workshop before?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.600
I’ve studied a bit, but never tried making one.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.040
So what made you bring me here?

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.840
I saw it on a friend’s Insta.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.240
Made me think of you.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.400
We get to make our own perfume today.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.520
You’ll love it.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.240
I don’t know.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.800
I usually stick to branded ones.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.960
But this bottle will be one of a kind.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.240
No brand could ever top that.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.120
Let’s do it.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.440
Come on.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.000
Lead the way.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.040
Where should we sit?

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.520
Here?

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.640
Hello.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:12.960
Thank you.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.720
Here, let me help you.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.920
Give me your arms.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.240
Like this?

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.520
- Uh-huh.
- Alright.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.040
Now, if you want to make it more personal,

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.640
you can mix in another scent.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.840
Let’s give it a try.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.920
This one’s better.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.480
You’re frowning so hard.
Your brows are about to tie in a bow.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.280
Here.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.520
Don’t overthink it.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.080
Just follow your heart.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.920
Let me smell that.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.760
Hmm…

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.640
Almost perfect.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.040
Doesn’t smell good?

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.520
A little.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:37.960
Only a little?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.360
Then make it better.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.160
I’ll show you.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.920
What’s this?

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.920
- (”Tiger Cub”)
- Tiger Cub.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.400
The club? Where tigers go to play?

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.080
I picked a scent that suits you.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.520
You love pretending to be a tiger,

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.040
but you still purr like a cub.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.840
You’re underestimating me.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.520
Even cubs can bite.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.320
And I’ve already caught my prey.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.720
So I’m the prey now?

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.040
The tastiest kind.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.360
Here. This one’s yours.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.480
I didn’t make it to match you,

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.640
(”Pun’s hug”)

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.320
since you already have plenty

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.560
of perfumes you love.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.440
But when you wear this one,

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.080
you’ll think of me.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.480
The other day,

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.600
You said your perfume makes you feel safe,

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.440
like you’re wrapped in a barrier, right?

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.760
But with this one,

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.520
you won’t feel a barrier.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.200
You’ll see my aura instead,

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.520
hugging you tight.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.240
That’s a million times safer.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.360
Thank you.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.800
("The Deviana")

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.800
Put your hands here.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.680
- Here?
- Yes, just under that.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.400
Mm.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.480
Pull slowly…

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.400
Whoa!

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.200
- Heavy?
- Yeah, a bit heavier than I thought.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.880
You’re staring that hard.
Why don’t you just go ask them?

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.520
Wouldn’t matter. They wouldn’t answer.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.760
Prang, can’t you just stop overthinking this?

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:34.160
I can’t. I don’t want to see my own sister crying again,
especially not over my ex.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.280
- You’re doing great.
- Ploy’s not exactly harmless.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.440
She played you too, remember?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.120
I know.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.120
But the way she looks at Pun is
not the same as how she looked at us.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.880
Still, I can’t help worrying.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.200
You worry too much.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.720
Look!

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.160
It’s nothing, just a normal workout.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.800
That’s normal. How do you want them to do it?

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.320
They’re a bit too close though.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.320
How’s she supposed to help if she stays far away?

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.520
See?

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.600
Nothing’s going on. Stop worrying.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.120
Did you have fun today?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.400
Did you?

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.080
When will you stop answering my questions
with another question?

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.120
If you had fun, then I did too.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.000
Hello, Jae Ang.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.280
This time, I really want the plan to work.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.800
It’s okay. Let’s keep it simple this time.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.520
Just the two of us working together.
No need to go all out.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.120
I just want the proposal to finally happen.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.160
At this point, I’ll be happy just to ask her.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.400
Thanks a lot, Jae Ang.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.560
Is Jay really going to propose to Prang?

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.360
Seeing them so in love makes me happy.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.720
Still, I didn’t think it’d happen this soon.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.320
When you’re sure about someone,
there’s no such thing as too soon.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.120
What about Jay, though?
Finally done flirting around?

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.000
What? Don’t you trust her?

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.720
It’s not that.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.440
I just didn’t see it coming. That’s all.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.920
Anyway…

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.680
Let’s leave their love story to them.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.440
We’ve got our own story to focus on.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.600
Why’s that?

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.640
You want to get married too, Ploy?

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.160
Who knows about the future.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.320
I want to focus on now.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.000
(phone ringing)

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.840
(phone ringing)

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.120
(phone ringing)

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.320
You're gonna answer that?

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.200
I’ll be right back.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.840
- What’s the matter, Krit?
- "Where are you right now?"

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.840
Just about to sleep.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.880
Get here quick.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.720
We just ran into Phetai.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.920
We’re watching him now.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.040
What? Seriously?

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.400
Best just sent you the location. Hurry!

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.720
Okay, okay.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.960
“What should I do?”

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.880
This might be your only chance
to get that million back, Pun.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.680
Are you really gonna walk away from Ploy for that?

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.400
What are you even going to tell her?

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.520
Just tell her you’ve got something to take care of.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.800
She’ll understand. She always does.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.840
And what if she doesn’t?

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.480
You’ll just end up fighting with her for nothing, Pun.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.120
Ugh! You overthink everything.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.480
Come on. Think about it.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.360
If you get that million back,

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.400
you and Ploy could finally live comfortably.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.560
No more stress. No more debts hanging over you.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:04.960
Pun.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.000
Is something wrong?

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.280
I…

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.800
It’s just...

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.280
Something urgent came up. I have to go.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.760
Right now?

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.640
Yeah.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.520
I’m sorry.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.640
I’ll handle it myself.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.080
Pun! Pun!

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.040
Where is he?

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.040
Bathroom. Just came out a minute ago.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.920
- Over there?
- Yeah.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.800
But before he left,
I saw him talking to that woman over there.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.440
Right before he walked out.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.960
Bet he’s after money again, as always.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.120
He came in, handed something over,
chatted a bit, then left.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.400
So I told Krit to keep an eye on him,

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.000
while I watched the front.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.720
Smart move, girl.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.160
Of course.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.880
Hey. Where’s Jieab?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.560
No idea. Haven’t seen her in a while.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.480
Ugh, forget about her.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.320
You stay here. I’ll go check it out.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.440
(groans, cries)

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.360
Oh no! Krit!

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.520
What happened to you?

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.360
Look!

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.400
Damn it.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.040
I’m sorry. He caught on.
Then, bang!

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.480
Damn. Let’s get you to a doctor.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.040
Forget about Phetai.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.760
You alright?

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.280
I’m fine. Just dizzy.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:10.960
Ow…

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.239
He acted like he didn’t notice me.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.639
But the second I looked away,
he whacked me with his helmet.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.440
Come on.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.199
You should’ve known

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:25.960
anyone walking into a bar carrying a helmet

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.199
can’t be trusted.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.480
Yeah.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.639
Right. Hospital first.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.520
Hey, are you sure you can walk?

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.159
(screams)

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.280
What the hell is this?

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:40.920
What did he do to you?

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.120
- Look!
- Whoa!

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.400
He hit him with a helmet when he was unguarded

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.880
Damn. Did he get away?

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.560
Maybe worry about my head first?

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:52.719
Oh, Chakrit.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.639
That head of yours, only I’m allowed to hit it!

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.040
- What?
- Why weren’t you paying attention?

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.480
Actually,

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.280
On my way in,

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.120
I passed a guy in a helmet.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.760
- What color was he wearing?
- Black.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.800
Riding a Triumph, right?

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.440
Yeah.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.080
(cries)

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.680
Damn it! I tailed him all the way
from that late-night rice porridge place.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.600
Can’t believe he got away

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.440
and nailed Krit, too.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.120
Take him to a hospital?

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.800
- Go, go.
- Yeah. Fine. Let’s go.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.560
Come on.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.000
(phone ringing)

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.400
Oh! Ploy.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.560
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.280
Shh!

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.120
Yes, Ploy?

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.440
Are you back home yet?

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.640
Yeah. Just got here.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.760
Are you heading to bed?

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.440
Mhm.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.520
Okay. I’m in my room too.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.520
So… Will you take me to see a doctor?

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.520
Should we go?

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.200
- Yeah, yeah, we’re going.
- Yeah.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.440
("The Deviana")

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.360
(”Tiger Cub”)

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.360
(Pun: “Good morning, Ploy.”
“Are you awake yet?”)

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.600
(”No answer”)

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.320
Hi, Ji.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.920
Do you know where Ploy’s headed today?

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.000
“Hmm, she’s shooting a show till noon.”

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.240
“Why, something up?”

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.240
What about afternoon?

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.000
“In the afternoon, Ploy’s having a meal
with the producers.”

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.880
“She won’t be free until late afternoon.”

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.400
Thanks, Ji.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.720
Table for how many?

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.640
Oh, I’m just here to drop something off…

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.040
- “Yeah, yeah.”
- “Pretty good, right?”

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.120
“We can rest right here.”

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.920
“Yeah, that works.”

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.680
Um, can I help you with something?

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.400
Oh. I just need to make a quick call.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.680
Of course.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.600
(phone ringing)

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.160
“This one should be for that scene, right?”

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.440
Yes.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.520
Well, Ploy?

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.800
Ji told me you were having lunch
at Min’s restaurant.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.280
Mind if I drop something off there?

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.200
Ploy?

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.440
I’m not there anymore.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.680
I’m back on set.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.840
- Everything okay, Ploy?
- Mm-hmm.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.680
That’s so lovely.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.560
- “This one’s cute, right?”
- “It’s cute.”

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.160
(Pun: Let me know when you’re home.)

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.600
(phone ringing)

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:54.960
Yeah?

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.800
Ploy.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.920
When will you be free next?

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.320
I won’t.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.120
“Hey. Jay and Prang,”

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.040
Have you spoken to Ploy lately?

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.240
Not really.

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.400
I guess she’s been busy lately.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.160
Why do you ask?

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.120
Oh, nothing.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.320
I just…

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.000
haven’t seen her much these days.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:08.880
Prang.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.240
Do you know anything about Dream?

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.200
What about her?

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.800
You know, about her and Ploy.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.440
Well…

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.560
I was just wondering.
They seem pretty close.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.600
They were each other’s first love.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.280
Didn’t end too well, though.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.560
But they’ve managed to stay friends.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.840
“Friends, huh?”

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.560
“At least one of them
doesn’t seem to want to be just that.”

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.400
Why are you so curious, anyway?

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.680
I’m just Thai. Curiosity’s in my DNA.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.720
I’m asking on behalf of the whole country.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.680
Just being nosy.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.960
Still,

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.520
I think Dream’s trying to rekindle an old flame.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.480
But it’s hard to tell what’s going on in Ploy’s head.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.600
Sometimes she acts like she doesn’t care,

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.040
but then she’s out and about with her.

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.640
It’s like when I was flirting with Ploy.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.160
She didn’t mind talking to me.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.760
But she never said yes, either.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:26.040
Babe, that’s ancient history.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.640
It doesn’t mean anything now.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.520
Come on. Let’s eat.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.440
Here. Crispy pork. My favorite.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.280
Stop.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.000
Enough crispy pork for now.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.160
Eat some veggies for once.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:40.920
Get some fibre in you.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.320
Then I’ll take yours. Deal?

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.680
No.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.280
Hello, Ji.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.800
Hi there.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.880
Is Ploy on set today?

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.840
I brought her some snacks.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.400
Ploy’s not shooting today.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.080
She only comes in twice a week.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.160
Oh, okay.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.880
Thanks, Ji.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.880
They really don't take care of you, huh?

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.240
It’s fine.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.240
Better than being stuck reshooting all day.

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.560
Didn’t Ji say she wasn’t coming in?

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:49.720
Guess she lied.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.160
Not showing up on camera, though.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.960
Oh. Poor you.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.960
Oh! Pun.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.400
What are you doing here?

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.440
I brought some snacks for Jay,

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.200
and figured I’d drop these off
for you, too, Ploy.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.200
Thank you.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.800
Are you free for a minute?

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.160
We need to talk.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.360
Sure.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.080
Dream, I’ll be right back.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:29.600
Okay.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.160
- Could you please give these to Jay for me?
- Of course.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.320
You’ve been working a lot, huh?

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.520
You don’t look like you’ve had much rest.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.760
I’ve been shooting every day, hardly any sleep.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.760
Want me to pick you up later, then?

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.120
I’ll be finishing late.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.240
You’ve got work in the morning.
I don’t want you waiting up.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.040
Okay.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.440
Then, take care of yourself, alright?

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.000
I will.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.000
(phone ringing)

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480
“Ploy?”

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:01.280
Will you be back for dinner?
I already cooked.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.960
Don’t worry about it.
I’m still working.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.680
Ploy?

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.400
“I’m Busy.”

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:02.880
Ploy?

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.840
“I’m Busy.”

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.160
Ploy?

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.880
“I’m Busy.”

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.200
Ploy?

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.320
“I’m Busy.”

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.960
(door bell ringing)

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.560
(door bell ringing)

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.600
(door bell ringing)

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:48.920
Ploy?

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.160
Easy there.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.240
Sit down first.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.240
Have you been drinking?

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.600
Do I look like I have?

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.680
You look tipsy.

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.080
Tipsy?

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.880
Mhm. So how did you get home?

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.320
Min dropped me off.

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.160
Then let me take off your shoes.

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.440
Why?

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.280
Don’t you like them?

00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.960
I do, but they still need to come off.

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.960
Will you take my clothes off too?

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.440
I missed you, Pun.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.320
Say it again.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.760
I missed you, Pun.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.160
If you missed me,
why didn’t you come?

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.360
Where have you been all these days?

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.200
Can you hold me?

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.520
Where did you go, Ploy?

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.040
Who did this?

00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.160
Was it Dream?

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:37.000
Answer me, Ploy.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.880
Are there more?

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.640
Just that one.

00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.600
I’m going to take a shower.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.520
Ploy.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.360
Don’t go yet.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:33.960
Talk to me first.

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.560
I won’t ask
why you let someone do that to you.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.600
But I will say that

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.600
I don’t like seeing someone else’s mark
on your neck.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.880
And when you talk to other people,

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.440
do you ever care about how I feel?

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.920
Are you mad at me, Ploy?

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:05.960
I’m running late. I have to go to work.

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.480
Ploy…

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.160
I’m sorry

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.440
for last night.

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:23.920
Hello?

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:25.800
Hello, Ji.

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.560
Where’s Ploy working today?

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.040
Just an evening party.

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.200
No drama shoot, right?

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.960
No, not today.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.160
Thanks, Ji.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.240
Now you know, so let go of me.

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.760
If you’re not shooting,
what are you doing on set?

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:04.160
I’ve never questioned where you go,

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:07.720
or what you’re really doing.

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.000
I’m sorry.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.160
I won’t do it again.

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.640
And about talking to someone else,

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.960
there’s been no one else for a long time, Ploy.

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:37.200
You haven’t come to see me at all.
Is it because you’re angry with me?

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.560
If you are,

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:43.000
then at least show it.
Let me know somehow.

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.760
I’m not angry, Pun.

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.280
I’m just hurt.

00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.360
I thought maybe you’d found someone else.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.920
So you’d rather see me be hurt
than see me with someone else?

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.280
Being hurt means you still care.

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.040
Having someone else means you don’t.

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.680
I have to get to work.

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.960
Can you stay with me?

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.800
I’ve missed you.

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:21.440
There’s a long weekend coming up.

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.640
Come to Hong Kong with me.

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:29.280
I’ll go!

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.200
Anywhere you ask, I’ll go.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.360
Ploy.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.320
What do you want to eat in Hong Kong?

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.680
Anything’s fine.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:13.880
Hmm.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.960
I’ve already saved so many reviews.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.760
(phone ringing)

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.720
Oh, wait a sec.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.360
Hello?

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.040
“Hello? Pun, right?”

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.520
Yes.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.120
Who's this?

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.360
“Don’t you recognize my voice?”

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.160
“Your soon-to-be husband, of course.”

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:47.960
Phetai?

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.600
- (Next episode)
- I don’t care what you’ve done.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.920
Do you really think I live like this,
hiding all the time

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:58.800
for no reason?

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.400
Prang, stop trying to fix things for me.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.520
You think you can sort it all yourself?

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.680
Ploy, please tell me I’m wrong about this.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.720
How could you do this to me?

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.680
What about you?

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.280
Are you keeping something from me?

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:13.440
How easy is it for someone to
give up on a relationship?

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.360
