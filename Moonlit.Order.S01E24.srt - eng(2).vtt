Welcome back.

I won't let you suffer
any more hardships.

00:03:08.932 --> 00:03:10.412
Come home with me.

00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:13.333

00:03:20.412 --> 00:03:21.373
I'll double it.

00:03:21.772 --> 00:03:22.492

I'll triple it.

You're getting executed this autumn.

00:03:42.132 --> 00:03:43.613
Still acting all high and mighty?

00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:47.173

Qianfu.

Grand Tutor.

00:03:57.253 --> 00:03:58.373
I knew you'd come.

00:03:58.533 --> 00:03:59.373
You've suffered.

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:00.772
I'm sure you know

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:03.333
what I did at the court was just an act.

00:04:03.652 --> 00:04:04.253
You've always

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:05.733
treated me like your own

00:04:05.852 --> 00:04:06.453
over the years.

00:04:06.652 --> 00:04:07.692
How could I betray you?

00:04:08.412 --> 00:04:10.333
I've devised an escape plan.

00:04:10.652 --> 00:04:11.333
Unfortunately,

00:04:11.572 --> 00:04:13.013
we two can't manage alone.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:15.733
I need some money to pay off

00:04:16.213 --> 00:04:17.173
the guards.

00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:19.213
Makes sense.

00:04:20.812 --> 00:04:21.653
That's easy.

00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:35.132
Here's 3,000 liang.

00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:39.372
I know it's not much.

00:04:49.653 --> 00:04:51.692
Here's the key to my treasury,

00:04:52.252 --> 00:04:54.213
which is more loaded
than the national treasury.

00:04:55.013 --> 00:04:55.653
Take it.

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:56.933
Bribe whoever you need.

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:02.852
Qianfu.

00:05:03.412 --> 00:05:04.333
Don't just

00:05:04.852 --> 00:05:06.132
rely on bribes.

00:05:07.453 --> 00:05:09.213
Learn seduction tactics.

00:05:10.972 --> 00:05:11.493
What?

00:05:13.173 --> 00:05:13.972
Seduction.

00:05:15.252 --> 00:05:15.692
What?

00:05:16.292 --> 00:05:16.812
Seduction.

00:05:17.613 --> 00:05:18.173
Seduction?

00:05:28.744 --> 00:05:29.972
(List)

00:05:29.972 --> 00:05:32.453
Here are all my concubines'
portraits and deeds.

00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:34.292
Take it all.

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:35.933
Use them as needed.

00:05:40.412 --> 00:05:40.893
Got it.

00:05:51.372 --> 00:05:52.092
Grand Tutor.

00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:54.653
What is it, Qianfu?

00:05:56.453 --> 00:05:57.773
Call me by my full name.

00:05:58.933 --> 00:06:00.092
Gu Qianfu.

00:06:00.692 --> 00:06:01.453
Fine, Gu Qianfu.

00:06:01.812 --> 00:06:02.613
What's wrong?

00:06:05.653 --> 00:06:06.572
Don't you

00:06:07.532 --> 00:06:10.213
owe me 3,000 liang pension?

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.490
What do you mean?

00:06:23.493 --> 00:06:24.252
Qianfu.

00:06:24.773 --> 00:06:26.773
You should've told me to step aside.

00:06:27.213 --> 00:06:28.333
Now that the door is open,

00:06:28.812 --> 00:06:29.893
just get me out.

00:06:39.893 --> 00:06:40.733
Let's go, Qianfu.

00:06:43.532 --> 00:06:44.292
What now, Qianfu?

00:06:47.692 --> 00:06:48.773
What are you doing, Qianfu?

00:06:53.812 --> 00:06:54.773
What am I doing?

00:06:55.653 --> 00:06:57.053
Repaying debts

00:06:57.092 --> 00:06:59.092
- Qianfu.
- is only right.

00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:01.013
Murder and arson.

00:07:01.532 --> 00:07:02.773
- Flipping truths to lies.
- What's wrong?

00:07:03.252 --> 00:07:04.493
Committing every vice.

00:07:05.053 --> 00:07:06.613
- You deserve this.
- Stop.

00:07:09.213 --> 00:07:09.893
We always pay

00:07:10.812 --> 00:07:11.733
for what we've done.

00:07:15.692 --> 00:07:17.493
Qianfu.

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:19.453
Oh, right.

00:07:20.453 --> 00:07:21.213
Nobody has used

00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:22.733
so many idioms nonstop, huh?

00:07:23.412 --> 00:07:24.613
I'm an educated man.

00:07:29.773 --> 00:07:31.252
How was my acting, Mr. Gu?

00:07:31.592 --> 00:07:32.488
Almost matched mine.

00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:35.213
Transfer illicit funds
to the national treasury.

00:07:35.773 --> 00:07:37.692
Release his innocent family members.

00:07:38.053 --> 00:07:38.453
Yes.

00:07:40.613 --> 00:07:41.213
Grand Tutor.

00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:42.933
Take care.

Gu Qianfu. Mr. Gu.

00:07:46.252 --> 00:07:47.972
My hero. My warrior.

00:07:48.132 --> 00:07:49.572
Spare me.

00:07:50.613 --> 00:07:53.132
A life spent groveling in the dirt.

00:07:54.893 --> 00:08:00.333
And it all comes to dust.

00:08:14.972 --> 00:08:16.933
We went through some disturbances.

00:08:17.493 --> 00:08:19.013
Thanks to Miss Feng,

00:08:19.613 --> 00:08:20.333
Mr. Gu,

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:22.053
my brother Jia Xun,

00:08:22.532 --> 00:08:24.053
and all esteemed ministers,

00:08:25.412 --> 00:08:28.933
the disturbances have now been quelled.

00:08:29.812 --> 00:08:31.933
So he's the real Prince Jia Xun.

00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:33.013
That's right.

00:08:33.572 --> 00:08:36.333
My long-lost brother Jia Xun

00:08:36.773 --> 00:08:37.453
has returned.

00:08:38.052 --> 00:08:40.853
I hereby appoint Jia Xun
as Grand Mentor to the Crown Prince

00:08:41.213 --> 00:08:42.293
and Regent

00:08:42.572 --> 00:08:44.533
to guide the Crown Prince's education.

00:08:47.773 --> 00:08:48.893
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:08:49.172 --> 00:08:49.853
My gratitude.

00:08:52.492 --> 00:08:54.413
Miss Feng protected me

00:08:54.692 --> 00:08:58.453
and shall be promoted to Commander
of the Imperial Guard.

00:08:59.732 --> 00:09:01.453
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:09:03.213 --> 00:09:05.213
Mr. Gu saved me

00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:07.572
and shall be promoted
to Chief of the Jing'an Bureau

00:09:07.932 --> 00:09:09.213

00:09:12.612 --> 00:09:14.533
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:19.132
The rest of you shall receive
three years' extra wage.

00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:21.893
May you all fulfill
your duties diligently

00:09:22.333 --> 00:09:25.653
and restore integrity
to the imperial court.

00:09:26.372 --> 00:09:29.973
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

00:09:35.172 --> 00:09:35.812
Jia Xun.

00:09:36.653 --> 00:09:37.973
Now, shouldn't you

00:09:38.533 --> 00:09:40.093
address me as Brother?

00:09:41.453 --> 00:09:41.973
Brother.

00:09:50.093 --> 00:09:50.533
Brother.

00:09:51.093 --> 00:09:53.213
Can I make a request?

00:10:01.773 --> 00:10:04.172
Men should prioritize their careers.

00:10:05.013 --> 00:10:06.853
Your foremost duty now

00:10:07.093 --> 00:10:09.492
is to guide the Crown Prince.

00:10:11.013 --> 00:10:12.333
Other matters

00:10:13.372 --> 00:10:15.973
will be arranged in due time.

00:10:20.172 --> 00:10:20.893

00:10:22.572 --> 00:10:23.812

artisans, and merchants.

People don't see

00:10:45.932 --> 00:10:47.492
that harnessing capital properly

00:10:47.773 --> 00:10:49.093
can boost agriculture

00:10:49.293 --> 00:10:50.812
and strengthen the nation.

00:10:51.013 --> 00:10:52.052
Grand Mentor,

00:10:52.492 --> 00:10:54.612
how would breaking the boundaries

00:10:54.973 --> 00:10:58.052
between these professions
benefit our nation?

00:10:59.132 --> 00:10:59.653
Well...

00:10:59.773 --> 00:11:03.773
Which current predicaments
could be resolved?

00:11:05.413 --> 00:11:06.413
How much money could it

00:11:06.692 --> 00:11:08.252
offer to the national treasury

00:11:08.492 --> 00:11:09.853
every year?

00:11:12.013 --> 00:11:13.213
Money-wise...

00:11:13.533 --> 00:11:14.172
It's fine.

00:11:14.773 --> 00:11:16.692
You may ponder this carefully.

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:17.612
It happens

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:18.812
that you haven't

00:11:19.052 --> 00:11:21.612
handed in your memorials
to Father, right?

00:11:22.773 --> 00:11:25.692
I find this proposal excellent.

00:11:26.172 --> 00:11:28.293
Your vision surpasses ordinary men.

00:11:28.893 --> 00:11:29.932
It's truly remarkable.

00:11:31.013 --> 00:11:32.013

00:12:45.973 --> 00:12:46.893
Yeah, exactly.

00:12:48.453 --> 00:12:49.293

Hold them together.

00:12:51.572 --> 00:12:53.052
Just hold it like this.

Hold it steady.

00:12:57.213 --> 00:12:57.533

00:12:57.653 --> 00:12:58.013
Okay.

00:12:58.093 --> 00:12:58.492
Look.

00:12:58.533 --> 00:12:59.372
Fold it in half.

00:12:59.692 --> 00:13:01.132
- Pinch here.
- Fold.

00:13:01.692 --> 00:13:02.413

Jiaoqian?

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.732
She went to get the leek filling.

00:13:14.172 --> 00:13:15.612
Father, look.

00:13:15.812 --> 00:13:16.773
Did I wrap this well?

00:13:18.773 --> 00:13:19.252
Not bad.

00:13:21.492 --> 00:13:22.132

00:13:22.853 --> 00:13:24.572
Make sure it's sealed tightly.

Feng Zuoren is quite remarkable.

00:14:21.692 --> 00:14:23.093
She's skilled in martial arts,

00:14:23.413 --> 00:14:24.492

Am I not older than you?

00:14:33.413 --> 00:14:34.853
We need to clarify this.

00:14:35.172 --> 00:14:36.093
Who is older?

00:14:36.533 --> 00:14:38.853
I'm the elder. You're the kid here.

00:14:40.172 --> 00:14:41.372
Why aren't you the kid?

00:14:41.612 --> 00:14:42.333
Why am I the kid?

00:14:42.533 --> 00:14:43.492
No way.

00:14:43.653 --> 00:14:44.252
Forget it.

00:14:44.453 --> 00:14:44.732

00:14:45.773 --> 00:14:46.492
Yes, you can.

00:14:46.653 --> 00:14:47.492
I can't.

00:14:47.533 --> 00:14:48.692
You're knowledgeable.

00:14:49.252 --> 00:14:50.213

So decreed.

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.692
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:15:43.013 --> 00:15:45.052
But I have one more request

00:15:45.732 --> 00:15:46.572
to make.

00:15:51.413 --> 00:15:53.252
Men should prioritize their careers.

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:55.413
For now, focus on the reform

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:56.692
of the social classes.

00:15:56.853 --> 00:15:58.692

will be arranged in due time.

- We thank Your Majesty.
- We thank Your Majesty.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.252
That sounds familiar.

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:15.372
It's been a million years.

00:16:16.413 --> 00:16:17.572
When will you finally

00:16:17.653 --> 00:16:19.172
let me marry Feng Zuoren?

00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:24.172
Like father, like son.

00:16:26.213 --> 00:16:27.812
(They say the same thing.)

00:16:28.653 --> 00:16:29.653
(I can't keep)

00:16:30.052 --> 00:16:31.492
(waiting passively forever.)

00:16:39.453 --> 00:16:40.052

But I do.
