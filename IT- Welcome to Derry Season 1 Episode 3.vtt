WEBVTT

00:19.728 --> 00:22.022
Step right up, folks!

00:22.522 --> 00:26.776
Step right up and see our hall
of freaks and curiosities!

00:27.277 --> 00:31.489
The Lee Twins, joined at birth
by a cruel trick of God!

00:33.450 --> 00:34.492
Careful.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.120
And the dog-faced boy,

00:37.662 --> 00:39.289
more dog than boy.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.499
The Skeleton Man,

00:42.917 --> 00:44.878
more dead than alive.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.547
Slorak, the Man-Ape,

00:48.590 --> 00:51.217
more ape than man.

00:51.926 --> 00:55.472
Come on. They're all here.

01:05.565 --> 01:06.816
Step right up...

01:07.817 --> 01:12.781
into a grotesquerie of horrors
beyond your darkest imaginings.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.742
Step right up.

01:25.710 --> 01:26.711
There you go.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.676
Step right up.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.971
Step right up.

01:54.864 --> 01:55.949
Keep moving.

03:04.642 --> 03:05.977
Hello, boy.

03:07.604 --> 03:08.855
Come closer.

03:14.027 --> 03:17.488
Don't be afraid. Come closer.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.872
Come on. Come closer.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.376
Yeah. That's right.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.553
Now you see it!

03:50.647 --> 03:51.814
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:52.941 --> 03:53.983
There you are.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.695
For the love of Christ.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.949
Don't be a damn sissy, Francis.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.576
Your old man won you something.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.378
Come on.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.843
-Step right up.
-Thank you.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.120
Come on.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.123
God.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.800
Damn fair cleaned me out.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.760
Get us some water.

05:18.192 --> 05:19.319
One please.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.699
Come on now, hurry up.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.578
It's five cents.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.290
That's all I got.

05:33.832 --> 05:35.168
That a slingshot?

05:57.273 --> 05:58.691
Where's that damn slingshot?

06:27.595 --> 06:31.599
Wait! Francis! No! Come back! Wait!

06:33.101 --> 06:35.436
Francis! Come back!

07:12.932 --> 07:14.058
What do you want?

07:23.359 --> 07:24.610
Leave me alone!

07:40.084 --> 07:41.085
Hello.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.173
Run, come on!

08:32.220 --> 08:33.221
Hurry.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.265
He's getting closer!

08:36.765 --> 08:37.975
Don't look back!

10:39.639 --> 10:41.557
Look at the logjam.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.776
Yippee!

10:53.319 --> 10:54.570
Mrs. Bainbridge.

10:55.738 --> 10:56.906
Pleasure to see you again.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.868
I've upped Lilly's dosage
of chlorpromazine,

11:00.951 --> 11:03.079
but if she has another episode,

11:03.162 --> 11:06.791
we may want to discuss a more
restrictive treatment plan.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.542
Where is she now?

11:08.626 --> 11:12.463
Lilly forged quite the bond last summer
with the head of our housekeeping staff.

11:12.546 --> 11:14.382
She wanted to say goodbye
before she left.

11:14.882 --> 11:17.385
Fold and tuck.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.436
It's going to be okay, dear.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.898
You're a bright girl.
You'll figure it out.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.234
Yeah, it's just...

11:34.694 --> 11:37.238
It's my fault that her dad's in jail.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.408
We don't even know each other that well.

11:41.033 --> 11:44.036
And if I tell the truth
about what I really saw, then--

11:44.120 --> 11:46.247
You'd probably wind up right back here.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.459
What would you do if you were me?

11:54.088 --> 11:56.924
My father used to say that life
is about the journey.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.761
But I think it's more about
who you take that journey with.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.764
And if this Ronnie means as much
to you as it sounds,

12:04.932 --> 12:07.101
you're going to find a way
to make things right.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.187
Somehow.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.151
Listen.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.320
If you tell me that
you've seen the impossible...

12:19.905 --> 12:21.073
then I believe you.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.910
Most people, well...

12:26.746 --> 12:28.748
they only believe what they can see...

12:33.169 --> 12:34.712
with their own eyes.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.561
Easy, partner.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.273
I come in peace.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.051
What's the matter, not your brand?

13:22.134 --> 13:24.094
I'm more of an Embassy Golds man.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.681
Is that right? Embassy Golds.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.059
Not too popular this side of the pond.

13:31.560 --> 13:35.231
To think, I had you pegged
as a Pall Mall man,

13:35.731 --> 13:37.358
a regular James Coburn.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.401
Lee Marvin.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.530
Pall Malls,
the commercials are Lee Marvin.

13:44.031 --> 13:47.701
Well, you do know your movie stars, Hank.
Guess it comes with the territory, huh?

13:49.078 --> 13:52.289
You know what I know,
what my... my territory is?

13:55.334 --> 13:56.335
Liars.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.755
I can sniff 'em out a mile away.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.136
Where were you
the night of the murder, Hank?

14:06.220 --> 14:07.888
I told you, I was home.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.684
Then why do I have an eyewitness,
puts you on Jackson Street at 11:30?

14:15.855 --> 14:18.649
Yeah, a witness called it in,
said she saw your picture in the papers.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.067
Put two and two together with the man

14:20.150 --> 14:22.403
she'd seen sneaking around
in the shadows that night.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.530
-She wrote a sworn statement.
-Yeah, it don't make it true.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.198
Well, she was pretty upset.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.785
So, we went out there,
had a look around, and...

14:32.830 --> 14:34.373
found this at the scene.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.670
"Thou shalt not lie," Hank.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.925
Do you know what they do
to kiddy-killers in Shawshank?

14:45.467 --> 14:47.344
I didn't do nothing to those kids,

14:47.469 --> 14:49.388
and I wasn't nowhere near that theater.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.472
Then where were you, Hank?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.808
And don't give me any more guff
about you being at home in bed.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.476
Don't insult my intelligence.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.403
All right.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.077
We're gonna miss you around here, Hank.

15:13.537 --> 15:14.747
At least we got the memories.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.832
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait. wait.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.752
I... I didn't do this! I didn't do this!

15:20.377 --> 15:22.796
Come back! Come back!

16:11.220 --> 16:14.473
Can you imagine if your dad
turns out to be a psycho killer?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.894
I mean, they must have evidence
if they arrested him, right?

16:19.353 --> 16:22.231
This is America. You can't just
throw people in jail for nothing.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.775
Are we talking about the same country?

16:27.319 --> 16:29.029
She just doesn't seem
like the kind of person

16:29.113 --> 16:30.531
that would've been raised by a killer.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.366
That's all.

16:38.455 --> 16:39.456
Hey.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.669
Grabbed this from the nurse's office.
It should help get that off.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.046
You're the last person I need help from.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.966
You're lucky I don't whoop your ass
for what you did to my dad.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.885
You just walk on out of here.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.264
-Just go.
-I'll tell them, okay?

16:55.889 --> 16:57.558
What I really saw.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.478
-You will?
-I'll do anything to make it right.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.315
It happened again at the grocery store.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.108
I saw my dad.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.946
They sent me back to Juniper Hill.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.575
Now everyone thinks I'm still crazy or,

17:14.657 --> 17:17.828
I don't know, even more crazy.
So even if I tell them the truth,

17:17.911 --> 17:19.454
no one's gonna believe it.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.042
People only believe what
they can see for themselves.

17:25.794 --> 17:28.756
It won't matter what we tell them
unless we can show them proof.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.675
How are we supposed to get proof?

17:35.763 --> 17:37.681
You actually think this thing
is gonna stop

17:37.765 --> 17:39.224
and pose for pictures?

17:39.308 --> 17:41.685
What have we got to lose?
It's worth a shot.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.855
To prove that I'm not crazy
and that your dad's not a killer.

17:48.692 --> 17:49.693
Okay.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.363
Say we try this
and we actually get something.

17:53.781 --> 17:54.823
What are we gonna do?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.742
Send it to Keene's to get developed?

17:57.034 --> 17:58.827
We'd never get those pictures back.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.830
And I don't know how
to develop a roll of film.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.707
-Do you?
-No.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.752
But there must be someone
we know who can.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.134
We stripped that Caddy down to the bolts.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.513
If there was anything hidden inside,
we'd have found it. It's clean.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.891
Nothing but blood stains and bullet holes.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.393
We even checked the area
around the dig site.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.896
Must have dug up half an acre.
Still no luck.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.898
Of course not.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.943
What we're looking for
was buried in Derry 300 years

18:31.026 --> 18:32.861
before the automobile was even invented.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.407
But that car had to give off something
for Hallorann to be able to find it.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.327
It's part of the 1935 cycle.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.121
The Bradley Gang massacre.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.248
Bunch of Dillinger wannabes.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.375
Town went crazy and shot them to hell.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.212
Eyewitness reports at the time
suggest sightings of the entity

18:50.254 --> 18:52.548
in one of its forms.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.347
Everything we've dug up so far

19:00.430 --> 19:02.182
and we're no closer
to locating the target.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.101
And we're running out of time.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.145
Hallorann's psychic abilities
have been proven,

19:06.228 --> 19:09.148
but there's only so much he can do
stuck on base pointing at maps.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.110
We need to get him closer to the target.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.446
Right on top of it if possible.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.407
On top of it, sir?

19:23.287 --> 19:24.580
Put him in the air.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.790
Hallorann is the key
to this whole operation.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.208
If something should happen to him--

19:28.292 --> 19:29.918
We have Major Hanlon
to look after him now.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.211
Well, with all due respect, sir,

19:31.295 --> 19:33.463
how do we know Hallorann will do
any better out in the field?

19:33.547 --> 19:35.924
Maybe he just needs
a little something extra to guide him.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.605
Something that put its mark on that thing

19:50.480 --> 19:51.607
a long time ago.

20:01.783 --> 20:02.868
Ain't no way.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.620
-Bullshit. Bullshit.
-Ain't no way.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.496
There ain't no way. Ain't no way.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.582
You ain't never made it
with Aretha Franklin.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.125
Hand to God!

20:10.209 --> 20:12.336
We met in Detroit. At a club.

20:12.794 --> 20:16.548
Spent the night together. Shit,
she even wrote a song about me.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.593
Yeah, "Won't Be Long."

20:27.392 --> 20:29.061
Goddamn, man.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.104
Fuck!

20:32.689 --> 20:35.317
I thought you were supposed
to have special privileges.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.194
So, what?

20:37.277 --> 20:39.905
So, can't you get us a little upgrade?

20:39.988 --> 20:42.199
Hallorann. It's time.

20:49.164 --> 20:50.457
We want that upgrade.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.921
Masters, son of a bitch.
I'd love to get him

20:56.004 --> 20:57.339
and his buddies alone, let me tell you.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.924
It's too bad,
because Masters and his pals

20:59.007 --> 21:01.843
-shipped off yesterday, so it's done.
-Yeah, tell that to my right shoulder.

21:02.844 --> 21:03.971
You gotta man up, Pauly.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.222
-"Man up"?
-Yeah.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.057
I was taking those two guys down
while you were still

21:07.140 --> 21:09.184
under the bed looking
for your jaw. "Man up."

21:09.268 --> 21:10.894
I don't remember you taking anyone down.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.813
I remember you were getting tossed around
like a baby.

21:12.896 --> 21:13.897
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

21:14.022 --> 21:15.023
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.775
Then why are you
in the military? Why'd you join?

21:16.858 --> 21:18.902
-I look so good in the uniform.
-Yeah?

21:18.986 --> 21:20.445
-No, not the hair. Not the hair.
-Fuck you.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.155
Touch that, you die. You know that.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.952
-Major.
-Colonel.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.954
Airman Hallorann, this is Major Hanlon,

21:29.037 --> 21:31.999
Captain Russo. They'll be your crew
for today's surveillance flight.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.250
How they hangin', fellas?

21:36.336 --> 21:39.047
Sir, what exactly are we
gonna be surveilling this afternoon?

21:39.131 --> 21:40.173
Your consoles.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.302
Think of Hallorann here
as a human compass.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.970
You go wherever he says to.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.684
-Sounds good.
-Let's get you in the air.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.787
-So, Hallorann.
-Yeah?

22:11.997 --> 22:13.290
What's with the cigars?

22:15.042 --> 22:16.251
No cigars in here.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.587
Well, then what's in it?

22:22.466 --> 22:23.717
You wouldn't understand.

22:54.831 --> 22:57.626
You're-- You're gonna need to turn east.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.837
East. Now!

23:03.340 --> 23:05.509
Roger that. East we go.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.742
Why-- Why are you stopping?
We have to get out of here.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.786
We're okay now. Look.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.038
It doesn't leave the woods.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.583
What was that thing?

23:39.251 --> 23:40.710
I don't know.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.671
Stop, please.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.258
Why can't it leave the woods?

23:51.179 --> 23:52.639
Can you keep a secret?

23:59.938 --> 24:02.482
I don't know what they think
they're doing out there.

24:03.692 --> 24:07.404
Our ceremonial grounds
have always been off limits.

24:07.529 --> 24:10.115
-If they want the land--
-They always want the land.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.075
Then at least give us a fair price

24:12.159 --> 24:14.744
so that we can fix things up
around the Marsh.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.956
She's right.
We're, what, an hour outside of Derry?

24:18.206 --> 24:20.292
We might as well be on different planets.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.086
The tax money they got
to pave their streets.

24:23.753 --> 24:24.754
The car they dug up?

24:24.838 --> 24:26.798
This isn't about airing
long-standing grievances...

24:26.882 --> 24:28.341
It was Al Bradley's.

24:29.759 --> 24:30.802
From '35.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.846
The massacre.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.724
If you're going
to represent our interests...

24:35.974 --> 24:37.559
We have to do something
now, Auntie.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.227
-Before they get any closer--
-No.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.812
And so do they.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.815
You and your friends
are not to get involved.

24:44.649 --> 24:45.901
Not in this.

24:47.944 --> 24:49.070
You're needed.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.281
Do you understand?

24:51.364 --> 24:55.118
This is about you doing
what you were elected to do.

24:55.243 --> 24:57.662
If anyone has any suggestions,
they should speak up now.

24:58.038 --> 25:01.041
John, something has to be done. Now.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.751
I've requested to meet,

25:02.834 --> 25:06.046
asking for a special liaison
to the community.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.798
We've heard nothing,
so what do you suggest?

25:09.424 --> 25:10.592
Something stronger.

25:11.551 --> 25:14.179
We start with a cease-and-desist letter.

25:14.262 --> 25:16.806
-That's bullshit.
-Give them some time to respond,

25:16.890 --> 25:19.559
and if we still hear nothing,
we file a formal complaint

25:19.643 --> 25:20.936
through the federal government.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.854
You know they'll just ignore it.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.314
You want to stop them?

25:24.981 --> 25:26.024
I don't.

25:27.275 --> 25:28.652
Not until I find out

25:28.735 --> 25:31.321
what it is they're actually
doing out there.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.597
Hey, Hallorann, you all right back there?

25:59.516 --> 26:00.684
Hallorann!

26:02.561 --> 26:03.812
The hell's he doing?

26:03.895 --> 26:05.313
You think I know
what's going on with him?

26:08.650 --> 26:09.651
Hallorann!

26:12.153 --> 26:14.531
"Human compass"? Look at this fucking guy.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.867
Look like a human compass to you?
He's having a goddamn fit.

26:20.662 --> 26:21.788
Jesus Christ.

26:21.871 --> 26:24.874
Ground, this is USAF-KC135.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.502
I got a buddy at Fort Bragg,
he was saying that they're doing, like,

26:27.794 --> 26:29.879
mind control on goats or some shit.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.882
Is that what this is?
Is this some goat shit, Lee?

26:33.008 --> 26:35.802
There appears to be something wrong
with Hallorann. Unresponsive.

26:35.885 --> 26:38.930
-Requesting permission to head back.
-That's a negative, Major Hanlon.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.809
-Maintain present course.
-I'm advising again. Unresponsive.

26:44.644 --> 26:46.563
Requesting permission to head back.

26:49.649 --> 26:52.402
I'm advising that Airman Hallorann
is unresponsive!

26:52.485 --> 26:53.862
Requesting permission to head back!

26:54.404 --> 26:55.405
Hallorann!

26:56.239 --> 26:59.451
Hey! Hallorann!

28:15.777 --> 28:19.364
Who are you?

29:05.368 --> 29:06.369
Grandma.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.997
He's coming, Dickie.

29:09.497 --> 29:12.542
Get out of here. Now!

29:27.265 --> 29:29.809
Hallorann! Step back, Hallorann!

29:33.772 --> 29:35.398
-Hallorann! Hallorann!
-No! No!

29:35.482 --> 29:37.984
-Hey! Hey!
-You both in?

30:09.641 --> 30:12.560
-How you holding up, soldier?
-I feel fine, sir.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.439
So...

30:17.649 --> 30:18.650
you saw it.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.322
More like it saw me.

30:27.242 --> 30:28.451
What was it like?

30:31.079 --> 30:32.080
Cold.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.296
You did good up there today.

30:42.841 --> 30:43.925
If there's anything

30:44.008 --> 30:46.302
we can do to make
your time here a little easier,

30:46.427 --> 30:47.554
you let me know.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.975
-Now that you mention it...
-That was quick.

30:54.185 --> 30:58.815
Me and my pals on base, it's kind of hard
to find a place to blow off steam.

30:59.148 --> 31:01.734
If you can see fit
to find us someplace that

31:02.068 --> 31:05.989
maybe it don't rain in on our heads,
I know the boys would be grateful.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.784
Understood. I'll see what I can do.

31:12.328 --> 31:13.329
Sir.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.880
It wasn't supposed to see us.

31:24.299 --> 31:25.717
It wasn't supposed to know.

31:29.679 --> 31:30.847
I got a feeling

31:30.930 --> 31:33.433
we keep on like we're doing,
something bad is coming.

31:36.686 --> 31:38.855
Maybe we oughta just let this thing be.

31:47.989 --> 31:49.240
Rest up.

32:05.673 --> 32:07.258
Here you go, gentlemen.

32:09.427 --> 32:10.887
The trip was supposed
to be short,

32:10.970 --> 32:12.847
but the launch was delayed
for over three hours

32:12.931 --> 32:14.724
after Shepard climbed into the rocket.

32:14.849 --> 32:16.684
So Shepard asked
if he could go outside and pee,

32:16.768 --> 32:18.436
and they said no,
but they had to temporarily

32:18.519 --> 32:19.938
turn off the electrical parts in his suit

32:20.021 --> 32:21.773
so he could pee in his pants
without frying himself.

32:21.856 --> 32:24.776
So, you're telling me the first human

32:24.859 --> 32:27.278
that went to space went there
with pee in his pants?

32:27.362 --> 32:28.404
Yeah.

32:28.655 --> 32:30.073
It could have been worse.

32:30.239 --> 32:31.491
Dude, stop!

32:32.325 --> 32:33.785
You got it on your face.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.203
Let me ask you this.

32:36.162 --> 32:38.206
Who do you think has
the best ta-tas in the grade?

32:38.665 --> 32:39.707
What?

32:39.791 --> 32:41.334
Do they not call them ta-tas
where you're from?

32:41.417 --> 32:44.754
-No, they do.
-Well, for me, it's Delores.

32:46.422 --> 32:49.467
Even though Marge Truman
has the better face.

32:59.018 --> 33:00.103
Ronnie Grogan?

33:00.770 --> 33:02.230
What does she want with you?

33:07.610 --> 33:09.445
-Can I what?
-Develop film.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.073
I mean, the way you talked
about that stink bomb,

33:12.156 --> 33:13.700
thought maybe you knew
what type of chemicals

33:13.783 --> 33:14.909
you needed in a dark room.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.786
Can't you just send it out
to a lab?

33:16.869 --> 33:19.247
No. Can you help us or not?

33:19.497 --> 33:20.790
Maybe, but why?

33:22.333 --> 33:24.252
You wouldn't believe us if we told you.

33:25.545 --> 33:26.587
Try me.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.258
So, what do you think?

33:31.050 --> 33:32.301
Why did I agree to this?

33:32.552 --> 33:33.594
I can't help her.

33:33.886 --> 33:35.304
Well, do you believe her?

33:35.763 --> 33:37.265
I believe she believes it.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.643
But when she asked me,
it's like my mind just went blank.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.521
-Love will do that to you.
-Yeah.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.191
-Wait, what?
-Ronnie. You're sweet on her.

33:47.316 --> 33:49.318
-I know the signs.
-There are no signs.

33:49.402 --> 33:50.528
Sure there are.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.781
Love can make you do
some crazy things, pal.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.200
Like climb a balcony or-- or...

33:57.660 --> 33:59.328
Or write a poem
on the inside of your shoe

33:59.412 --> 34:00.705
so no one finds out about it.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.124
Who writes poems on the inside
of their shoes?

34:03.332 --> 34:04.542
Just someone.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.587
Someone in love.

34:08.795 --> 34:10.715
Okay, but I'm not in love with Ronnie.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.842
Whatever you say, Romeo.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.397
Let me know if you need any help.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.319
You looking for anything special today?

34:32.235 --> 34:33.571
Well, I don't know.

34:36.783 --> 34:38.117
What do you have for a nickel?

34:44.123 --> 34:47.085
-Francis Shaw.
-Has it really been 50 years?

34:48.628 --> 34:49.754
Doesn't seem possible.

34:50.838 --> 34:52.715
No, it doesn't.

34:53.716 --> 34:55.134
It's the oddest thing.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.514
Before I got here, I...
I didn't remember you at all.

35:00.431 --> 35:03.392
-You really know how to flatter a gal.
-I mean, I didn't remember any of it.

35:04.310 --> 35:07.146
-You. This town.
-You're not the first.

35:08.022 --> 35:09.440
Derry's funny that way.

35:10.566 --> 35:13.778
No matter how long you spend here,
the further away you get,

35:14.654 --> 35:17.448
the more it all just seems to fade.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.994
Some would say it's for the best.

35:22.703 --> 35:23.704
I don't know.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.541
It has its charms.

35:29.627 --> 35:30.795
What do you remember?

35:31.921 --> 35:33.172
Not much.

35:33.256 --> 35:37.635
My father, life on the base,
but mostly I remember you.

35:39.303 --> 35:42.014
It was one summer, Francis. We were 12.

35:42.431 --> 35:44.934
I doubt you even remembered my name.

35:48.729 --> 35:49.772
I didn't.

35:54.193 --> 35:55.528
Not until this week.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.575
You're in charge of the digs?

36:04.704 --> 36:06.330
What are you doing out there, Francis?

36:06.914 --> 36:07.957
Soil surveys.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.459
We're trying to figure out
where to lay pipe

36:10.543 --> 36:11.878
to bring in water from the Kenduskeag.

36:12.253 --> 36:14.046
And our community is concerned

36:14.130 --> 36:16.883
that your dig
will disturb sacred remains.

36:17.008 --> 36:20.636
We can't allow unmarked burial grounds
to be destroyed.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.888
Then let's work together.

36:22.805 --> 36:25.683
You can show us exactly
what areas to stay away from.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.523
I know it might not mean much
coming from a man in my position,

36:33.608 --> 36:34.984
but you can trust me.

36:37.403 --> 36:38.863
I'd like to believe that.

36:41.949 --> 36:43.993
I will talk to the town council.

36:45.411 --> 36:46.871
No promises.

36:47.496 --> 36:48.581
I'll be in touch.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.923
It's nice to see you, Rose.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.426
You too.

37:28.829 --> 37:31.332
What's the matter?
Why do you look so sad?

37:33.709 --> 37:35.586
My dad got his redeployment orders.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.588
We leave in the morning.

37:42.927 --> 37:45.137
I was gonna wait
to give this back to you, but...

37:46.305 --> 37:48.891
I think you should have it.
Something to remember me by.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.316
You have to promise me something, okay?

37:58.150 --> 38:01.404
Promise me you'll never
forget me, this summer,

38:01.988 --> 38:04.740
us being friends.

38:07.910 --> 38:10.538
Francis, you don't know this yet, but...

38:11.497 --> 38:13.624
this place has a way
of making people forget,

38:14.917 --> 38:16.502
even if they don't want to.

38:44.238 --> 38:47.658
Holy smokes! This place
is the living end, man!

38:48.701 --> 38:50.369
How do you even know about it?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.872
It's my friends' place. Their hangout.

38:53.956 --> 38:55.916
Or it was.

38:57.001 --> 39:00.254
No way! I love these!

39:01.630 --> 39:03.215
So, how do we get this picture?

39:04.216 --> 39:05.885
Well, I guess we could either wait for it

39:05.968 --> 39:10.056
to come after us again or...
I don't know, somehow draw it out?

39:10.931 --> 39:13.434
What are all the ways this thing
has come after you so far?

39:13.517 --> 39:15.311
Matty, my dad.

39:15.978 --> 39:19.273
-Ronnie's mom.
-Yeah, but it's not them.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.693
It's something pretending to be them,
to scare us.

39:23.277 --> 39:25.821
The right question would be,
what in the hell is it?

39:25.905 --> 39:27.531
-It's an orixá.
-What?

39:27.615 --> 39:29.450
You know, an evil spirit.

39:30.159 --> 39:32.703
Well, they're not all evil,
but this one sounds pretty bad.

39:33.245 --> 39:34.663
How do you know?

39:35.831 --> 39:39.752
Well, I don't know for sure,
but my tío was a babalao.

39:41.253 --> 39:44.173
Back in Cuba, a Santería priest.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.759
He told me whenever
someone welched on him,

39:46.842 --> 39:48.719
you know,
didn't pay back money and stuff,

39:49.637 --> 39:52.390
he'd conjure this orixá
and send it after them.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.935
And the really mean ones

39:56.560 --> 39:59.230
always took the form
of their dead ancestors.

40:00.106 --> 40:01.816
You know, to really freak them out.

40:03.484 --> 40:06.362
And he was able to just conjure them?

40:06.445 --> 40:10.032
Yeah, but he had to go
to a cemetery, light candles.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.118
It was a whole big thing.

40:13.327 --> 40:14.412
Crazy, right?

40:18.833 --> 40:21.127
Go! Go! Go!

40:23.796 --> 40:25.589
No! Stupid wind!

40:25.673 --> 40:26.715
Rich...

40:27.508 --> 40:29.927
Did he ever tell you how?

40:34.932 --> 40:36.225
Evening, ma'am.

40:36.767 --> 40:39.145
-Thank you. Come on in.
-Yes, ma'am.

40:40.479 --> 40:41.730
Major.

40:54.034 --> 40:56.787
-Don't sell yourself short.
-You put some Spanish saffron in this?

40:57.955 --> 41:01.083
Ain't much in the way of Cajun cuisine
in these parts, I'm afraid.

41:01.167 --> 41:04.503
Things are certainly different here,

41:04.628 --> 41:05.796
I'll give you that.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.133
We're getting into
the swing of it, though.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.218
Starting to feel like home.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.723
You don't like it much
down here, do you, Mrs. Hanlon?

41:16.599 --> 41:18.267
Oh, I like it fine.

41:22.730 --> 41:26.650
You know, it's hard not to miss
the things you leave behind.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.777
We don't need to get into all that.

41:29.945 --> 41:31.405
I was a history teacher.

41:32.031 --> 41:33.240
Colored school?

41:33.365 --> 41:35.117
There another kind down there
that'd let me teach?

41:36.285 --> 41:37.286
Fair enough.

41:38.537 --> 41:40.623
We tried to find something
at a school up here,

41:41.165 --> 41:43.959
but all they had was clerical work.
She's overqualified.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.295
There were other things.
Meetings, marches.

41:46.378 --> 41:48.714
-Please.
-The movement.

41:52.760 --> 41:54.845
The Major is worried my activism

41:54.929 --> 41:57.306
will reflect poorly
on him with his colleagues.

41:57.806 --> 42:00.809
Hamper his ascent
up the military food chain.

42:03.270 --> 42:05.940
I can see how that
could be a concern, ma'am.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.400
It's hard enough being colored
in the service.

42:08.484 --> 42:10.486
And you got any real ambition,
you gonna want

42:10.569 --> 42:13.030
your personal life
to be cleaner than your uniform.

42:14.782 --> 42:19.370
Well, I'm not surprised
y'all two flyboys stick together.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.874
Excuse me,
I'm gonna get dessert started.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.545
So, where's your son at tonight?

42:30.881 --> 42:31.882
Will?

42:34.009 --> 42:35.177
You'll meet him sometime.

42:35.970 --> 42:37.555
But he's at a friend's house now.

42:43.769 --> 42:44.979
This camera's boss.

42:45.062 --> 42:47.398
Oh, man. I've never seen
one of these before.

42:47.481 --> 42:48.649
Will.

42:50.025 --> 42:51.402
What's with the face?

42:51.902 --> 42:53.153
Nothing.

42:54.405 --> 42:55.447
Hey, Ronnie.

42:57.074 --> 42:58.242
Don't waste film.

42:58.325 --> 43:00.286
We need every picture we can get.

43:00.369 --> 43:02.371
-All right, sorry.
-Look okay?

43:03.080 --> 43:06.125
-We did everything like you said.
-Yeah, great. A-plus.

43:06.292 --> 43:07.334
Okay.

43:11.630 --> 43:14.842
-Should we start?
-Yeah, sure.

43:15.342 --> 43:17.428
Why not? Come on.

43:35.070 --> 43:36.155
Hell of a meal, Major.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.699
Your wife know her way around the kitchen.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.123
I never told you we had a son.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.461
Must have heard it from someone on base.

44:06.435 --> 44:07.561
What happened up there?

44:09.813 --> 44:11.231
I mean, closing your eyes

44:12.524 --> 44:13.651
to look for something.

44:15.444 --> 44:16.445
What is that?

44:21.116 --> 44:22.701
My grandmama said it's like...

44:23.661 --> 44:25.871
it's like seeing things
without seeing things.

44:26.747 --> 44:29.416
Yeah, I know. It sounds crazy, right?

44:29.917 --> 44:33.629
Place I grew up, everybody knew someone
who knew someone that was like that.

44:34.421 --> 44:36.173
I've just never seen it for myself.

44:40.386 --> 44:42.596
It's funny, just before,

44:43.305 --> 44:46.392
you asked me about my son,
I felt something.

44:48.977 --> 44:51.063
Yeah, somewhere in the back of my brain.

44:52.773 --> 44:55.150
Can't describe it really,
other than it's the strangest

44:55.234 --> 44:57.111
goddamn thing I've ever felt
in my whole life.

44:57.194 --> 44:58.737
And I've only felt it one other time.

45:02.408 --> 45:03.784
The night I was attacked...

45:05.494 --> 45:06.620
you were there.

45:11.083 --> 45:14.795
It wasn't you holding the pipe,
but I know what I felt.

45:17.923 --> 45:19.925
Stay out of my head. We clear?

45:21.260 --> 45:23.679
I will. I will.
You don't have to worry about that.

45:26.557 --> 45:27.766
What is that supposed to mean?

45:31.270 --> 45:33.814
I've seen what men think about
when they're facing death.

45:33.939 --> 45:36.525
They think about their families.
They think about their regrets.

45:38.193 --> 45:39.194
But you?

45:41.864 --> 45:44.324
Gun to your head, finger on the trigger.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.077
You were analyzing.

45:47.161 --> 45:48.203
You were just...

45:49.455 --> 45:50.622
collecting information.

45:52.374 --> 45:54.543
It's like the part of your brain
that's supposed to be afraid,

45:54.626 --> 45:55.753
it's not even there.

45:58.297 --> 45:59.423
So, you are not

45:59.923 --> 46:03.135
the kind of fella
I'm likely to fuck with, Major.

46:12.060 --> 46:13.979
But you saved my life up in that bird.

46:14.897 --> 46:17.483
So I sure wouldn't mind
having you with me in them trenches.

46:18.400 --> 46:19.610
All right.

46:19.693 --> 46:21.278
Who's ready for some dessert?

46:21.987 --> 46:23.697
Mud cake's just about done.

46:26.116 --> 46:28.285
-I would love some mud cake.
-All right.

46:29.203 --> 46:30.287
Come on, Lee.

46:51.725 --> 46:53.936
Rich, you're just repeating yourself.

46:54.019 --> 46:55.729
What is that? What are you saying?

46:56.980 --> 46:58.065
The Santa Maria?

46:58.649 --> 46:59.900
The prayer for the dead?

47:03.362 --> 47:04.571
Now we wait.

47:13.038 --> 47:16.792
Feels like we should be facing away
from each other to see out, right?

47:16.875 --> 47:18.460
Yeah, that's what my uncle said to do.

47:20.921 --> 47:22.756
Yeah. Yeah, good idea.

47:28.971 --> 47:30.097
Sorry.

47:58.709 --> 47:59.751
Gotta take a whiz.

48:00.294 --> 48:01.587
No. Wait, wait, I thought you said

48:01.670 --> 48:03.630
we couldn't leave
the circle until it was done.

48:04.339 --> 48:06.133
No, you can.
You just have to come back quickly.

48:06.216 --> 48:07.217
My cousin told me.

48:07.801 --> 48:09.344
You said your uncle did it.

48:11.471 --> 48:14.266
Well, yeah, but I mostly heard
about it from my cousin, so--

48:14.349 --> 48:15.767
You didn't hear it from him?

48:16.768 --> 48:18.312
Well, not the whole thing.

48:18.478 --> 48:20.689
-This is so messed up.
-Okay, we're leaving.

48:20.814 --> 48:22.983
Hold on, guys,
he was just trying to help.

48:23.066 --> 48:24.902
Making up all this mumbo jumbo?

48:24.985 --> 48:27.946
Come on. Monsters, ghosts,
it's all mumbo jumbo.

48:30.449 --> 48:31.658
So, you still don't believe me?

48:32.618 --> 48:34.411
You think it's just my imagination?

48:34.494 --> 48:36.538
I... I believe you believe it.

48:39.666 --> 48:41.418
I'm sorry, okay? I... I didn't...

48:42.252 --> 48:44.713
-Ro-- Ron!
-Wait, Ronnie!

48:58.560 --> 49:00.312
It's just hard making friends.

49:01.188 --> 49:04.107
-You know?
-I know, man. I know.

49:10.656 --> 49:11.698
You okay?

49:12.366 --> 49:13.575
I don't want to talk about it.

49:21.249 --> 49:23.210
Come on, Rich! We gotta catch up!

49:41.520 --> 49:42.646
Are you seeing this?

49:46.441 --> 49:47.776
Something's wrong, I think.

49:48.652 --> 49:52.155
Hey, Ron, slow down. Ron, wait up.

49:58.912 --> 49:59.913
Whoa!

50:00.706 --> 50:01.999
What's happening?

50:06.712 --> 50:07.838
Go, go, go!

50:13.010 --> 50:14.344
We're almost there!

50:27.315 --> 50:28.442
Tío?

50:35.699 --> 50:36.825
No, tío!

51:07.564 --> 51:08.690
What's happening?

51:13.779 --> 51:15.906
This can't be real. This can't be real.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.335
I got it! I got it!

51:29.544 --> 51:33.340
Oranges and lemons
Say the bells of St. Clement's

51:35.509 --> 51:37.052
Rich! Get the camera!

51:40.806 --> 51:41.848
I see it!

51:44.601 --> 51:45.977
I got it! I got it!

51:56.238 --> 51:57.280
Flashlight.

52:13.255 --> 52:14.256
Oh, shit!

52:15.423 --> 52:17.217
Oh, shit! Whoa!

52:18.426 --> 52:20.137
-Rich?
-Will, get the camera!

52:29.479 --> 52:31.273
Oh my God, what the hell was that?

52:32.816 --> 52:35.652
Where's Will?
Guys, guys! hey, guys, stop!

52:37.654 --> 52:39.656
Where's Will?
He was just right behind me.

53:54.481 --> 53:56.358
-Come on!
-Hurry!

53:58.652 --> 54:01.321
-Come on! Oh my God!
-Hurry, get out of there!

54:01.404 --> 54:02.489
Come on!

54:10.538 --> 54:13.166
-I should have believed you.
-You're damn right!

54:41.695 --> 54:42.779
Do you need help?

54:48.076 --> 54:50.578
Shit, I think I just broke
both my femurs.

54:55.667 --> 54:58.169
Okay, so first we're going
to set up three trays

54:58.253 --> 54:59.629
and a water bath.

54:59.754 --> 55:02.590
-Fill one tray with developer.
-Smells like Fizz-A-Lot.

55:02.674 --> 55:03.842
-Can you drink these?
-No.

55:03.967 --> 55:07.262
One with mixer
and the other with stop bath.

55:07.345 --> 55:08.763
Rich, don't touch that.

55:11.224 --> 55:12.517
Red light.

55:14.477 --> 55:15.520
Timer.

55:18.064 --> 55:20.025
And now we wait.

55:38.335 --> 55:39.627
Holy shit.

55:40.170 --> 55:41.254
I took that.

55:41.796 --> 55:42.839
Guys, come on.

55:45.675 --> 55:46.718
Here.

55:57.020 --> 55:58.021
Teddy!

55:59.731 --> 56:00.774
We did it.

56:01.399 --> 56:03.610
-We actually did it.
-Oh my God.

56:04.110 --> 56:06.946
Come on, next one.
Let's go. Wait, this way, right?

56:07.030 --> 56:09.407
-No, other way.
-Okay. Here.

56:14.537 --> 56:15.538
Susie!

56:18.166 --> 56:19.959
Yes! Oh my gosh.

56:22.587 --> 56:23.546
Yes.

56:25.882 --> 56:26.883
-Ronnie.
-I'm coming.

56:39.896 --> 56:41.815
It's the picture I took in the crypt.

56:59.666 --> 57:00.959
What is that?

57:04.754 --> 57:06.214
It's a clown.
