00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.810
you colluded with Cheoyong.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.560
Do you think I don't know?

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.840
Is that what you think?

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:17.540
You... never trusted me.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.120
No.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.160
I trusted you, truly.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.810
But you abandoned it

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.590
and ruined everything.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.590
Is that what you believe?

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.140
Would you say the same thing
if it were Bihyung?

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.280
Bihyung is different.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.660
Goblins don't betray.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.470
And foxes do?

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.410
Fine.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.600
I did it.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.990
Consider it all my doing.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.240
How's that?

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.820
Aren't you sorry?

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.100
You were the one
who did something you should be sorry for!

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.960
I was wrong
for trusting you from the start.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.770
I shouldn't have believed a fox.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.440
Oh, how sorry I am.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.890
But you enjoyed it, too.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.680
You shouldn't hang out
with a darned fox like me.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.160
You're a noble goblin, after all.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.410
Thinking about it again,

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.500
I don't think foxes are the problem,
but you.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.240
For betraying

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.760
and lying.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.200
Do you like living such a dirty life?

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.750
In the end,

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.890
you're the same as everyone else.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.800
Why?

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.680
Why did you confess back then?

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.420
I'll forget everything.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.240
You!

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.690
Why are you so cute?

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.730
You even got a confession from a goblin.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.670
I can't live anymore.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.520
I only have two minutes left.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.710
[Bihyung]

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.770
I'll keep my promise
and forget everything.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.800
But...

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.960
if we meet again by chance,

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.710
I'll tell you that I like you, too.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:21.390
Oh?
I haven't told him that I like him yet.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.180
My head hurts.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:54.090
[Bihyung]

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:55.960
Bihyung?

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.540
I'm blood type A, though?
[*T/N: "Bihyung"
sounds like blood type B in Korean.]

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.430
Wow.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.490
Did I drink this much alone?

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:09.820
It's not like I'm an old man.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.790
Wait, what is this place?

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:16.730
Right, Halmeoni
introduced me to this place.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:22.380
I drank so much.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.910
Huh?

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.760
Bihyung?

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:32.480
Huh?

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:34.680
Huh?

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.880
I didn't forget.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.810
I-I remember everything!

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.400
I remember everything!

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.280
Mister!

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.140
Mister!

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.160
Bihyung! Gildal!

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.220
I'm Keumbok! I'm back!

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.630
Mister.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.140
Who are you?

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.480
Are you here to see the house?

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.780
What?

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.990
In this economy,
it's rare to see such a cheap house.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.900
I heard the family living here
moved abroad.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.800
What?

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.060
[Closed]
[Thank you for your support
for Gumiho Plastic Surgery.]

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.960
I'm dreaming, right?

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.320
Ouch!

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.760
No way.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.040
Am I the one

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.650
who got forgotten?

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.930
I enjoyed my brief time here.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.780
Thanks for taking me in.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.890
I'll forget this

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.340
and return to being human.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.790
[Sugar]

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.060
[Salt]

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.980
I put labels
on the salt and sugar shakers.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.920
Don't mix them up anymore.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.630
[Chili powder] [Pepper]

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:41.100
[Chili powder] [Pepper] [Sugar] [Salt]

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.620
I'm sorry for leaving
without saying goodbye.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.570
Bihyung,

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.530
you're the coolest just as you are.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:58.610
You're not anyone's goblin, but Bihyung.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.570
Take care.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.340
Thank you for everything.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.790
From Superstar Keumbok.
