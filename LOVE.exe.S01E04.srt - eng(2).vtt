(Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and KOCCA)

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.240
(This is a work of fiction. All names, characters, )

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.410
(and incidents are products of the author's imagination.)

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.610
(All child actors were accompanied by a guardian, )

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.910
(and filmed in accordance with labour laws.)

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.150
It's beautiful.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.320
To think that with just black and white cells,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.920
they're essentially having a rich conversation.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.930
In a way, it's going from 3D to 2D.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.130
Wait, is that Professor Eum Nan Sae?

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.170
- The Eum Nan Sae? - About the QR code...

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.670
Is she a big deal? Isn't she just Winterbottom's sub?

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.169
If Winterbottom is twine,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.640
Eum Nan Sae is a climbing rope.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.449
A legend in Korean computer science.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.780
The youngest professor at POSTECH.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.520
And that same Professor Eum Nan Sae...

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.120
turned down tenure from, like, Melon University,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.820
to come back here. Can you guess why?

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.599
Sorry for being late, Professor.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.569
I had a school station interview...

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.900
about the awards for the Embedded Software Contest.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.740
- So I'm late. - Honey bees are disappearing.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.540
I'm sorry?

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.340
Humanity has less than...

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.910
100 years left.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.980
Professor, what are you talking about?

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.120
Now, I'm not here to preach some...

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.720
YOLO-esque optimism about living it up while we can.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.530
Everyone in this class...

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.360
is part of what you might call an Extinction Community.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.700
You're all sharing this era of extinction.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.100
That certainly makes for a special bond, doesn't it?

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.140
Now, I want you to form those communities.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.740
When you say "community,"

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.210
do you mean you want us to get into groups?

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.850
Yes.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.390
Professor, you need to make this announcement before you wrap up.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.890
Right.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.160
Professor Eum Nan Sae's Creative Integrated Design class...

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.699
has been named the signature course...

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.430
for our Converged Physical Tech Department...

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.499
and Global Content Development.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.900
Therefore, your work will be entered...

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.440
into the Hangang University President's Cup App Contest...

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.340
- will be automatically entered... - This all sounds...

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.650
a bit complicated, doesn't it?

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.380
They say the longer the explanation, the bigger the lie.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.520
In any case, you must form teams of four.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.920
Why do the teams have to be made of four people?

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.600
To debunk an East Asian superstition that the number four is unlucky.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.900
Pardon?

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.060
I'm kidding.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.870
Right, anyway.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.739
With this class size,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.380
teams of four are just easier for me to grade.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.480
All right then.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.750
And let me give you one word of caution.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.520
I will not be accepting proposals based on...

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.930
unrealistic concepts, such as manipulating human dreams...

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.060
to enable coding during sleep.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.860
Ideas that exist only as hollow shells designed...

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.170
to fool users without feasibility will be rejected.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.000
That is all.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.770
(Hangang University, Department of Computer Engineering)

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.770
That's it?

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.410
That's all?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.980
Does she know about our idea? How could she be so specific?

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.749
I don't know what that was all about,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.950
but I guess our project is on hold?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.250
Emergency meeting. Right here.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.320
In exactly 15 minutes.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.820
(15 Minutes Later)

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.559
Sorry. My bad.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.259
I skipped a step in my routine this morning...

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.530
and just hit with the runs.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.210
What's his deal?

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.540
This is for breaking your laptop yesterday.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.780
We decided to drop the formalities.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.650
You just did, too.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.150
- I did? - Accept it, San. We need to work.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.290
So I asked around...

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.030
and for the line of laptops you use,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.130
they said this one is the absolute best.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.630
Gosh, that's amazing. This one folds all the way back.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.540
I was rather hoping you'd just wire me the money.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.540
Hey, even the used price for this is higher than what you asked for.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.340
Since data recovery will be so hard, I guess this will have to do.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.980
You should at least appreciate the gesture.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.320
Fine. Thanks for keeping your word.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.520
Based on the lowest online price, minus my old one's depreciation,

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.860
I'll pay you back the difference.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.890
Anyway, we have to get on with our scheduled plans.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.400
What if Min Hak joins us for that?

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.040
- No way. - I already got approval to sit in.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.310
This is for computer engineering majors...

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.539
Not exclusively.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.750
According to the requirements, you must partner with a non-major.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.820
Plus, that makes a four-person team, just like our professor wanted.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.120
A celebrity just fell into our laps. How great is that?

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.189
I get that he's a "celebrity,"

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.430
who'd spray mist on a laptop, but...

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.030
Joo Yeon San from Cheongnyong Elementary School.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.200
That's you, right?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.710
Don't tell me they're long-lost childhood friends.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.750
If they are, that's a pretty tired trope.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.180
I'm sure he's about to explain.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.230
He's having a flashback.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.400
When he should be explaining, he's having a flashback instead.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.470
It only just hit me last night.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.970
Do you even remember the laptop you broke today?

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.609
You bent it, poured soda over it,

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.679
and tried drying it with a hairdryer!

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.549
I need it for my job, my schoolwork, and a competition,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.319
- which is why I came... - It's not like the spaceship...

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.450
would just stop in mid-air.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.620
As you explained, an EMP is an electromagnetic shockwave.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.720
So the spacecraft's computer systems would shut down...

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.190
That's her, always meticulously arguing every single point.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.330
The number two appears p-minus-two times.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.929
That's right! This year's champion of the Science Genius Quiz is...

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.130
Cheongnyong Elementary's 3rd-grader,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.030
- Joo Yeon San! - Joo Yeon San!

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.700
What's your deal?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
That's the tone.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.609
With that exact attitude,

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.340
I saw you on the live broadcast winning first place weekly, monthly,

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.909
and season-long.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.510
I even subscribed to your workbooks.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.480
- Hey! Stop! - Stop!

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.550
Jinx! Min Hak, you said nothing, and San I, you didn't hear a thing!

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.120
You just pushed her berserk button.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.820
Whatever. What's your deal?

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.060
What do you want from us?

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.630
(LOVE.exe)

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.960
(Episode 4: Forming Teams)

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.030
(Nine hours earlier, Somewhere in Seoul)

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.100
- Hey, I can't see anything. - Sorry.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.270
All right, this is the photo in question.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.340
They'll leak it in one month, which means we have 29 days left.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.210
Gosh, anyone can tell that's our Min Hak and Jinny.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.750
Jinny, you can see this, right?

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.250
Yes, I see it.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.050
Reporters will ask for confirmation, so here's the official story.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.260
Our line is, "We met casually on 'Match on Wheels.'"

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.530
This is in front of a hotel. That's hardly a "casual" setting.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.960
That's precisely why I called this meeting.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.670
The story is that you two just met by chance at the hotel bar.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.529
People aren't idiots.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.570
If we put out a clumsy denial...

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.340
and then it comes out that they've met before...

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.440
What you're saying is that we should admit it publicly?

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.850
- Excuse me? - He's asking if we should admit it.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.310
I'm just saying it's one of our options.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.420
What do they want?

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.480
Didn't say anything yet. Just to reveal it a month later.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.890
We can't trust scumbags like them. They could leak it tomorrow.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.530
Coming through.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.530
They could spread it, so we should just be honest...

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.000
Can you turn the screen, please? Toward Min Hak.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.010
Didn't you say you knew her?

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.350
Her, I mean. The owner of the laptop you broke.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.220
What?

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.920
- The Quiz King. - "Quiz King?"

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.790
Yes, the Quiz King I told you about.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.190
Turns out she goes to my university.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.730
The laptop owner is Quiz King, and Quiz King owns the laptop.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.789
Okay, none of that matters.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.470
Anyway, you'll say you met that girl in front of the hotel that day,

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.099
and I was coincidentally in the shot.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.200
- Got it? - Nice.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.370
Sir, if you spin this the right way,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.970
it looks like he's seeing her. Right?

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.040
Right!

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.750
Excuse me. I need a word with Jinny.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.350
I can't go along with this. It's not right.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.050
Joo Yeon San has nothing to do with us.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.690
It's not like this will hurt her.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.390
Honestly, Min Hak, you're not even a full-fledged celebrity yet.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.030
And she's just a regular person.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.599
I mean, they're just two students hanging out.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.400
How will that become a dating scandal?

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.730
Min Hak, we must think about our next level.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.240
Look, once Min Hak starts going to school,

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.570
students will post pictures anyway.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.110
He just has to go to his classes.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.010
And be seen being friendly with this girl.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.980
And then people naturally come up with their own stories about them.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.550
Okay.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.180
Say Min Hak focuses on his classes.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.119
How about the lost income during this time?

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.120
How will you cover that loss?

00:09:43.121 --> 00:09:44.590
Well, what do you propose?

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.290
He's asking what you want in return.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.329
I heard Jinny got a streaming original film gig.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.490
How about getting Min Hak in there as well?

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.100
I just met with Director Cha Nook, and I'm sure of it.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.099
I'll be in his next project.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.970
It'll be released globally on an OTT.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.840
This is such a crucial moment for my career.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.910
What? You mean acting?

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.879
Yes, someone like Bong or Chan.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.380
Or even the director of "Squid Game."

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.880
Why would directors of that calibre cast Min Hak?

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.020
What's wrong with Min Hak?

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.460
Excuse me. We're not blood-related, but he's like my little brother.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.120
Hey, you can't just talk about him like that...

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.300
Okay. Deal. Bong, Chan, Eun Sook, "Squid Game?"

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.870
Sure. I'll get them to contact you directly very soon.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.900
Could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.569
What is he saying?

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.340
Whatever OTT service it is, it doesn't matter.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.180
What's the point of putting him through these auditions?

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.850
What's the point of even giving him an audition?

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.320
- We've already seen what he can do. - We've already sized him up.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.020
And his acting is...

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.890
- uninspirational. - His acting is wooden, right?

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.360
He's also a triple threat, isn't he?

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.930
He's tone-deaf, can't dance, and has no rhythm.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.270
He's basically a tree up there. Anything for a client like this?

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.039
There was that XX Brand season opening party Jinny couldn't make,

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.509
and there's that new beauty show our subsidiary launched...

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.240
And maybe a couple of viral ads?

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.650
What do you say?

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.010
Deal?

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.280
Deal.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:23.750
Let's get some jjajangmyeon.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.430
Even if we have to grow apart for a while,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.530
we'll become more valuable...

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.670
Later, we'll be more "together?"

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.910
No. "Value." As in, V-A-L-U-E.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.609
- "Value." - Let's meet once...

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.840
we're more valuable.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.880
Min Hak, you can help me with this, can't you?

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:50.850
Yes.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.550
Jinny.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.760
Wait...

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:01.990
Min Hak, let's go.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:06.930
He said he was your fan, San. Sounds like a first crush, right?

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.969
Plus, the whole smart and nerdy image is...

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.400
trending these days,

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.600
so I guess they're trying to brand him as that kind of icon.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.410
Sorry. Was that too blunt?

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.640
So you figured it out.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.880
I'm already committing to the role.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.650
I even got bangs to look the part.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.620
Whose bright idea was it to come here?

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.190
Mine. All the classrooms are in use. The modelling majors took our lounge.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.860
Anyone have a better idea?

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.730
By the way,

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.330
is something still wrong?

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.070
This is usually a blind spot. If you're pulling an all-nighter,

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.670
it's the kind of spot where the guard turns off the lights.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.469
But right now, all eyes are on you.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.040
This'll be on Everytime any minute.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.940
With our faces in the photos too.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.309
I guess so.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.050
I've never been photographed so openly like this.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.990
Excuse me.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.130
If you're going to post this, please blur their faces.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.590
I'd really appreciate it.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.670
Sorry, I didn't mean to make you guys uncomfortable.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.370
They shouldn't be posting it in the first place, should they?

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.439
I feel like a celebrity's friend,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.410
and this special feeling I get...

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.710
isn't half bad.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:28.380
You two can continue your fan meet-and-greet here.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.110
Hang on, sit down.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.650
I'm actually curious too.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.020
Min Hak, you don't actually have to take this class.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.960
It's required for Computer Science, not Modelling.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.190
That's true.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.600
Why are you so gung-ho about this competition?

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.500
It's kind of hard to explain.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.540
Try me. I'm listening.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.910
Where do I even begin?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.940
Was I 11 at the time?

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.910
No, wait. I was in third grade, so...

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.420
Third grade...

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.920
- Ten. - Right, ten.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.760
Anyway, my grandfather was sick and had been hospitalized.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.860
- Okay. - It was a hospital in Eungam-dong.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.799
No, wait.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.499
Before I get to that, I should probably start from...

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.800
when my grandpa was raising my dad.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.800
Hey, can you just get to the point?

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.500
Oh, okay, so...

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.810
The age gap between my dad and me... I was ten, so my dad was...

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.710
- He can't have been 20, the gap... - Right.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.249
So when you were ten,

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.650
your grandpa, who raised your dad, was hospitalized...

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.119
and something happened...

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.520
that made you want to participate in this competition?

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.890
Yes, exactly.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.159
But what's most important is...

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.590
that we'd watch "Quiz King" weekly.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.400
I guess you want to be in an event like a competition for yourself.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.300
But if you only want to team up because I was a kid on quiz shows,

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.670
what about him?

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.809
So I have to vote for you? Thanks.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:07.880
Why him?

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.350
When San became the monthly champ, that's the kid who cried behind her.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.349
His name's Ban Ji No. He's in our department, too.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:13.379
(Ban Ji No, Changnam Elementary)

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.820
(Trait: Even the teacher finds him exhausting)

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.760
What a strange combination...

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.889
He says Hangang University is a stepping-stone...

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:24.160
for transferring to Seoul National.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.760
And he won't shut up about it.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.030
There are so many smart people here.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.630
But I don't want to team up with anyone else.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.700
I want to do this with you, San.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:40.380
Na Rae, why are you getting secondhand embarrassment?

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.180
- Java. - What?

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.150
Java.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.320
(Java: A popular programming language)

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.590
A pop quiz out of nowhere?

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.990
Like this?

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.460
So you don't know it.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.100
Can you let go?

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.700
How about Swift?

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.470
(Swift: A programming language for developing iOS-based apps)

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.540
Taylor?

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.840
Taylor Swift.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.840
That's such a dad joke.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.650
- Python. - Python?

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.819
Is that like "red sun" or something?

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.020
Py...

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.390
thon.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.619
I'm not sure...

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.100
San, it feels like you're taking an unfair shot at other majors.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.600
Kang Dong Won. Weren't you leading the opposition?

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.100
This is a completely different issue.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.869
Right. We don't all need to be coders.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.910
That was a cheap shot, Joo Yeon San.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.170
That's not like you. You're always so reasonable.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.610
And don't even start with the whole, "What's so 'me' about me?" routine.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.150
Look, I promise I'll work really hard.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.250
I'll study all the terms you asked about today,

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.319
and I'm well aware that in many ways I'm not exactly an ideal member...

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.860
You're not a member yet.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:06.560
We all have classes to get to, and we could use a change of scene.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:07.999
Let's just take a break for now.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.300
Min Hak, you're good with that?

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.829
Yes, I kept my whole day free for this.

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.570
- Okay. - I'm heading out.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.510
Okay.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.340
See you later.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.690
Just read the room and take it easy.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.060
You've taken enough pictures. Just make up some excuse...

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.830
and tell them you can't make it starting next week.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.470
Here, try this.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.800
Sponsored.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.040
What's with the look, Min Hak? I like it.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.480
I have to come up with a reason why this team needs me.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.480
- Come back with a solid argument. - An argument?

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.489
Nothing vague like "making memories."

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.890
A real reason why you should join.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.830
Like what you want to do with us, or what you can bring to the table.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.400
I admire your academic passion,

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.430
but you don't have to overdo it.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.370
This is all part of the act, you know?

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.640
If I want them to believe me, I have to be convincing.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.610
Right. You're really committed to the method.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.239
By the way, Min Hak, didn't you set a reminder...

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.750
for the feed update yesterday?

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.050
The manager over there called and said you missed the post time.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.080
"Heavy is the head that wears the crown."

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.450
It's a famous saying.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.960
Let's not be as irresponsible as some.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.260
The days when only tall, thin people could be models are over.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.400
In that sense, the merger of our two very different majors...

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.570
is perhaps just a natural sign of the times.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.370
The CompSci students?

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.810
It's okay. I can tell who's who without any help.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.640
I have very high hopes for our CompSci students.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.480
All right, shall we have you come up one by one and walk for us?

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.880
Be free, be edgy!

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.930
Mind your stride, long and smooth.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:16.790
Watch your foot placement.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.100
Excellent.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.730
Head up, like a string is pulling it from the top. That's it!

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.600
Your eyeline.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.340
Excellent.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.040
You're an absolute charm bomb. I love it.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.780
Okay, let's get our CompSci students up here, one by one.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.650
Yes, lovely!

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.620
That's it! With confidence.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.180
And the final pose!

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.520
A king!

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.250
All right, next.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.030
Okay, let's not smile.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.600
Be serious. Now, wipe that smile off your face.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.400
Right.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.140
Work that stride a little bit...

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.080
Gosh. That was good, though.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.380
All right, be confident. That's it, a confident power walk!

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.250
Hey, you did great. You really did.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.420
- I love this class! Right? - Kill the music.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:20.820
Kill it!

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.360
Music off!

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.660
You, in the polka-dot skirt.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.930
Why did you sign up for this class?

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.040
- Who, me? - Yes.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:36.110
It looked like fun.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.640
So you think you're a bit different, a little special?

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.410
- What? - That's fine.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.120
But let's let the audience call you special.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.950
If only you think you're special, you're not connecting with anyone.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.059
- Right. - I know it's just an elective,

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.560
but I don't know how can I teach you at this level.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.930
I'm going to run this class with an open mind.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.260
But if any of you signed up for this class just for fun,

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.200
you might want to consider dropping.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:08.040
I'm not pointing anyone out, so don't take it personally.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:09.339
All right, I'll give you some time.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.780
The Modelling majors, pair up and give pointers.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.879
I'll see you at the end of class.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.550
Now, pair up.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.720
Be free, be edgy.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.420
Is there a female CompSci major who wants to pair up?

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.590
Okay, chest out.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.420
Keep your feet parallel.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.730
Okay, that's good. Look forward.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.960
And just hold that tension...

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.800
You leaving?

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.810
Ever heard of that guy?

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.040
Professor Bi Gwang? No.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.550
If you try looking that guy up online...

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:51.650
Gosh.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.850
You're getting push around by him.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.190
He's not even in the industry. He knows nothing about walking.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.930
- It's a nepotism hire. - Nepotism?

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.560
- He's the Chairman's nephew. - The Chairman's nephew?

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.400
I heard they brought him in as some "Communications Expert,"

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.370
Communication, empathy, and walking? He's a total con artist. A fraud.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.770
You'll pass as long as you show up, so don't let him intimidate you.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.780
Forget all that. Just remember one thing.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.580
Confidence.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.880
Confidence?

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.180
All right, let's do this. Okay, feet parallel.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.690
- Parallel? - Yep. All right, go!

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:29.750
Go!

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.760
You can swing your arms a bit. Tuck your chin in slightly.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.760
- Tucked in. - Right. Eyes forward.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.029
- Like this? - Hey, don't be so self-conscious.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.630
Say, "I'm a gift from the skies."

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.200
- Walk. - "I'm a gift from the skies."

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.070
All right, "I parachuted my way in."

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.370
"I parachuted my way in."

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.780
(Department of Modelling, Class in progress)

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.620
I didn't feel a draft a second ago.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.019
You said it'd be cool, spacious, with no people.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.190
Is this the best you could do?

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.890
- It's all due to climate change. - No, it's because of the merger.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.520
You're coming to the meeting, right?

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.060
We're electing an emergency chair, so you have to come.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.530
We can't let the Modelling Majors walk all over us.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.970
- Na Rae, this is for you. - What?

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.000
Kang Min Hak, you really...

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.539
You're handsome and sweet, too?

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.810
Are you the only one?

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.310
That was my way of saying thanks, you know?

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.280
(28 Minutes Later)

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.650
Okay, our next idea. Sweet Home.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:40.220
Honestly, this is an idea I've been keeping up my sleeve.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.760
If you have a spare room, you take pictures of it beforehand.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.099
You post them on a popular site,

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.870
and when foreign tourists see them,

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.040
they'll book your room over a hotel and they pay you.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.770
And the homeowner gets to rent out their room...

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.010
Airbnb...

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.940
Okay, let's stop there.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.680
What?

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:04.610
Look.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.819
Min Hak, it's not a personal attack.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.390
But what we need right now is...

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:14.259
someone to help manage future risks...

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.230
while developing our contest app.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.130
Someone with actual solutions.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.930
But in the less than half a day we've spent with you,

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.069
we're already background characters...

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.640
in your social media posts.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.240
And now our looks are getting rated.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.770
You're becoming a liability.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:33.039
Rating our looks? Who are those jerks? Darn it.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.040
I'm not going to let them get away with this.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.510
Sorry, but can I see it? That post on Everytime.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.700
I'll take care of it.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.300
And... I'm sorry.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.140
I apologise.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:02.739
That "Engineering student vibe?"

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.210
I have no idea what that is,

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.980
but you needed that look for your pics, and if...

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.509
No, if we were okay with being props,

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.350
you've already got what you came for.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.050
I don't have any more time to waste on your little performance.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.750
No, scratch that. I don't want to waste any more time.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.520
Hey!

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.530
You're being way too harsh today.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.360
Hey, Min Hak! Let's take five, okay?

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.060
- Sure. - Yes.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.300
Just a second. Come on.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.700
That's it.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.340
I think we need a moment to discuss our governance policy.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:36.870
Maybe I should go get some fresh air.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.180
Did you really have to go that far?

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.009
Even if his head is in the clouds,

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.250
you can't humiliate him like that.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.879
So what if he wanted that nerdy look...

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.590
to post pics with us?

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:52.359
Even if he is a clueless guy and has used us,

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.490
he still has feelings, right?

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.430
Na Rae, are you taking Min Hak's side right now?

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.560
Why does there have to be sides in this?

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.200
- Gosh, you scared me. - Want to know what I really think?

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.139
- What the... - Yeon San, I totally get why...

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.910
you keep pushing Min Hak away.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.439
He’s got a full-blown celebrity complex...

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.410
and offers to sigh his autograph, blabbering "Ahn In Dae."

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.209
He brags about you being the Quiz King.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.579
He broke your laptop,

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.749
made you lose out on the scholarship,

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.450
and forces you into the limelight when you hate attention.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.750
I admit, he's been a complete walking disaster.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:28.060
But it's not like Min Hak meant to do any of that, right?

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:30.760
The guy's a total blank slate.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.630
There's nothing going on inside that pretty little head.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.570
You know it's better to write code from scratch than fix a buggy mess?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.140
So let's be the ones to fill his blank slate...

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.510
with a beautiful programming language.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.640
You're worse than she is, you know that?

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.480
It seems to me you're pretending to have Min Hak's back,

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.380
but you're getting all your jabs in anyway.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.090
Hang in there.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:00.589
On the other hand,

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.760
don't you think our world-view is a little limited?

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.329
What do the three of us do all day?

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:05.559
We wake up and get on the computer.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.560
Eat and then get on the computer.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.560
Come to school and get the computer.

00:27:07.561 --> 00:27:09.230
We even get on the computer before we go to bed.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.200
Speak for yourself. I actually have relationships in the real world.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.599
Min Hak lives in another world.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.440
He's on another operating system.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.610
An operating system?

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.610
But it's compatible with a lot of different operating systems.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.780
Like us? Even though we're different?

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:28.420
In that case, Min Hak's experience and perspective could help us grow.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.590
Plus, we can finally even out our gender ratio.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:34.020
- There are other guys in class... - You could say that,

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:35.790
but who's actually asked to join our team?

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.860
Excuse me.

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:44.930
Don't fight because of me.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.640
I'll just leave.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.509
I wasn't seeking a reason to join.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.140
I was trying to see why you'd want me on the team,

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.510
but thinking about it, I can't find one either.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.350
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused, even if it was unintentional.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.950
But it was nice meeting you all.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.890
I've always really wanted to meet Joo Yeon San.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.330
I even imagined what it would be like...

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.100
to be on the same team as a genius like you.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.130
I guess I just got carried away.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.990
Hey. Yeon San.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.530
If I were really a genius,

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.600
I probably wouldn't be here arguing with you.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:02.780
San, it's one thing not to work with him,

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.480
but are you really just going to let him leave?

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:10.950
Kang Min Hak, wait!

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.299
And just like that, I crashed.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.340
Joo Yeon San.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.680
I should've seen the signs, starting with that bizarre dream.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.750
My firewall must have been compromised.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.350
Over-processing inputs repeatedly created an overblown output.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.119
The Quiz King bit is a sore spot,

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.590
but I thought I was over it.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:51.630
But that's just an excuse.

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.530
I am the error now.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.470
To use a PC analogy, it's like my cooling fan is broken.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:05.110
The fact that I keep overheating is proof that he's getting to me.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.680
To think that my past few weeks, like a cheesy rom-com I worked on,

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.880
were all a build-up to me ending up in this la-la land.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.480
It's so unfair. It's infuriating. This isn't rational.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.359
So, to fixate on a meaningless dream...

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.790
and push him away like this...

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.860
might actually be the more irrational choice.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.130
Admit the error and correct course.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.520
San.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:58.130
Oh, right.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.029
First, I should apologise too.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.070
The heat, humidity, media environment,

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.269
and the school's arbitrary rules...

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.640
I think all of these variables affected our communication...

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.009
and made things worse.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.740
How about we find an empty classroom and try again tomorrow...

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:14.910
Sorry.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.350
It's okay. An alarm can go off.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.580
(Next: Stay Green Live Ad at 3:00pm)

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:20.820
Speaking of which...

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.850
- I have a scheduled ad time. - What?

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.460
This won't take long. Just give me a minute.

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:35.200
Why the breath spray?

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.270
Hey, everyone! You're with me on StayGreen, right?

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.800
From the eco-friendly golf course, Stay Green CC,

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:43.639
- An eco-friendly golf course? - we're raffling off tickets...

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.240
at our eco-friendly flea market.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:49.350
What a relief. My cooling fan is running again.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:52.580
I put the link in my bio, so make sure you all sign up.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:56.719
On the course, let's get some eagles and albatrosses together.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.850
Bye!

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.400
(How it feels to be an engineering student)

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.710
Influencer, engineering major, boyfriend material pics.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:16.910
(Hello)

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.039
What?

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.010
(Hello)

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:23.150
Hello. This is movie director Bong Joon...

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.780
The reason I'm writing is that I'd like to meet Kang Min Hak...

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.990
Bong!

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:31.790
A burner account?

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.659
Darn it, who are they kidding?

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.060
(Up yours!)

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.340
What? You're done already?

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:50.710
I'm not doing this anymore.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:53.480
What? What about your promise to Jinny?

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.810
This whole thing was ridiculous from the start.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:00.350
Let's just find another way.

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:08.490
(12 Years Earlier)

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:11.460
(Kang Min Hak, 10, 3rd Grade, Myeongin Elementary)

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:12.730
(Hobbies: Magnetic tops, quiz shows)

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.060
- Min Hak. - And once again,

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.200
young Joo Yeon San was the quickest on the buzzer.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.800
- Min Hak. - Yes, Grandpa?

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.140
The men in our family line have had handsome features,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.969
tall frames, and gentle natures.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:25.380
But not a single one of our ancestors...

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.040
ever managed to hold public office.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.909
I know.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.510
You said we were a line of blockheads.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.420
Your father could barely even read, yet he got lucky with the times...

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.350
and now struts around like a big shot.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:40.660
But how long do you think getting by on a pretty face will last?

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:45.030
In today's harsh society, for men like me and your father,

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:47.600
just having a handsome face and a tall frame...

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.370
is completely worthless.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:52.269
Yes. I'm always mindful of that.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.340
The correct answer is EMP, which means electromagnetic pulse.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.269
You'll start balding around 40.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.670
From that point on,

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.979
for men like us, who get by on our looks,

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.710
our value will just plummet.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:07.580
(Joo Yeon San, Ban Ji No)

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.020
Grandpa!

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.290
Grandpa!

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:14.259
Just like how the fool Ondal met Princess Pyeonggang,

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.260
you need to marry a smart woman.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.729
Our family isn't blessed with brains,

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:19.930
so improving our gene pool...

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:24.730
is the only way we'll survive in the 21st century!

00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:26.900
A smart woman like Princess Pyeonggang?

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.140
Like that kid, Joo Yeon San, the Quiz King?

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:33.110
Dream on! She's the monthly quiz show champ.

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:36.050
Why would a girl that brilliant give you the time of day?

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.310
That's what I was thinking!

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.180
Of course, if the stars align...

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.190
and a talent like her were to actually give you a chance...

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.950
Joo Yeon San.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:47.490
If you get this right, you will win the title.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.330
The number two appears p-minus-two times.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:53.900
That's right! This year's champion of the Science Genius Quiz is...

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.770
Cheongnyong Elementary's 3rd-grader, Joo Yeon San!

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:00.640
Cheongnyong Elementary School, Joo Yeon San...
