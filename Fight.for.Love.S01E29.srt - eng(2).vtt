Deputy Shen,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.060
what does he mean?

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.570
Could it be

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.590
a trick?

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.570
Never mind.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.060
He's an old acquaintance.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.620
Let's wait; no need to make a move.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.460
Supervisor Gu, what do you mean?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.730
If you don't explain,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.590
I won't know

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.900
what you're going to do.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.500
I am willing

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.780
to surrender to North Qi.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.410
What did you say?

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.850
I can't hear you.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.410
I am willing

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.140
to surrender to North Qi.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.170
I'll open the city gates

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.290
and let your soldiers in.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.700
As expected of Supervisor Gu.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.290
You always know when to yield

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.860
and how to adapt.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.170
In that case,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.580
my mounting block is missing.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.120
May I borrow

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.930
your shoulders?

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.450
Stop!

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.500
Stop!

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.740
Shen You,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.780
I beg you not to kill anymore.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.170
I'll do anything you ask.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.980
Commander Gao,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.060
after you.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.060
(Sui)

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.700
(Dingjun Gate)

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160
Urgent report.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.160
Qingzhou has surrendered.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.400
Fengling is in critical danger.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.970
Greetings, Young Marquis.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.180
No need for formalities.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.100
It was hard to find you.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.570
Please.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.260
I've been lying low in North Qi
for over 20 years,

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.170
but I never got inside the royal court.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.460
When your father passed away,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.410
I was heartbroken,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.100
but I dared not act rashly

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.930
until recently,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.730
when Yunyang recruited troops

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.370
to welcome her son

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.270
back to North Qi to claim the throne.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.830
This perfect opportunity

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:30.930
was right at my doorstep.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.650
I couldn't let it slip away

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.770
and pledged allegiance to Yunyang.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.200
Then I won her trust

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.460
bit by bit.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.770
So, now is indeed

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:40.710
the best time to drive

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.600
a wedge between them

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.100
and break North Qi apart.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.720
You chose to take the risk

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.850
and send me a letter now.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.920
You must've assessed the situation

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.030
and prepared a plan.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.180
You flatter me.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.820
Young Marquis, rest assured,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.460
I have a few tricks

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.660
up my sleeve.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.450
In that case,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.330
I'll get straight to the point.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.000
I need an identity

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.180
to infiltrate the royal court

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.480
and assassinate Su Can,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.420
forcing them to retreat.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.540
Young Marquis,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.300
we just met,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.080
and you've given me

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.540
such a difficult task.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:18.850
Urgent report!

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.320
Urgent report.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.100
Supervisor Gu has surrendered
to the enemy.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.000
Qingzhou City

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.940
has fallen.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.020
Gu Chusheng

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.850
has surrendered?

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.380
(Sui, Qi)

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.770
We can't wait any longer.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.540
Now,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.420
there's only one way out.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.780
Young Marquis,

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.470
what are your chances of success?

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.920
Before death,
I don't ask about the future.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.180
On the battlefield,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.580
I don't weigh pros and cons.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.010
Since this is my choice,

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.550
I have to bear

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.490
all the consequences.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.300
Chu Yu,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.180
if I can come back alive this time,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.420
I'll take you to a place

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.490
with mountains and waters,

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.970
away from the world,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.060
and live a peaceful life together.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:29.260
(Hot Spring Villa)

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.950
Are you willing to talk to me today?

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.820
You really want to kill me.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.180
I once told you:

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.670
The thing I hate the most

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.890
is being deceived.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.260
Zhao Yue,

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.770
I ask you once more:

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.820
Who are you really?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.220
Do you still remember

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.150
the Lord of Qin
who colluded with your enemy?

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.460
The woman who had an affair

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.770
with him was my mother,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.250
Princess Yunyang of North Qi.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.180
I'm that child born after his death.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.940
I see.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.700
Since you approached me,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.130
you've been deceiving me.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.180
You became my subject

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.480
just to covet

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.130
the realm of Great Sui.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.550
I actually thought

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.770
you were different from others,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.970
and you truly understood me.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.970
Even if I can't kill you,

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.940
I won't submit to you.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.820
I'm almost done healing you,

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.460
so I won't let you get hurt again.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.030
I'll take you to a place

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.270
where you'll never be sad again.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.870
Everyone will bless us there.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:36.810
But

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.180
before that,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.180
I will hold a sacrificial ceremony

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.300
in this villa

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.710
to seek the blessings of the deer god

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.610
for the North Qi soldiers to win.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.780
At that time,

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.890
you must attend with me.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.700
Do you know what you're saying?

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.790
I am the Princess of Great Sui.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.340
You will marry me sooner or later.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.720
As the future Queen of North Qi,

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.220
you surely have to worship with me.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.490
I will never marry you,

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.300
nor will I go to worship with you.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.970
Zhao Yue,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.060
you are humiliating me.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.730
Humiliating you?

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.600
I want you to worship with me.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.820
That's a unique honor.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.970
You should cherish it.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.580
You're a liar full of deceit.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.330
Yes.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.220
I have lied a thousand times,

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.130
but I've never lied

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.700
about my love for you.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.330
You love me?

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.890
Is that why you deceive me,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.780
imprison me,

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.450
humiliate me,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.730
and bring me here?

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.080
You might as well just kill me!

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.540
Wouldn't it be good to be with me?

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.060
In this vast world,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.180
it's just the two of us.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.690
I can give you everything you want.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.370
No one will ever bully you

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.970
or humiliate you again.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.840
Look.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.890
I lit all these red candles

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.810
in the room for you.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.460
I want you to shine forever.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.660
Marry me,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.910
and be my queen.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.440
You'll be the only queen in the world.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.820
In your dreams!

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.610
The Xue Hanmei

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.130
I once loved

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.820
has died today.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.940
(Gu Chusheng surrendered;
Wei Yun is missing. Shen You)

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.780
Good.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.080
Qingzhou is now

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.060
within our grasp;

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.390
Fengling will soon belong

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.460
to North Qi.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.590
It must be the blessing of the deer god.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.620
Therefore, the grand ceremony

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.220
must be ensured to be flawless.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.090
I understand.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.780
(Hot Spring Villa)

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.570
Commander,

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.630
Ms. Chu hasn't come out

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:51.470
since she went in.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.760
What if something has happened?

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.900
Don't talk nonsense.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.460
She is Chu Yu.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.340
Nothing will happen to her.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.800
This villa is in a remote location,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.940
guarded by lots of troops.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.230
I sneaked in and probed around.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.370
I found a workshop

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.850
underneath the villa.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.020
Good.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.650
You will be the commander this time;

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.730
I will follow your lead.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.310
Lately,

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.370
they've been busy preparing

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.210
for the ceremony
to celebrate their victory.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.560
I will disguise myself as a maid

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.600
and sneak in

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.540
to create chaos.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.490
Then everyone can also sneak in

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.060
and blow up the workshop.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:55.690
Lu Qiba,

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.880
this mission is essential.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.460
Everyone must be very careful.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:04.790
Have you prepared

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.790
everything I asked for?

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:06.820
Everything is ready.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:56.490
Seize the assassin!

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.780
Yes.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.980
(If I leave now,)

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.710
(Xue Hanmei
will search the entire villa)

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.260
(for the assassin,)

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.740
(and our squad might be exposed.)

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.340
(So,)

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.580
(I have to stay.)

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.900
Long time no see,

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.250
Ms. Chu.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.060
To celebrate our reunion,

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.680
I should offer you a cup of wine,

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.420
but you seem

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.260
rather inconvenient.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.420
Xue Hanmei,

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.640
you are the son
of Princess Yunyang, right?

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.890
You've been plotting for so long

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.480
to scheme against Great Sui.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.670
I am not only

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.820
the son of Princess Yunyang,

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.510
but also the only descendant

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:56.750
of the Lord of Qin in Great Sui.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.900
I'm Zhao Yue.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.500
Ms. Chu,

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.780
you may treat me as your king.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.940
So,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.170
you instigated Yao Yong,

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.070
caused 70,000 Wei troops

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.030
to die in Baidi Valley,

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.200
stole the octagonal crossbow,

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.340
and harmed my family.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.300
You did all those things.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.490
Not just these.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.420
Guess again.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.640
I've been hiding in Great Sui for years,

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.170
with the Eldest Princess as my cover.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.060
If I only did this much,

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.500
wouldn't it be a pity?

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.350
Let me tell you the truth.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.620
I also killed

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.060
Chancellor Gu.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.510
What a pity.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.500
I intended to proceed slowly,

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.500
but I didn't expect

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.850
you and Wei Yun to start investigating.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.240
From the moment you deceived

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.180
the Eldest Princess,

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.450
you should've known

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.790
that you'd be exposed one day.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.820
If you hadn't traced to Qinxi Valley

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.410
and fabricated the assassination
by North Qi assassins,

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.580
she'd never have suspected me.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.610
You forced me

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.100
to start the war sooner.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.470
You and Wei Yun have always wanted

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.020
to avenge the Chu and Wei families.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.300
Now, you know

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.580
that it was me

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.000
who killed your father,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.160
wiped out the Wei family,

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.820
and killed 70,000 Wei troops.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.940
Chu Yu,

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:07.530
you must hate me.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.790
You harmed my country and family.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.410
We are mortal enemies once we meet.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.860
But, Zhao Yue,

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.640
do you deserve the Eldest Princess?

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.850
Of course, I do.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.820
How did Emperor Chunde treat her?

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.130
He left her full of wounds.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.620
It was I

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.690
who healed her bit by bit.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.060
How could you know

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.100
how well I've treated her?

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:33.540
I'll try to make her

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.960
the Queen of both Great Sui

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.900
and North Qi.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.140
What a pity.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.060
You don't understand her at all.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.510
No wonder

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.650
she doesn't love you at all.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.410
Since you mentioned Changming...

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:56.820
Lock her up first.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.820
When Changming wakes up,

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.070
let her see clearly

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.340
the person she misses.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.900
Take her away.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.540
(Wei)

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.170
Is the man who came indeed Wei Yun?

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.310
Your Majesty,

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.160
I have brought

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.370
Wei Yun's head

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:01.930
and the Wei token as proof.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.270
How dare you present

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:06.500
such a bloody and filthy thing?

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.440
What if it disturbs the Emperor

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.380
and the Eldest Princess?

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.650
Take it away.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.210
Wait.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.220
(Wei)

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.120
(Wei)
It seems that Wei Yun

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.820
was really at his wits' end

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.400
and had to take a desperate measure.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:52.930
He did have some courage,

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.240
but unfortunately,

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.610
his opponent was me.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:59.130
How about Qingzhou?

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.550
Your Highness,

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:02.540
we've occupied Qingzhou.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.370
There are still some men in the city,

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.060
but they are all cowards

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.650
and have all surrendered.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.920
Now,

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.990
it is the time for our army

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.650
to reap the fruits of victory.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.250
Servants,

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.370
prepare the armor for me.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.230
I will lead the troops personally

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.020
and subdue Qingzhou myself.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:43.860
(Fengling City)

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.580
(General's Mansion)

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.640
North Qi is attacking again?

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.860
Yes.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:50.970
Report from the scout:

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.850
North Qi is going all out

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.710
with a determination
to fight to the death.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.250
How many people

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.170
do we have left now?

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.710
Including the old, weak,
sick, and disabled,

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.890
we have just 3,000.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:29.540
3,000...

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.420
That's enough.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:35.550
Chu Shan, gather everyone

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:36.750
and assemble at the city gate.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.860
The only way

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.850
to resolve the crisis in Fengling

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:43.130
is to destroy North Qi's war chariots.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.030
To destroy the war chariots,

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.500
we have to get close.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:47.920
General Chu,

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.610
this is going to certain death.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.340
Can't we wait for Ms. Chu?

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.480
The enemy won't give us

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.420
the time to wait.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.860
Moreover,

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.890
how can we pin our hopes

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.020
on Yu alone?

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.930
Whatever happens on her side,

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.580
we must hold on to Fengling

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.130
to the death.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.780
If we hold on,

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.610
we might also resolve Yu's crisis.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.050
General Chu,

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.620
let me go.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.020
If I can die meaningfully,

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.100
why not go?

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.060
Why cherish life

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.580
and fear death?

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.300
I'm willing to risk my life

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.100
for the country.

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:37.610
To protect my homeland,

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.780
even if it means death,

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:41.930
I have no regrets.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:44.650
But your leg injury hasn't healed.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.610
How can you go to the battlefield?

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.130
We have Physician Song, right?

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.740
(Peace and Prosperity)

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.060
Even if I can't lift a sword

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.140
or ride a horse,

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.130
you will surely have a way,

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.780
right?

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.370
You're our military physician.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.740
The octagonal crossbow chariot

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.340
is extremely powerful.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.020
We must destroy it.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.450
I want to take a chance.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.930
If I help you return to the battlefield,

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.020
it'd be like sending you
to certain death.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.170
That'd be too cruel for me.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.740
If my death

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.740
can protect this city,

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.260
the people you save

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.370
will not just be me.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.980
Do you think I want to stop you?

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.260
You're underestimating me.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.930
I've always known

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.200
that the man I like

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.640
is a brave

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.580
great hero,

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.650
who has long put life aside

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.130
to protect the people of the city,

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.170
and is not afraid of death.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.410
Linyang,

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:18.610
since I understand you,

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.540
how could I not support you?

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.720
I will use silver needles

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.300
to seal your five acupoints,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.140
including Yongquan,

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:37.210
Xuehai,

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.690
Chengshan,

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.930
Futu, and Jiexi.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.790
Then I'll use Chuan Xiong,

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:43.680
Ru Xiang,

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.620
Wu Ling Zhi,

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.010
and Yu Jin

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.020
to make a medicine.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:50.790
In this way,

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.340
you will not feel pain

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.070
and can walk and ride

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.170
like a normal person.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.540
But the effect only lasts for two hours.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.400
After two hours...

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.500
That's enough.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.940
Thank you,

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.500
Miss Song.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.820
Linyang,

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:33.200
can you call me

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.260
Tuantuan one more time?

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.110
The one who treated you before
was Tuantuan,

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.050
and the one who sends you
to the battlefield now

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:41.790
is also Tuantuan.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:51.970
Thank you,

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.140
Tuantuan.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:06.260
(Fengling City)

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:14.300
Everyone knows

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.480
that if we lose Fengling,

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.130
North Qi can drive straight to Huajing,

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.230
and Great Sui will be in danger.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.010
We cannot

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.900
lose

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:27.490
this battle.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.890
The key to winning this battle

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.750
lies in the octagonal crossbow chariot.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.890
The war chariot seems to be powerful,

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.650
but it has

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:37.580
a fatal weakness.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.530
-Weakness?
-What is it?

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.620
I don't know.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.540
The mechanism on the North Qi chariot

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.620
is very fragile.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.820
If it is hit by brute force

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:53.170
during the firing process,

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.050
the war chariot
will not be able to operate.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.960
It's like the vital spot of a snake.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.340
- Understood.
- That's true.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:02.510
Now, it's easier.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:03.720
Just hit this spot.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.740
Yes, yes.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:06.090
General Chu,

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.710
the war chariot is in the enemy's camp.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.260
If we want to smash the mechanism,

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.380
wouldn't that mean...

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.860
Kid,

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.620
isn't that

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.260
just nonsense?

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.920
It's so far away.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.590
Even a deity

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.730
wouldn't be able to shoot it.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:21.730
We have

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.610
to face them

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:24.730
head-on.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.920
Some of us

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.060
have to charge there

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.580
and engage in close combat.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.740
Naturally, those who go

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.540
will surely not return.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.900
This...

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.140
This...

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.610
Am I right,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.260
General Chu?

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.450
How dare you!

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:52.650
You are right.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.060
This is indeed

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.340
a one-way trip.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.410
Even so,

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.380
is there anyone

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:11.250
willing to follow me?

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.980
I'm willing to follow you

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.050
and fight for Great Sui.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.100
Kid,

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.650
how can you be so blind?

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:28.900
With grandfathers like us here,

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.940
when is it your turn to show off?

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.580
Get back.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.380
General Chu,

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.650
have you forgotten

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.170
that we joined the army

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.460
because

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:43.810
we were bored?

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.880
Brothers,

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.820
step forward.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.100
General Chu,

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.220
I'm Zhang Huan.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.820
I'm Wang Chang.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.780
I'm Shi Lüguang.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.900
I'm Yang An.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.260
I'm Zhao Shitou.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.780
I'm Wang Huan.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.060
Six former generals

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.540
who once served

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.780
General Chu Jianchang

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.540
request to go into battle.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.900
You used to serve my father?

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.810
Like father, like son.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.210
We are determined

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.380
to destroy the war chariot

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.020
and defend Fengling with our lives.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.020
With your help,

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.730
we can surely do this.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.380
Chu Shan,

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:01.690
you'll be in charge

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.260
of the city defense

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.770
this time.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.980
Can you do that?

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.460
I won't fail!

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.220
- Slowly.
- Give me a hand.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.360
- Coming.
- Anyone there?

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.220
- Help!
- Thanks.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.240
Give me a hand.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.070
Help over there.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.360
- Let me.
- I can do it myself.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.300
It's okay.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.450
Let me.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.820
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.000
I'll take care of this for you.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:20.940
Thank you.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.130
Come on.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.050
Wenchang.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.710
Are you okay?

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:29.880
- I'm fine.
- Thanks.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.800
We have to settle

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.640
everyone down first.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:32.550
Report!

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.550
Qingzhou has fallen.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:35.740
Supervisor Gu has surrendered.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.860
Wenchang,

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.030
where are you going?

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.960
To rescue.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.740
Going there now is
like walking into a trap.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.840
I've noticed that your mood has been off

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.900
since we left Qingzhou.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360
Song Wenchang,

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.300
calm down.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.540
I can't calm down at all.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.970
Let go.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:54.050
Let go!

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.260
Get lost!

00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.970
Jin.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.380
Why are you here?

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.490
Jin, you slapped me.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:12.510
You punched your brother,

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:13.450
so I slapped you.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:15.050
What?

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.320
Are you going to slap me?

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:23.980
If Shen You hadn't found out

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:25.130
that I was not Yun,

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.830
Qingzhou wouldn't have fallen.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.730
I've failed Yun

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.290
and everyone's trust.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:31.710
I want to make up for it.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.260
Am I wrong?

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:36.770
None of these is wrong.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.930
If you don't even dare to
make up for it,

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:40.230
I wouldn't have come,

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.610
let alone slap you.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.360
I slapped you

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.770
to make you calm down

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:51.500
and think clearly

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.420
about what you can do

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:54.690
and what you should do.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.250
I know you're very confused now.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.100
You take on all those things

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.770
and rush back to Qingzhou

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.900
because you feel guilty inside.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.330
You keep working to help them,

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.690
not because you're not tired,

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.330
but because

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.210
you're afraid to see

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:18.850
everyone's disappointed faces

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:19.980
in your dreams.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:23.100
I'm not good enough.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.670
Yun gave me

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:27.710
such an important task,

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:28.650
and I promised him

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.610
I could do it.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.100
I thought I was

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.060
a very brave man,

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:35.450
but I didn't expect

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.250
that Shen You's arrow

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.100
would expose my flaw.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:42.580
Stop belittling yourself.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.940
If you were really a coward,

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.730
I wouldn't bother to talk to you.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.230
Whether it's living a life

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:49.330
or finding a husband,

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.550
my standards

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:51.610
are top-notch.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:53.090
Song Wenchang,

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.940
don't ever let me down.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.250
Though you meant well,

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.740
that slap

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:08.290
was indeed too harsh.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.480
He promised me he wouldn't go to war,

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.350
and he broke his word.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.110
I haven't settled the account
with him yet.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.710
He's just too much trouble,

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.590
making me travel

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:17.530
all the way to Qingzhou.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.290
This slap is actually nothing.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:22.540
So, you came

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.460
because you were worried about me.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.670
What are you talking about?

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:28.540
I was just passing by.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.980
You don't mean it,

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.380
but it doesn't matter.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.520
I know it when you're telling the truth.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.360
Alright.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.000
This is not the time to talk about that.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.630
Let's discuss how

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.060
to resolve the situation in Qingzhou.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:44.900
I believe Chusheng
didn't really surrender.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.280
There must be a reason

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.290
behind his actions.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.540
But the North Qi people
are born brutal.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.740
I'm worried

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:52.450
that Chusheng

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:54.020
is now in extreme danger.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:55.630
When we captured Xu Lingzhang,

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.280
we used the secret passage in Qingzhou.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:59.160
This time, we can also take
the secret passage

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.100
to find Supervisor Gu.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.040
Once we find Chusheng,

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:02.010
maybe we can find

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:03.820
a breakthrough from him.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.280
There's no time to waste.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.180
Let's count our numbers

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:07.140
and set off immediately.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.010
Shilan,

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.300
sorry about that punch.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.550
Consider it a debt.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:13.710
Once we retake Qingzhou,

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:14.810
I'll settle it with you.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.060
Go at ease.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.980
Leave it to me and Wanyue.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.640
We'll take care of everyone here.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:25.500
Thank you, Ms. Chu Jin.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:27.530
Let's go.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:34.780
Song Wenchang,

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.650
although I said

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.150
I would never marry

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:56.610
a man who goes to war,

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:58.010
it's not

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.510
impossible to make

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:01.940
a small exception.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.490
So,

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.250
come back safely.

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.190
What's wrong?

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:16.580
Did I touch your wound?

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.970
No, no.

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.130
I'm okay.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:20.650
I'm totally fine.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.340
I'm off then.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.420
