00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.560
There are 131 hotels,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.400
guesthouses,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.359
and occasional

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.280
accommodations

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:40.760
for tourists on Mount Qingcheng.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.760
Exclude those

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:42.879
under 500 yuan per night,

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:43.640
without suites,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.000
not wheelchair accessible,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.920
and overly flashy

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.680
or tacky.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.040
Only a dozen remain.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:49.359
Bai Xiaoling

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.280
and Zeng Jie

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.040
would only pick

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.920
among those

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.799
better options.

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:54.319
It's easy to find them.

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:55.879
Easy job, huh?

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:03.319
Mr. Li.

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.200
De.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.280
Are you okay?

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:12.560
You look exhausted.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.400
I'm fine. Just been really busy.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.599
Go on. I'm listening.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.800
Where were we?

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.199
You've already narrowed down

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.360
their hotel options.

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:28.520
Impressive.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.120
It's a tight scope.

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.360
I've narrowed it down

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:33.840
to these three hotels.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.800
They're

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.680
most likely here.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.400
Wait.

00:02:38.112 --> 00:02:39.168
What are you trying to do?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.439
I'll go on a trip

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.159
and "run into" my friend.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.840
It's reasonable to meet up

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.919
for a meal, right?

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.240
It sounds reasonable,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.719
but feels off somehow.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:51.520
Bro.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.080
Do you have

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.520
so little faith in me?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.639
It's not that.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:57.560
I'm just cautious.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.319
Who knows what trouble you'll stir up?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.759
I'm going anyway.

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.240
What's the plan?

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.000
Don't worry.

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:07.080
I'll abide by the law.

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.240
I'll simply check

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.960
the parking lots

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.840
for Zeng Jie's car.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120
Fine. Go ahead.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.639
Tell me when you arrive.

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:15.680
What for?

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:16.919
You'll monitor Zeng Jie?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.240
Of course not.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.879
I hope it goes well.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.199
What could go wrong?

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.400
Bai Xiaoling

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.240
called me today.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:29.599
I think

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:30.919
she also anticipates

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.199
something bad.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.039
If you were Zeng Jie,

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:39.360
how would you kill

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.240
Bai Xiaoling?

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280
She's disabled.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.560
I'd stage an accident.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.960
A cliff fall

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.120
or drowning.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.800
This is what

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.560
I fear the most.

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:57.319
Same here.

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.360
Do something if you care.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.360
What can I do?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.439
Arrest Zeng Jie?

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.280
You're joking.

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:07.560
What did she say

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.360
on the phone?

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.759
I won't tell you.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.000
She mentioned Liu Wei.

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:15.199
Liu Wei?

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.199
She knows Liu Wei?

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.279
Yeah.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.480
So does Zeng Jie.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.759
Actually,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.040
Zeng Jie met Liu Wei

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.079
through Bai Xiaoling.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.040
Come on.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:27.279
Shocked me too.

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:28.759
All my logic

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.000
and deductions

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.600
missed this angle.

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:35.519
What's wrong?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.399
Keep going.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.199
Truth is indeed driven by logic.

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:03.720
I'm going to grab

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.959
some snacks and coffee.

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:06.000
Want to eat here

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.839
or in the car?

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.720
In the car.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.120
I'm ready.

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:13.199
Let's go.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.240
Did you sleep well?

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:17.519
Absolutely.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.279
This place makes me

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:20.639
feel incredibly relaxed.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.240
We'll visit

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.879
easily

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.759
accessible places.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.800
You won't be tired.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.600
Why would I get tired

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.879
in my wheelchair?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.279
I hope you don't get tired.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.399
This is what I gave you

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.639
for your first birthday

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.519
after we met.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.319
Yeah.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.160
This is

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.160
the only scarf I have.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.079
After we return,

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.360
I'll buy you another one.

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:49.720
A great artist

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.439
shouldn't have just one scarf.

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:53.120
I rarely wear scarves anyway.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.879
One is enough.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.600
And you

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.352
gave me this before we got married.

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:57.279
It's special.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.720
Keep going.

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:00.639
Let me get closer to the river.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:09.519
I'll do it.

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:18.040
Tell me if you

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:18.600
want to

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:19.560
eat and go back.

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:21.439
I'm not tired.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:22.879
Are you tired?

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.639
No at all.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.680
Nice spot.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.839
Let's take some photos.

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:57.759
You haven't used

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.040
this camera in ages.

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:00.920
You never liked taking photos

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.000
with your phone.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.199
Phones lack

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600
depth of field.

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:11.240
How about firewood chicken

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.720
for dinner?

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:12.839
There's a nice place

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.120
not far from our hotel.

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:16.199
Let's just order room service.

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:18.040
You must be exhausted.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:19.879
We finally got this trip away.

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:22.879
You can have some drinks tonight.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.360
So quickly?

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.160
I'm celebrating.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:06.920
Another one?

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:09.560
Come on, third glass.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.639
Quick question.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.160
Who is Chen Yuhe?

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:35.120
She's my colleague,

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:37.399
Dean Chen's daughter.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.720
You've met her.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:41.480
At the anniversary banquet

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:42.679
of the university,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.759
didn't she

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:44.600
say hi to you?

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.848
How long have you been with her?

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:49.639
She's just a colleague.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.039
Just be honest.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.279
Was it before

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:55.320
or after my accident?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.960
Zeng Jie, don't be shy.

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:00.279
You've done

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:01.480
plenty of shameless things.

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:03.200
I'm asking directly

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.480
because I've verified it.

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:09.639
She's just a colleague,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.039
Dean Chen's daughter.

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:14.480
Why are you dating Chen Yuhe?

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.080
Because she's young?

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.039
Or because

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.320
her dad is your superior?

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.639
How can your superior bear to let

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:21.799
his daughter

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.639
have an affair

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.879
with a married man?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.639
Are you planning to divorce me

00:09:25.759 --> 00:09:26.960
to be with her?

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.919
Nonsense.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.759
How could I do that?

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:34.039
Why not?

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:35.799
You only married me

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.639
for my money, didn't you?

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.639
Yet you put on this act,

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:41.519
pretending to be some artist,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.200
and offered to sign

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.960
a prenuptial agreement

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.240
to convince me

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.240
that you don't care

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.360
about my dad's wealth.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:53.840
You're drunk.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.039
Three beers won't make anyone drunk.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.960
Zeng Jie, admit it.

00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.120
You've been

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.320
systematically draining

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.240
my family's assets.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.039
You're quite something.

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:04.519
Someone's

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:06.240
been coaching you, huh?

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:07.440
This is ridiculous.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.159
What's ridiculous about it?

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:10.480
That person

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.559
was Ms. Juan, wasn't it?

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:17.320
You remember Ms. Juan, don't you?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.080
Is she also

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.080
your "colleague"?

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.240
Zeng Jie.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.759
I never imagined

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.080
that my husband

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:26.000
actually dated a wealthy older woman.

00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:27.879
You've been

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.759
sponging off others since way back.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:30.879
Bai Xiaoling.

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:31.559
Watch your mouth

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.080
when you speak to me.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.519
Ms. Juan was just

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:35.320
a client of mine.

00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:36.720
She once bought

00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:37.879
my paintings

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:39.080
and helped me during

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.080
my hardest times.

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:40.840
We're just...

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.159
I know what's between you

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.600
as well as you do.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.440
She gave you money,

00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:48.840
took you to Japan for stomach treatment,

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.000
and taught you how to manipulate me.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.919
Zeng Jie, stop dodging.

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:54.519
If you'd just admit your past,

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:56.039
I might respect your honesty.

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:57.320
Besides,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.919
not every man gets to

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.000
live off an older woman's money.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.480
Bai Xiaoling.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.840
What do you want?

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:06.519
Nothing.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.279
I'm in a wheelchair.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.120
What can I do?

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.879
Then why did you

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:11.039
say that stuff?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.480
I just want to know

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.039
what I mean to you now.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.720
Will I end up like Lin Fang?

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:24.840
She died right in front of you,
didn't she?

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.480
Relax.

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:33.679
Even Lin Shan doesn't consider you

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:35.000
the murderer.

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:36.320
Why would I?

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:38.799
Zeng Jie.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.720
I know you don't

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.480
want to continue this marriage.

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:45.200
You can't tolerate blemish flaws.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.240
How could you endure

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.639
an imperfect marriage?

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.240
I've become the glaring blemish flaw

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.639
in your "perfect" life.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.240
"Near-perfect".

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:56.919
What you want

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.120
is a life nearing perfection.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.279
Bai Xiaoling.

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:12.639
Just say it.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.960
What do you want?

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.840
I want you dead.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.480
So?

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:40.120
Everything cool?

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.919
Undercurrents swirling.

00:12:42.879 --> 00:12:43.639
You're staying in

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:45.000
a two-thousand-yuan hotel room

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.440
and soaking in a bath.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.080
(Li De)
You don't

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.000
sound so nervous.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.960
Zhang Ye is covering the expenses.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:50.519
I'd never

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:51.600
splurge like this.

00:12:51.759 --> 00:12:52.240
You found

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.639
Zeng Jie and Bai Xiaoling?

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.720
Obviously.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.120
I came at dawn.

00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:57.279
I'd feel humiliated

00:12:57.399 --> 00:12:58.720
if I couldn't find them.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.200
They're staying at

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.320
the first hotel

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.120
I suspected.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:02.879
Alright.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.960
You're brilliant.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.080
This morning,

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:06.279
I checked this parking lot

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.320
but didn't find

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:08.720
Zeng Jie's car.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.919
There weren't

00:13:09.919 --> 00:13:10.720
many cars.

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.080
Most tourists had

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.039
already driven out.

00:13:14.144 --> 00:13:16.399
I brought some things
for my sister and brother-in-law.

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:17.919
They said they wouldn't be back

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
until evening.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.360
Your sister is...

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.159
The one in the wheelchair.

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:23.679
Yeah, right.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.480
They just left

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.399
half an hour ago.

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:26.840
Your brother-in-law was driving.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.440
Got it. Thanks.

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:28.240
No problem.

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:32.159
Did they mention whether they were going

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.159
to the mountains

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.279
or to the riverside?

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.000
(They went to the riverside first.)

00:13:36.559 --> 00:13:37.312
(I stayed back.)

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.600
(They didn't seem to talk much.)

00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:40.919
(About 40 minutes later,)

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.784
(Zeng Jie wheeled Bai Xiaoling away.)

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:44.360
I followed quietly.

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:45.600
They were driving

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:46.960
quite slowly.

00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:49.559
(I suspect that Zeng Jie was planning)

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:50.799
(a car accident.)

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.480
(But surveillance cameras)

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.279
(are everywhere.)

00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:54.200
(Plus, he might)

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.440
(injure himself.)

00:13:55.679 --> 00:13:56.960
(So he wouldn't be so bold.)

00:13:57.639 --> 00:13:58.960
They went to a restaurant.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.039
I hid in my car

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.480
and had a bread.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.200
That restaurant was decent.

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:04.159
I bet Zeng Jie

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.039
looked it up

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.240
beforehand.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.600
What are you eating?

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.360
Canteen food.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.879
On duty today.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:12.799
Keep going.

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:13.720
Where did they go

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:14.399
after food?

00:14:15.799 --> 00:14:16.720
Here's the crazy part.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.840
Zeng Jie took

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:18.840
Bai Xiaoling hiking.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:21.759
What?

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.320
With a wheelchair?

00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:25.399
They took the cable car up.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.720
(Then they walked)

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.960
(somewhere with)

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.080
(wheelchair access.)

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:30.960
(He even took her)

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.080
(some photos.)

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:33.799
(He's got a fancy camera,)

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.120
(probably expensive.)

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.480
He's an artist, after all.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:38.600
Please.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.159
He makes ceramics.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.639
He's not a photographer.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.919
I'd be surprised if he

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.879
knows focal lengths.

00:14:44.559 --> 00:14:45.240
(They stayed)

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.399
(for quite a while.)

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:47.440
(I suspect)

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:48.799
(he wanted to stage an accident)

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:50.144
(to make Bai Xiaoling fall.)

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.799
(Luckily, with so many tourists)

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.159
(around them,)

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.480
(he couldn't act openly.)

00:14:58.639 --> 00:14:59.360
Your imagination's

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:00.639
running wild, isn't it?

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.159
You automatically assume

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.279
he's plotting murder?

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.399
I came here because

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:05.200
he might hurt

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.120
Bai Xiaoling.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.279
Unbelievable.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:08.919
Keep working.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.039
I need to report

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.519
today's surveillance details

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:13.120
to my sponsor.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.279
He chickened out?

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:16.399
Don't you think

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:17.600
he killed Lin Fang?

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.600
Of course I do.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.159
And now he chickened out?

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.080
It's different.

00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:22.679
He had nothing

00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:23.759
to lose.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.759
He'd risk

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.159
anything.

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:27.440
But now,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.759
he's rich and famous.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.759
So he hesitates.

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:32.039
Then why did he bring her

00:15:32.159 --> 00:15:32.799
on this trip?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.360
You think he wants to fix

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:35.519
their relationship?

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.480
I'll keep trailing them.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.679
If he plans to

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:39.679
kill her,

00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:40.919
he won't chicken out.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.480
Most places they visited

00:15:42.799 --> 00:15:43.919
are perfect spots to stage

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:44.799
accidents.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.480
I believe he will keep

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:48.080
taking her to similar spots

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.200
in the next two days.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.639
Watch him closely.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.559
But I can't get too close.

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:54.159
I'll send someone there.

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:55.200
Alright.

00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:56.720
I'll send them

00:15:56.759 --> 00:15:57.600
tomorrow morning.

00:16:18.368 --> 00:16:20.889
(Alarm 06:30 AM)

00:16:20.889 --> 00:16:21.478
(In 7 hours 34 minutes)

00:16:56.032 --> 00:16:59.151
(Public Security)

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.319
Urge them.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.079
Got it.

00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:18.680
What's wrong?

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.759
What happened?

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.039
Sorry, sir.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.240
A minor issue occurred.

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:23.119
Seriously?

00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:24.160
It's clearly not

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:24.799
minor.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.000
Just a routine

00:17:26.279 --> 00:17:27.160
police check.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:27.960
Stop lying.

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:29.240
I know the tenants.

00:17:29.279 --> 00:17:30.119
- Let me in.
- Sir.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:30.720
Sir.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.319
Are you with them?

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.200
Yeah.

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:34.240
What exactly

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:34.839
happened?

00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:35.720
Your name?

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.240
Yang Zhenghui.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.519
How do you know them?

00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:40.720
Well,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.240
I'm

00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:42.240
Bai Xiaoling's friend.

00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:43.960
Is Bai Xiaoling okay?

00:17:44.079 --> 00:17:45.359
Did Zeng Jie hurt her?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.480
Sir,

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.720
please get changed.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.160
We'll talk downstairs.

00:17:55.319 --> 00:17:56.599
What happened in there?

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:00.279
Hello.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:01.880
What happened?

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.680
Did you see her?

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.480
Y-You...

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.599
I-I'll head over now.

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:08.720
Listen.

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:10.279
Send me the address

00:18:10.359 --> 00:18:10.960
of the police

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.480
station.

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:12.039
Alright?

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.160
Wherever you go,

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:14.200
send me your location.

00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:14.759
Alright?

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:15.936
I'll be there in an hour.

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:18.920
Hurry up.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.440
Well,

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.240
sorry, honey.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.359
I have to go.

00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:25.160
What's your problem?

00:18:25.599 --> 00:18:26.279
Freeze.

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:27.960
Behave.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.240
Hello? What's wrong?

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:32.720
(BBQ)
Calm down.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.760
I'll be right there.

00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:36.599
O-Officer,

00:18:36.759 --> 00:18:37.440
can you tell me

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.039
how my friend

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:38.839
is doing?

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.240
You said

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.039
you were

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:42.880
her friend.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.160
But those two

00:18:45.279 --> 00:18:45.920
are married.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.839
So what's...

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.000
I-I'm Bai Xiaoling's friend.

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:50.720
Things are complicated

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.119
between her and Zeng Jie.

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:53.240
To be precise,

00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:54.359
I believe Zeng Jie

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.640
planned this trip

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.599
to kill Bai Xiaoling.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:57.839
I followed them

00:18:58.039 --> 00:18:59.319
to prevent any accidents.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.720
But I failed to stop him.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.319
Officer,

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.000
please tell me

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.799
how Bai Xiaoling is doing.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.200
She's at the hospital.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.559
(So you're saying that)

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:13.279
(you followed her here)

00:19:14.079 --> 00:19:16.440
(because Zeng Jie might attack her?)

00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:19.039
He already did it.

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:20.119
I didn't expect

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:21.039
that piece of trash

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:21.920
would dare to

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.839
hurt her in a hotel room.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.759
Calm down.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.640
Captain Wang.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.759
He's from the Caorong Branch.

00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:32.160
Criminal Police Team 1.

00:19:32.599 --> 00:19:33.079
I'm Li De.

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:33.960
Wang Yuefeng.

00:19:34.319 --> 00:19:36.448
Captain of Criminal Police Team 2
of Qingcheng Branch.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.696
Nice to meet you.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.279
Captain Wang.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:40.799
I'm here

00:19:40.839 --> 00:19:41.680
for this case.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.160
I've been working on it

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.240
for quite a while.

00:19:44.839 --> 00:19:45.880
Please transfer the case

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.599
to the Caorong

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:47.960
jurisdiction.

00:19:48.599 --> 00:19:49.400
I figured

00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:50.759
this is why you came.

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:52.799
The case happened in our jurisdiction.

00:19:53.079 --> 00:19:54.200
By protocol,

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.640
it should be our case.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.480
You need to apply

00:19:57.759 --> 00:19:58.960
for a joint investigation

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:00.039
from superiors.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.319
You can't just take it over.

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:04.519
Yeah, I know the rules.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.480
Li De.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.000
Alright, I'll handle

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:19.839
the application.

00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:21.279
You've been

00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:22.200
working on it.

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:24.000
So, let's join hands.

00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:27.799
You know me?

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.240
This badge number

00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:33.559
was your dad's, right?

00:20:35.599 --> 00:20:36.440
You know my dad?

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.279
No.

00:20:38.599 --> 00:20:39.960
But your brother

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.079
was my college roommate.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.400
510110.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.839
He carved it on the wall.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.039
Four years.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.200
I memorized it from seeing it.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.559
You don't look like him much, but you

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:56.480
remind me of him.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.448
Back to the case.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.680
Officers.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.960
C-Can I join

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.160
the discussion?

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:28.079
Where's the ambulance?

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.279
You brought me back to Caorong?

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.480
Yeah.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.680
You lost consciousness
at the crime scene.

00:21:54.759 --> 00:21:56.559
We transferred you back overnight.

00:21:57.119 --> 00:21:58.119
Your lawyer

00:21:58.279 --> 00:21:59.240
insisted on your return

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.359
for treatment.

00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:02.519
My lawyer?

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.200
Zhang Ye?

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.359
Do you have other lawyers?

00:22:10.279 --> 00:22:11.279
Bai Xiaoling.

00:22:12.839 --> 00:22:13.640
Where's Zeng Jie?

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.160
According to medical reports,

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.240
there are

00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:23.640
no injuries to your head.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:24.920
Therefore,

00:22:25.599 --> 00:22:26.960
you remember everything

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.880
that happened, don't you?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.160
Clear as daylight.

00:22:35.559 --> 00:22:36.720
Do you have questions

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.599
or should I give my statement?

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.640
Start with your account.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.640
Zeng Jie is my husband.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.079
We decided

00:22:46.079 --> 00:22:48.119
to go on a trip some time ago.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.480
You can see what I'm like.

00:22:51.359 --> 00:22:52.559
So the itinerary

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.920
was arranged by Zeng Jie.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.680
(We drove there.)

00:22:55.759 --> 00:22:56.880
(He booked hotels)

00:22:57.079 --> 00:22:58.640
(and planned the itinerary.)

00:22:59.279 --> 00:23:00.440
(Being wheelchair-bound,)

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.720
(I hadn't gone out for ages.)

00:23:03.119 --> 00:23:04.319
(So I was thrilled.)

00:23:04.839 --> 00:23:06.279
(But while we were driving)

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.160
(around Mount Qingcheng,)

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.119
(I started feeling
that something was off.)

00:23:10.599 --> 00:23:11.559
Be more specific.

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:14.599
Actually, days earlier,

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.359
my friends advised me not to go.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.279
They suspected that

00:23:19.279 --> 00:23:20.359
Zeng Jie might hurt me.

00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:22.119
Who are your friends?

00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:24.359
A video content creator

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:25.640
named Big Hui.

00:23:26.359 --> 00:23:27.799
You said "they".

00:23:28.079 --> 00:23:29.440
Who else?

00:23:29.599 --> 00:23:30.359
Zhang Ye.

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:32.359
Big Hui and Zhang Ye

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.640
were investigating Zeng Jie

00:23:33.839 --> 00:23:35.440
and uncovered some of his secrets.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.680
They concluded

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.279
that if I went on this trip,

00:23:39.799 --> 00:23:41.000
I'd be in danger.

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:48.839
Tell us about the trip first.

00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:50.799
When did you start

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:51.599
feeling uneasy?

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.319
My marriage was going through

00:23:54.359 --> 00:23:55.759
some difficulties.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.880
I thought

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.960
he wanted to mend our relationship.

00:24:01.119 --> 00:24:02.480
But yesterday morning,

00:24:03.119 --> 00:24:04.559
he took me to the riverside.

00:24:06.079 --> 00:24:06.920
I suddenly felt

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.200
that he was trying to push me

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.000
into the river

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:10.440
to stage an accident.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.599
I'll do it.

00:24:17.119 --> 00:24:19.039
What specific actions did he take

00:24:19.119 --> 00:24:20.400
that made you feel this way?

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.400
He chose a steep path and pushed me

00:24:24.279 --> 00:24:26.480
dangerously close to the riverbank.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.880
I was too scared

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.119
to speak up

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.000
and only said comforting words.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.720
This is what I gave you

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.160
for your first birthday

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:36.960
after we met.

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:37.839
Yeah.

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:39.519
This is my only scarf.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.519
After we return,

00:24:41.599 --> 00:24:42.799
I'll buy you another one.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.400
A great artist

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.240
shouldn't have just one scarf.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.400
You gave me this before we were married.

00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:49.920
It's special.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.480
(Fortunately,)

00:24:51.799 --> 00:24:53.440
(there were many tourists nearby)

00:24:53.839 --> 00:24:54.839
(taking photos)

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.920
(close to us.)

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.079
(After a while,)

00:24:58.799 --> 00:24:59.759
(I pretended)

00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:00.880
(to feel cold and left.)

00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:03.319
After lunch,

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.799
he took me up the mountain.

00:25:06.079 --> 00:25:07.880
There was a cliff section

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:10.640
(where he insisted on taking photos)

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.119
(and pushed me)

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.359
(dangerously close to the edge.)

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.960
Take more photos of me.

00:25:28.359 --> 00:25:29.119
Sure.

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:31.279
When descending,

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.680
my hands were trembling.

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:34.720
Still, I said nothing.

00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:37.400
On the way back,

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.599
I finally realized

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:39.759
that Zeng Jie

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.960
didn't come to fix our relationship.

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:44.200
He probably wanted me

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:46.240
to vanish completely from his life.

00:25:46.839 --> 00:25:48.000
What's simpler than

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.359
staging an accident?

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:53.240
I realized

00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:55.279
that he'd keep trying

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.799
to kill me

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.960
the next day.

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:00.799
So I argued with him

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.880
in the hotel room.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.319
About what?

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.319
I'm disabled.

00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:10.160
You think Zeng Jie has been

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.519
loyal to our marriage?

00:26:11.559 --> 00:26:12.599
If I die,

00:26:12.839 --> 00:26:14.440
he'd live a better life.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.799
Why don't you get divorced?

00:26:19.359 --> 00:26:20.880
As an artist,

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.960
abandoning his wife

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.319
would damage his reputation.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.319
An accidental death suits him best.

00:26:26.839 --> 00:26:29.319
He might even create a mourning piece

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.759
for his late wife,

00:26:31.559 --> 00:26:32.279
crafting a persona

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.079
of a devoted grieving widower.

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:36.359
Did you say that

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.000
during the argument?

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:40.519
I just told him

00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:41.799
I knew all about

00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:43.200
his dirty secrets.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.440
I wanted us

00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:45.599
to stop this drama

00:26:45.599 --> 00:26:46.680
and properly say goodbye.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.279
Quick question.

00:26:52.039 --> 00:26:53.319
Who is Chen Yuhe?

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.960
You remember Ms. Juan, don't you?

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:58.799
She is also

00:26:58.799 --> 00:26:59.920
your "colleague"?

00:27:00.319 --> 00:27:01.240
Zeng Jie.

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:02.480
I never imagined

00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:04.319
that my husband

00:27:04.599 --> 00:27:06.519
actually dated a wealthy older woman.

00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:08.119
You've been

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.079
sponging off others since way back.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.519
He flew into a rage

00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:15.759
and started arguing with me.

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:18.319
Then he grabbed the knife

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:19.519
and swung it at me.

00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:20.559
Bai Xiaoling!

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:21.359
Let's end this

00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:22.039
right here.

00:27:22.039 --> 00:27:22.720
How dare you

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.880
point a knife at me?

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.640
(I blocked it,)

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.720
(and my arm got sliced.)

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.359
(He charged at me.)

00:27:30.119 --> 00:27:31.680
(He seemed to trip over)

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.559
(the dining table.)

00:27:33.559 --> 00:27:35.720
(He stabbed my shoulder,
and the knife fell.)

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.079
(It landed beside me.)

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.759
(I was terrified.)

00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:47.200
(I grabbed the knife)

00:27:48.039 --> 00:27:49.319
(and swung at him.)

00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:56.079
(I think I stabbed him.)

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.759
I think I stabbed him.

00:28:04.599 --> 00:28:05.519
How many times?

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.079
Two or three times.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:07.920
Or four times.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.200
It was a mess. I can't remember.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.200
Where is Zeng Jie?

00:28:21.119 --> 00:28:21.960
Where did you find

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.160
the knife?

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:25.920
It's the fruit knife from home.

00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:27.359
You use such a dangerous

00:28:27.359 --> 00:28:28.000
fruit knife?

00:28:28.319 --> 00:28:29.799
Zeng Jie bought it years ago

00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:30.920
during an overseas trip.

00:28:31.839 --> 00:28:32.960
Being an artist,

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.400
he often buys

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.119
unusual items.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.519
(That knife worked well.)

00:28:39.319 --> 00:28:40.759
(I use it a lot at home.)

00:28:42.759 --> 00:28:44.519
(You brought a knife on your trip?)

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:46.559
(Zeng Jie packed it.)

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.480
I found it strange at first,

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:53.039
but he said hotel knives are dirty.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:03.960
Officer.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240
How is

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:11.440
Zeng Jie doing?

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.119
Is he...

00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:03.119
Jie.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.079
I wish you had a child.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.559
That woman

00:31:07.759 --> 00:31:09.079
isn't wife material.

00:31:09.839 --> 00:31:11.119
(Zeng Qiang's Grave)
Divorce her.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.839
Find another girl.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.720
Have a child.

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:16.400
I can look after your kid

00:31:16.599 --> 00:31:18.079
for a few years.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.720
Remember.

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:27.559
You don't even care about your dad.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.759
What do you care about?

00:31:29.119 --> 00:31:31.039
Nothing can stop you.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.960
Success requires

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.319
step-by-step effort.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.680
It's okay.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.759
Everything will pass.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.519
Things

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.960
will get better.

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:09.920
I failed Xiaofang.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.720
Sorry.

00:32:10.759 --> 00:32:12.519
She was my only sister.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.559
No bride price. Fine.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.640
But it's only been a year.

00:32:16.839 --> 00:32:18.359
I hoped you'd give her

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.559
a better life.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:21.960
Professor Zeng,

00:32:22.759 --> 00:32:24.240
thank you for helping me,

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.359
and for all your encouragement.

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:28.519
Having someone

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:30.160
as exceptional as you by my side

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.880
motivated me to work harder.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.000
But

00:32:36.039 --> 00:32:37.400
right now,

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.640
I can't commit to anyone.

00:32:42.319 --> 00:32:44.160
If I could walk in there,

00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:44.960
burn away

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.240
all the bad memories,

00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:48.319
and emerge extraordinary,

00:32:49.839 --> 00:32:50.640
that'd be great.

00:32:53.599 --> 00:32:55.319
You've had such a hard life.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.400
Professor Zeng.

00:32:56.759 --> 00:32:57.640
But luckily,

00:32:57.839 --> 00:32:59.640
I can offer you comfort.

00:33:00.079 --> 00:33:00.799
However,

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.720
although I truly like you,

00:33:04.519 --> 00:33:05.559
I won't

00:33:06.759 --> 00:33:08.200
dedicate my entire youth

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:09.279
to you.

00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:13.440
Zeng Jie.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.000
I've never been

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.440
deceived and betrayed

00:33:18.359 --> 00:33:20.599
like this before.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.720
I've never

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.839
hated someone this much.

00:33:29.599 --> 00:33:31.039
That was my first time drinking.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.400
I was drunk in minutes.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.519
The room was full of

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:38.200
messy easels everywhere

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.559
and canvases filled with crooked lines.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.839
Yet I watched those

00:33:44.559 --> 00:33:45.799
clumsy brushstrokes

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.400
gradually

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.480
come alive.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.456
Transforming into clouds.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.799
Clouds colliding with wind.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.680
Wind bringing down rain.

00:33:55.559 --> 00:33:56.640
Rain swelling into floods.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.880
Harmony blending light with dust.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.000
Dust blinding my vision.

00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:08.119
Vision blurred by arrogance.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.159
Vision blurred by arrogance.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:28.719
Vision blurred by arrogance.

00:34:58.112 --> 00:35:00.128
Frost cracking open...

00:35:01.792 --> 00:35:04.000
Heavens establishing new forms.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.456
Forms coexisting in harmony.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.376
Criminal Police, Caorong Branch.

00:35:13.376 --> 00:35:15.840
I'm Bai Xiaoling's friend.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.216
Is Bai Xiaoling okay?

00:35:17.216 --> 00:35:18.624
Did Yang Zhenghui hurt her?

00:35:20.326 --> 00:35:21.760
"Yang Zhenghui"...

00:35:22.496 --> 00:35:24.480
There are 131 hotels, guesthouses,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.320
and occasional accommodations
for tourists on Mount Qingcheng.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.800
Exclude the ones

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.648
under 500 yuan per night...

00:35:31.648 --> 00:35:32.192
Action.

under 500 yuan per night,

00:35:39.456 --> 00:35:40.546
without suites,

00:35:40.546 --> 00:35:41.984
not wheelchair accessible...

00:35:43.603 --> 00:35:44.467
Again.

He could stay in Caorong.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.144
What's it called?

00:35:54.144 --> 00:35:55.904
Caorong.

00:35:56.864 --> 00:35:57.662
Alright.

00:35:57.984 --> 00:35:59.520
I bought 10 Americanos.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.624
The cheapest is 16 yuan.

00:36:03.988 --> 00:36:07.296
I couldn't even spare
16 yuan for myself before.

00:36:09.184 --> 00:36:09.792
Sorry.

00:36:11.936 --> 00:36:13.984
Tell Bai Xiaoling not to travel.

00:36:13.984 --> 00:36:14.784
She listens to you.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.696
She listens to me?

00:36:18.624 --> 00:36:20.352
If she ever listened to me,

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.168
she would've divorced before the crash.

00:36:23.168 --> 00:36:24.192
If she listened to me,

00:36:24.992 --> 00:36:27.328
she'd never have married Zeng Jie.

Professor Zeng.

No one else would listen...

00:36:40.168 --> 00:36:40.960
Sorry.

00:36:41.056 --> 00:36:42.048
What was it again?

00:36:42.752 --> 00:36:44.032
To stop this drama.

00:36:44.032 --> 00:36:45.952
I just want us...

00:36:46.944 --> 00:36:47.776
I just told him

00:36:47.776 --> 00:36:48.928
I knew...

00:36:50.112 --> 00:36:51.264
Nice spot.

00:36:51.264 --> 00:36:52.544
Let's take some photos.

00:36:56.256 --> 00:36:56.832
Sorry.

00:36:58.368 --> 00:37:00.896
This is my only scarf.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.376
I'll buy you another after we return.
