00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.440
(Episode 104)

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.610
Don't tell me...

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.340
you are stalling on purpose.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.050
Come on.
We're going to Chairman Min's hospital.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.350
I'm so sorry.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.280
I was just about to call you.
I was tricked...

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.390
into going all the way
to my mother's nursing home.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.720
- So you have no idea who stopped by?
- No, I don't.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.860
So the chairman was here
until you left, right?

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.900
That's right.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.700
Can we check the security cameras
outside his room?

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.800
As you know, this is a VIP room.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.970
We don't have them.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.970
What about at the nurses' station
or in the lobby?

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.380
The VIP ward has its own elevator
that connects to the underground garage,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.810
so you don't have to go
through the station or lobby.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.750
It's not your fault.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.620
I have a pretty good idea
who's behind this anyway.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.690
What do we do now? We should head
straight to the company, right?

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.690
We have to.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.660
I said, don't look at me like that.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.970
You don't really think I'd harm you,
do you?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.870
So why would you give your entire stake
and my CEO position...

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.770
to that woman?

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.570
Does that make any sense?

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.340
Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.280
Snap out of it.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.250
You may have founded Mingang,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.880
but I'm the one who grew it. I told you.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.450
Realize that your blood, sweat, and tears
aren't the only thing in Mingang today.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.400
- Yes, it's me.
- You moved the chairman, right?

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.600
Of course.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.000
I did just as you said, so don't worry.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.100
Good. Leave Lawyer Kim in charge there...

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.470
and come see me for a minute.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.110
I'll be right there.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.840
Stay here.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.140
Where are you off to?

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.610
I have a quick errand to run.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.250
Just lie there like a corpse
and think long and hard...

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.690
about what you did
to end up in this state.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.360
If you think hard enough,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.890
it'll come to you.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.750
You're Tae Joo, right?

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.020
Thanks for your help earlier.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.120
I couldn't have lured the nurse away
without you.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.520
Mother asked me to do it. It was nothing.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.690
From now on,
think of me as your older sister.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.860
My older sister?

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.000
That's right.
I hear you call my mother "Mother."

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.270
Then you should have no problem
treating me as your "sister."

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.540
I guess so, but it's still...

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.140
I'm sure you treated Lucia as "sister."

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.010
So do the same with me.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.640
Because from now on,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.380
I'm on your side, Tae Joo. Not Lucia.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.660
What is this?

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.960
The chairman and Lucia's divorce papers.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.730
(Application for Uncontested Divorce)

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.670
Get their signatures, no matter what.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.140
The chairman is as good as dead,
so getting his signature will be easy.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.180
The problem is Lucia.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.710
There's no way
she'll sign these willingly.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.950
That's why
you have to figure it out yourself.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.920
I've prepared the entire meal
and set the table for you.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.620
The least you can do is feed yourself.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.030
I know what I have to do.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.300
(Mingang Distribution)

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.070
She must have moved him
and is now sticking by his side.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.110
The person you called is unavailable.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.080
She's not picking up.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.450
They must have done this together.
I bet they're still together now.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.320
But why on earth would they
go to such extremes...

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.220
to move a helpless man?

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.760
That must be because they can't stand
to see you by the chairman's side.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.300
And it's a precaution in case
Chairman Min Doo Sik ever wakes up.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.300
But to uproot a paralyzed patient
from the hospital over that?

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.200
This has Madam Jang written all over it.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.300
No one else could've come up with this,
let alone pull it off.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.770
She deliberately lured us out to buy time.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.210
Why are they going to such lengths?

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.580
This is unforgivable.
I can't take it anymore.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.550
Even if Se Ri is her granddaughter,
how could she go this far?

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.980
- This is crossing the line.
- Calm down, Tae Kyung.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.690
We can deal with her later.
Right now, we need a plan.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.390
What if Chairman Min starts to talk
and tells someone about you?

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.430
Even if my identity is exposed,
is there anything we can do?

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.530
It's not like we can just shut him up.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.300
There is one thing.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.240
Opening the locked drawer
in the chairman's office.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.360
How's Father?

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:53.830
The same as always.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.690
What's this?

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.140
- Are these divorce papers?
- For Chairman Min Doo Sik and Jung Lucia.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.040
It's a mutual divorce agreement.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.050
Director Oh, what brings you here?

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.790
It's just that...

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.130
I'm so on edge that
I can't get any work done.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.300
What are you so worried about?

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.270
It's about what happened
at the last shareholders' meeting.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.100
You promised all your shares
to the acting chairman back then.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.200
That's when things went south.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.270
It was the best choice at the time.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.080
What's next? What are you going to do now?

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.350
I'll do whatever it takes to survive.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.650
If I survive, you survive too.
Isn't that how it is, Director Oh?

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.780
That's true.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.250
Who would've thought
CEO Min would make a comeback like that?

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.460
I shouldn't have gotten
on her bad side over the stake.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.460
I'm regretting it more than you know,
so let's just drop it.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.100
Right.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.430
Well...

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.600
Anyway,

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.300
you mentioned last time
that you had something...

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.540
that you could use to pressure CEO Min.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.580
Didn't you say something was going on
between Ms. Se Ri and CEO Min?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.580
It's not the right time to play that card.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.580
You're not actually thinking
of forcing him to sign this, are you?

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.520
Why not?

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.420
Don't you realize this could be
a legal problem later on?

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.090
That's a problem for later.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.730
Besides, by the time it's a legal issue,
it'll all be over, so don't worry.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.130
CEO Min.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.930
Lawyer Kim, just be quiet
and watch what I do.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.670
Because I'm going to make them
get a divorce.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.010
After all, I'm the one
who brought that woman into Mingang.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.040
If it weren't for me,
they never would have met,

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.810
and they certainly
never would have gotten married.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.580
I have to be the one to end...

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.590
this terrible mess I made.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.860
I felt betrayed seeing Father
so smitten with her...

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.830
that he couldn't see straight
and giving away the company and his stake.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.500
I felt threatened as she used his trust
to build her own power.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.840
This is for the sake of Mingang
and my family.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.540
You snuck your half-dead father out
just to force him to sign divorce papers?

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.740
A divorce? Says who?

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.080
Over my dead body.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.680
No, I refuse!

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.760
What are you standing there for?

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.800
Why are you home so late?

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.460
Is that woman in her room?

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.970
Yes.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.340
Let's talk about this tomorrow.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.510
Where did you hide the chairman?

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.350
That's not what's important right now.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.820
The chairman has already made
his intentions clear.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.960
(Application for Uncontested Divorce)

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.390
(Petitioners: Min Doo Sik, Jung Lucia)

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.630
This was your plan all along?

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.830
You took the chairman behind my back
to force him to sign divorce papers.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.300
You think that makes the divorce official?
This is legally void.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.040
Didn't Lawyer Kim tell you that?

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.340
Whether it's legally binding or not,

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.610
all you have to do is sign.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.540
I'll take full legal responsibility.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.850
What? How can you force us to divorce?

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.820
I'm just putting things back in place.
So just do as you're told.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.880
Let's be honest, this marriage
never made any sense from the start.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.120
Us, a mother and daughter?
That's ridiculous.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.660
And you, the lady of this house?
How is that any more believable?

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.360
As if the CEO position wasn't enough,
now you're the acting chairman.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.530
That's even more ridiculous.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.160
Listen here, Lucia.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.400
Consider this...

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.440
the last courtesy I'll offer to you
as my father's woman.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.210
So I'd advise you to act accordingly.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.460
(Mingang Distribution)

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.110
I can't wait forever.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.750
As soon as you sign the divorce papers,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.980
you need to prepare
to move out of the house.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.420
Now that you're splitting up
with my father,

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.820
living in the same house with his children
would be a bit awkward, don't you think?

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.090
I'll give you some time
to find a new place,

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.260
so pack your things and get out.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.730
When the chairman fully recovers,

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.200
how are you going to deal
with all this guilt?

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.440
How can you be so reckless?

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.040
That's rich, coming from you.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:48.280
Talk about wrongdoing, you're just a guest
who started acting like you own the place.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.350
What if I refuse to leave
and hold my ground?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.620
What are you going to do then?

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.720
Then things will get ugly.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.860
You don't just have me to worry about.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.160
Madam Jang is the one
who won't stand for it.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.090
You know better...

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.430
what she's like.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.810
Did anything happen last night?
Did Min Kyung Chae say anything?

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.520
She told me to sign this.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.730
(Application for Uncontested Divorce)

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.830
Unbelievable.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.830
So this is why they hid Chairman Min.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.870
They're always more outrageous
than I can imagine.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.440
I'm at a loss for words.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.510
Just like you said,
Madam Jang must have put her up to this.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.380
Min Kyung Chae just threatened me.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.710
She said if I don't do as she says,

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.280
Madam Jang won't let it slide.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.380
If Madam Jang is pulling the strings,

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.350
using Min Kyung Chae
to find the fastest...

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.250
and most foolproof method,

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.790
then that means we're just...

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.420
playing right into her hands.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.160
We can't let them get away with this.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.230
Then what?

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.670
We'll do what we have to do.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.940
She knows us well,
but we know her just as well.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.470
If we look, I'm sure there's a way
to fight back.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.780
What's the status on the divorce papers?

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.650
She's fighting it tooth and nail.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.050
She says she'd rather die than sign,
so I don't know what to do.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.320
I expected this, but she's more resolute
than I anticipated.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.060
The moment she divorces the chairman,
she loses all legal protection.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.190
Of course she's not going to
sign it easily.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.360
She'll hang on for dear life,
waiting for Father to wake up.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.370
Then let me handle her.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.830
I'll make sure to get her signature.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.640
I'll make things so unbearable for her
that she'll have to sign it herself.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.140
You have something up your sleeve?

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.820
Why don't you just sign it
while I'm still asking nicely?

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.150
It'll be better for both of us.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.420
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.390
"Better for both of us?"

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.760
Since when have we ever been
on the same side?

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.360
Now that Madam Jang is on our side,
there's no way you can win.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.770
You know what she's capable of.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.600
And if you hope Chairman Min wakes up,
that's an even bigger pipe dream.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.270
Do you really think you can find out
where Chairman Min is?

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.880
You got lucky last time,
but that won't happen again.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.250
Before, it was just a fight between us.
But now that Madam Jang is involved,

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.550
it's a full-blown war.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.990
So I should sign it and leave the house
and the company without a fight?

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.550
That would be your best option.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.520
You know what Madam Jang is like
when it comes to Se Ri.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.290
Why would she ever take your side
against her own blood?

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.230
Who would turn against their own blood?
Would you be able to?

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.140
Baek Sul Hee.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.140
This is the last courtesy
I'll extend to you.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.310
So sign and leave with Moon Tae Kyung
while I'm still being nice.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.280
Before you're completely ruined.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.410
If you two just leave on your own,

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.420
I'll convince Min Kyung Chae
to stay out of your lives for good.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.160
How incredibly considerate of you.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.230
But there's just one problem.
I have no intention of doing that.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.530
Really?

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.830
Then I guess I'll have to
play my last card.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.800
I'll have to tell Se Ri,
who looks up to you...

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.270
and trusts you like a mother,
who you really are.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.740
How will she feel when she learns
you're the mother...

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.340
of the child who died because of her?

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.580
Are you insane?

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.220
Se Ri's just started to stabilize.
She's always been so anxious and fragile.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.380
She's only just started to get better!

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:52.290
- What if she relapses?
- So the choice is yours.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.930
I can't say for sure, but knowing Se Ri,

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.230
if she finds out that you were the mother
of the dead child,

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.060
and your true motives for acting her mom,

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.370
the betrayal will completely destroy her.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.900
She might even throw herself off a roof.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.110
You think her real mother, Min Kyung Chae,

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.540
will be okay
if something happens to Se Ri?

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.810
Then, I guess this is our chance
to find out.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.810
It's like The Judgment of Solomon,
when they threaten to cut a child in two.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.120
We'll see who gives up first,
the real mother or the fake one.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.320
You're a monster.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.360
You have until tomorrow.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.360
Have the signed divorce papers on my desk
by this time tomorrow.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.990
Got it?

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.580
What's going on?
Why did you ask me to come?

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:53.880
I figured I should thank.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.350
- Your wife sent me a gift.
- Oh, that?

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:02.090
- My wife thinks the world of you.
- So I'm going to return the favor.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.760
Return the favor?

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.030
You mean,
you're really making me the director?

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.970
We already talked about this.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.370
What, did you think I'd let you rot
as Vice Director forever?

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.070
Kyung Chae. No, I mean, CEO Min.

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.370
I am not worthy of such an honor!

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.110
So does this mean I get my own office,
a secretary, the works?

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.010
Director is just the beginning.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.980
How much higher you climb is up to you.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.320
Oh, my gosh!

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.660
My dear sister!
I swear I'll do right by you.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.960
I pledge my undying loyalty.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.530
Keep this quiet until it's official.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.430
Once I decide what to do about Soo Jung,

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.960
I'll make the personnel change right away.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:45.270
- Go on, get back to work.
- Right. I should work. Yes. Okay.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.770
One more thing, Kyung Chae.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.380
(Mingang Distribution)

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.580
I'll get going.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.350
Time to get to work!

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.760
Hey, honey. Just now,

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.030
Kyung Chae promised me
the director position!

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.730
Are you serious? Kyung Chae is
actually giving you a promotion?

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.040
My gosh!

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.500
I can't believe this is happening.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.810
I honestly thought you'd be stuck
in that position until you died.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.410
I guess if you live long enough,
you see everything.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.480
Hold on! I have to call my dad.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.850
A salaryman's life hangs by a thread.
One day, they can tell you to leave,

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.960
and you have to go
without a single complaint.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.130
That's not true for all "salad man."
Not for the owners, like our son-in-law.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.930
What makes Ji Seop any different?
He looks stuck as Vice Director for life.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.630
And it's not "salad man."
What do you think this is, a buffet?

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.370
It's salaryman.
You're like a fully-charged battery...

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.940
of pure ignorance.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.440
Anyway, our son-in-law is untouchable,
so don't worry.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.080
Then how come he almost got fired?
Besides, just having a job is no big deal.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.050
A man needs to get promoted
when the time is right.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.020
Oh, my.
If it isn't my shining star, what's up?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.360
Dad! You're not going to believe this!

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.420
Ji Seop is being promoted to director.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:18.060
What in the world are you talking about?

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.900
You're saying Ji Seop is becoming a what?

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.700
A director! He's going to be Director Min!

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.770
Are you serious?
Our son-in-law is becoming a director?

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.640
Our son-in-law is getting a promotion?
What in the world?

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.750
I thought he'd go his whole life
without a promotion, just fizzling out.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.180
Hey, why are you all up in my face?
Get back.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.220
I'll tell you everything when I'm done.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.290
- So?
- Come on, let me listen in too!

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.160
What do you think you're doing?
Trying to give Ja Kyung a sibling?

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.330
I'm on the phone with Ja Kyung. Okay?

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.730
- Wait till I'm off the phone first.
- Oh, my goodness.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.140
And what's with that pose? So crass.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.100
What? A sibling? It's nothing.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.440
Your mother is embarrassing me to death.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.480
But is it for real?

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.680
I can't say for sure, but knowing Se Ri,

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.950
if she finds out that you were the mother
of the dead child,

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.880
and your true motives for acting her mom,

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:15.920
the betrayal will completely destroy her.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.060
She might even throw herself off a roof.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.950
In my head, I know I should hate you.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.710
I hate you so much,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.820
but why does my heart ache when I see you?

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.590
I want to see you ruined,

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:52.490
so why am I so afraid that you will be?

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.060
Mom.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.600
I was just checking to see
if you were sleeping well.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.170
Sleep here with me.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.680
It's been a while since we've done this.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.680
Se Ri, do you love me that much?

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.620
I'm not even your birth mother.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.090
You may not have given birth to me,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.360
but you believe in me
more than anyone else in the world,

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.460
and you're the person I trust the most.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.930
Do you know what my biggest wish is?

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.440
If I could be reborn in my next life,

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.640
I'd want to be born as your real daughter.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.010
To spend ten months
in your belly before being born.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.000
So you're saying you're finally going
to sign the divorce papers?

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.530
If Se Ri finds out, it's all over.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.970
But you can't do this. It's not right.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.040
I can't just stand by
and watch Se Ri be ruined.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.210
Is it harder to watch her fall apart
than to fall apart yourself?

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.310
Answer me.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.350
What would it mean to you
if Se Ri fell apart?

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.290
Kim Sun Jae told me something.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.920
That if Se Ri finds out the whole truth,

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.930
like my Mi So,

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.430
she might jump from a rooftop.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.900
How could he say that to you?

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.510
That's why I have to protect her.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.040
I can't go through that again.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.680
You have no idea how painful that is.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.020
So Kim Sun Jae said he'd end it today?

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.160
The way he was bragging and telling me
to leave it to him,

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.190
it seems like he has a foolproof plan.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.730
Once Lawyer Kim Sun Jae gets Lucia
to sign the papers, what will you do?

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.170
What do you mean?

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.730
He'll be useless to us then.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:22.270
The hunt is over.
Is there a reason to keep the hound?

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.610
Why do you hate him so much?

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.380
That's because if I just let him be,

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.110
that man will end up
being our Se Ri's stepfather.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.450
And I refuse to let a man like that
be my granddaughter's adoptive father.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.570
I heard everything
from Lawyer Kim Sun Jae.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:57.610
Se Ri. Please calm down and listen to me.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.310
I wasn't deceiving you.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:04.310
- I admit I was at first, but not anymore.
- No.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:05.650
Mom!

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.320
I guess I can't call you "Mom" anymore.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.790
You used me to get revenge
for your real daughter.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.430
You were just toying with me,
pretending to be my mom.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.200
And I was a fool, looking up to you
like a real mother.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.440
Fine. I'll give you what you want.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.740
You wanted revenge for your daughter,
didn't you?

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.990
If I die just like your daughter,
does that end your revenge?

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:44.890
Then you'll finally be happy, right?

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:49.360
Fine.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:50.990
I'll die for you.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.100
I will gladly die for you!

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.810
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.220
Have you made up your mind?

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.860
A day was more than enough time.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.730
Promise me something first.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.240
Don't ever tell Se Ri who I am.
Or why I came to her in the first place.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.400
Promise me you'll keep it a secret.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.610
Fine, whatever. Just sign it.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:58.060
(Min Doo Sik, Jung Lucia)

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.540
You should've done this from the start.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:31.190
Lawyer Kim.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:36.900
What did I tell you?

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.770
I said I'd handle it, didn't I?

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:43.740
How on earth did you get her to sign?

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:45.940
You're really something else.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.150
Why call me all the way out here?
You should've just come to my office.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:52.320
To envision the future of Mingang
that we'll build together,

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.180
what better place could there be
than this?

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.720
From the highest place,
we'll dream of the brightest future.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.390
The one that Min Kyung Chae
and Kim Sun Jae will create.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.390
Our very own kingdom!

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:11.330
Yes, it's me.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.110
Did Kim Sun Jae
get the divorce papers signed?

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.510
Yes. Her signature is on it.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.220
He's good at that sort of thing, at least.
What's your next move?

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.710
What are you going to do with Lawyer Kim?

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.180
You're not actually planning to marry him,
are you?

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.350
I already told you.
That's not going to happen.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.920
Now I have to decide
whether to use him up or cast him aside.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.450
Now that hunting season's over,
we don't need the hunting dog anymore.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.880
