00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.910
(Episode 99)

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.920
Se Ri...

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.890
is really my granddaughter?

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.630
Ho Se.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.000
They're saying she's your daughter.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.100
The child Min Kyung Chae secretly had
and raised on her own...

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.940
is your flesh and blood.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.980
Ho Se.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.380
What am I supposed to do now?

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.730
Did you get the results?

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.360
I did.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.630
Can I see you now?

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.730
I'll be right there.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.710
The bad blood you created 20 years ago...

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.710
has come full circle
to become my lifeline.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.920
Madam Jang is his mother.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.290
She's the birth mother of the man
you were so dead set against.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.890
From now on,
with blood thicker than water,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.660
I'll get my hands on Mingang Distribution.
Just watch how I do it.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.560
It's one of those things that's hard
to believe, but also hard to deny.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.630
How did we meet like this?

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.540
Tell me about it.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.010
I never dreamed I'd get entangled
with you like this, Madam.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.840
I kept telling myself it couldn't be true,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.280
but I guess there's no denying it now.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.080
Are you disappointed?

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.220
I'm happy because Se Ri feels like a gift
that Ho Se left behind for us.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.060
Do you remember my Ho Se?

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.830
How could I ever forget him?

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.930
He was the first and last man in my life.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.700
I bet Kim Sun Jae
wouldn't like to hear that.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.910
That's not something you should say while
wearing another man's engagement ring.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.440
Madam, do you really think
I'm in love with Sun Jae?

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.850
Do you think I got engaged out of love?

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.720
Hey, do you know
what our Articles of Incorporation...

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.890
say about a situation like this?

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.920
The Articles of Incorporation?
What about it?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.760
With the chairman gone and CEO acting,
who gets to fill the vacant CEO position?

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.500
Beats me.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.730
They have to appoint someone.
It's the CEO spot, not a reserved seat.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.070
They can't just leave it empty.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.640
That's true. Some approvals
go through the CEO's office...

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.240
before reaching the chairman's office.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.380
Approvals? That's not all.
The online and chain store teams...

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.180
are juggling multiple projects at once.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.380
You expect them to run everything
by the chairman's office?

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.720
The chairman's staff would be swamped.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.750
The CEO is supposed to filter things...

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.720
and handle other matters
at their discretion.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.190
Reports and proposals aren't sent
directly to the chairman's office.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.660
And we can't just put
any Tom, Dick, or Harry in the seat.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.660
It has to be someone
from the owner's family.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.600
Then it's either you or me.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.940
Exactly. That's why we need to check
the Articles of Incorporation.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.270
Lawyer Kim would know best about that,
wouldn't he?

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.210
Hey, Sun Jae.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.550
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.180
Why were you looking for me?

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.150
You know
our company's Articles of Incorporation...

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.150
inside and out, right?

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.320
With the CEO position vacant like this,
who do you think should be in that seat?

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.260
Tell me what you really think.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.030
Why? You think you have a shot?

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.960
Don't get your hopes up.
That seat's already taken.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.830
- Who?
- Min Kyung Chae.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.700
She'll be coming back soon.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.880
What is he talking about? She got fired.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.750
I've always been a good judge of people.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.550
How could I have looked at Se Ri
and not been reminded of Ho Se?

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.090
You know how they say you can't see
what's right in front of you.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.060
I noticed Se Ri
didn't look like her mother,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.830
so I wondered who she took after.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.000
Who do you think she looks like, Madam?
Our Se Ri.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.400
Madam?

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.040
Me? I'm not sure.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.840
About Lucia...

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.310
How long are you planning
on keeping her around?

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.920
I told you how Lucia really feels
about our Se Ri.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.550
How Lucia's acting toward Se Ri now
is not genuine.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.390
I know it for a fact.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.590
It's a mother's intuition,
something only a mother...

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.630
who's carried a child and endured
the agony of childbirth can have.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.360
When I gave birth to our Se Ri,

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.770
I was on the verge of passing out
and never waking up.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.500
With no family by my side,
I passed out from the labor pains.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.270
And I was just left there for hours.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.410
But even now,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.180
if you ask me what the best thing
I've ever done is,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.290
I'd say it was
giving birth to our Se Ri...

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.860
and bringing Ho Se's child
into this world.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.820
Are you really not going to open
the desk drawer?

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.720
That drawer...

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.190
It could be part of
Chairman Min Doo Sik's grand scheme.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.160
I'm sure he has another safe deposit box
at his primary bank.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.400
You think he kept the will
and contracts there instead?

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.640
And then he'd slyly leave this one locked
on purpose.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.770
When you finally open it,
there's nothing inside,

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.010
but it's a brilliant way to see
who's been snooping.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.110
So it's a kind of trap?

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.710
Knowing Chairman Min Doo Sik, I'd say so.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.550
But it doesn't feel right to give up
when it's right in front of us.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.990
The moment Chairman Min wakes up,
you'll be the first person he goes after.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.960
Then maybe we should ask Madam Jang
for her opinion.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.200
Maybe ask her what she would do
in this situation.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.930
Good idea. Madam Jang...

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.100
was heartbroken
about what happened to your parents.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.840
I'm sure she'll find a way to help.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.450
Yes, it's me.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.380
I wanted to ask your advice on something.
I'll drop by later.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.290
No. Don't come. We can talk later.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.690
- I'm not feeling well today.
- What's wrong?

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.860
It's nothing.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.560
Don't worry about it.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.630
- Shouldn't you go to the hospital?
- I'm fine. Just don't come.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.800
Absolutely do not come here. All right?
You can't come here today.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.600
Yes, okay.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.240
What is it? Did the call drop?

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.780
Yes.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.280
She's being so strange today.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.420
I don't think I can see her today.
She said she's not feeling well.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.860
Really?

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.990
I wonder what's wrong with her.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.330
Was it that woman?

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.030
Yes, she wanted to come,
but I told her not to come.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.470
It just didn't feel right
for her to come over now.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.870
See?

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.970
Now that you know who your family is,
you're torn about siding with a stranger.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.040
Please, you have to help me, Mother.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.150
- "Mother?"
- As Ho Se's mother, you're my mother too.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.820
I have to get back into Mingang.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.790
I have to get the CEO position back
and kick Lucia out of the company...

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.730
and grow Mingang even bigger
so I can pass it down to our Se Ri.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.260
So what you're saying is...

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.800
you want me to betray Lucia
and take your side?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.430
It's only natural, Mother.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.470
Blood is thicker than water.
Don't you agree?

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.270
Mother, what's your favorite food?

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:54.910
Why?

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.140
Are you offering to treat me?

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.040
We should at least have a meal
together with Se Ri.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.180
With Se Ri?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.080
Yes, your granddaughter.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.350
Hearing you call her my granddaughter...

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.820
makes my heart race.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.090
Some other time.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.560
I don't think I can go out today.
I feel like I'm going to collapse.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.730
I suppose it was a shock for me too.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.900
Then please get some rest.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.970
There's no need to rush.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.270
We have all the time in the world
to spend together.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.410
I'll be on my way, then.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.800
With the chairman gone and CEO acting,
who gets to fill the vacant CEO position?

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.600
And we can't just put
any Tom, Dick, or Harry in the seat.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.500
It has to be someone
from the owner's family.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.940
If they're choosing from the owner family,
then it's obviously me.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.080
Does he really think he's a candidate?
He's completely unqualified.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.450
Come to think of it, Min Kyung Chae held
that position for way too long.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.080
Sitting in the CEO's chair,
she looked down on everyone.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.330
Who's there?

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.370
(CEO Jung Lucia)

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.410
What are you doing here again?

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:44.750
I should be asking you that.
Why aren't you with the online team?

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.920
Don't tell me you're
seriously after that position, are you?

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.390
Why?

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.020
Is there a problem if I want it?

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.090
You really have no shame, you know that?

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.500
If you wanted that seat so badly,
you should've tried harder before.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.040
How many chances did Dad give you?
You're the one who blew it every time.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.200
Why are you bringing up the past?
That was then, and this is now.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.280
We can't leave the position empty
for too long.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.880
Obviously,
I'm the right person for the job.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.450
Do I really have to spell it out for you?

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.250
The director is next in line for CEO.
Who goes from vice director to CEO?

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.250
Hey, if we're going by that logic,

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.420
there's someone
who started as a staff member,

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.820
skipped the line to become CEO overnight,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.530
and is now the acting chairman.
So give me a break.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.430
You're saying you have to be
the one to take it?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.830
That's right. Why?

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.140
Where have you been running off to?

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.570
What about the report due today?

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.910
I'm working on it, okay?

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.450
That's what you always say.
I've heard that so many times before.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.480
Gosh, you act like hounding people...

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.750
is the only way to get things done.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.520
With some people, you have to hound them
just to get them to do their work.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.990
Take it easy on me.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.660
You never know how the tables will turn.
How do you know what I'll become?

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.360
And what exactly will you become,
Vice Director?

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.000
To be blunt, I could end up
being your boss.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.240
So you'd better go easy on me now
before you live to regret it.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.740
I'm not picking on you.
It's constructive feedback.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.740
If you don't want to be penalized,
then do your job properly.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.610
Until you finish that report today,

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.410
don't even think about going home.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.520
Gosh, that guy. I swear...

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.720
You'd better get on my good side.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.190
The minute I become CEO, you're toast.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.100
Gosh, this report is a real piece of work.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.310
I worked hard on it.
Is it not to your liking?

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:50.810
You think I'd be happy with this?

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.910
I could do a better job
with my eyes closed.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.880
Listen here, Moon Tae Kyung.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.550
Do you know what they call
people like you?

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.720
You don't, do you?
They call it being a freeloader.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.320
Do it over again.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.360
From scratch.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.300
How many times have I redone this?
Why are you always picking on me?

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.170
I'm not picking on you.
It's constructive feedback.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.270
If you don't get this finished
by the end of the day,

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.100
don't even think about going home.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.970
What? Aren't you going to get to it?

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.840
Unbelievable!

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.780
How incompetent.
It's the same thing every time.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.970
So the CEO position is
in your stepmother's hands now?

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.410
Looks that way.
Normally, the board would meet,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.080
nominate a few candidates for CEO,
and vote on one,

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.110
but we're in a state of emergency
right now.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.420
So while there's an acting chairman,
they can't go through the whole process?

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.090
I don't know for how long,
but I want a turn as CEO, honey.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.290
Think of how symbolic that position is.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.160
Remember how Kyung Chae lorded it
over everyone from that position?

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.830
She treated people like they were nothing.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.800
That's true. When Kyung Chae was CEO,
she didn't even treat you like a person.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.740
Exactly! I want a turn at it too.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.340
I'll call Kyung Chae in
and just put her in her place.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.540
I'm in! I'm 100 percent behind you!

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.750
I don't care about anyone else,
but Kyung Chae has it coming.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:40.680
So now, become the queen of housewives
and... I mean,

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.190
you need to get on Stepmother's good side!

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.090
The queen of housewives?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.630
Yes. The queen of housewives!

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.660
After all, the CEO position has to go
to someone in the Min family,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
so who else is there?

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.630
Who's left but me?

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.300
Yes?

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.910
What are you so deep in thought about,
Mother?

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.180
Why? Is there something you want
to say to me?

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.310
I was just wondering
if you were free tomorrow.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.020
Tomorrow?

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.250
Well, I don't have any special plans.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:16.520
Why do you ask?

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.490
Then let's go shopping together tomorrow.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.790
We can also grab a delicious meal
at a nice place.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.260
What's this, all of a sudden?

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.700
Come on. We've never done anything
like this, just the two of us.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.970
We've been through a lot
as the Min family, haven't we?

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.340
Let's try to be closer from now on. Okay?

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.480
Please, Mother?

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.080
I suppose there's no harm
in getting along.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.290
I'll think about it.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:50.920
You may go now.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.220
Okay, Mother. Have a good night.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:01.600
What is she up to?

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.270
Honey!

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:18.880
Yes?

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.890
And what do you want?

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.290
What's with everyone tonight?

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.830
I'll get straight to the point.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.100
Give me the CEO position.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.830
And why should I do that?

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.700
When I said I'd give you my stake
before the shareholders' meeting,

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.340
what did you think that meant?

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.070
That you'd be on my side?

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.880
It didn't look that way to me.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.280
- It was like revenge on your half-sister.
- Whatever.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.020
You used my stake to end the meeting
and avert a crisis. It's a fact.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.520
This is a two-way street.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.560
So, in return,
I should make you the new CEO?

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.660
Frankly, who else is there?

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.730
You can't put my brother in charge.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.370
And it's not like my sister is coming back
as CEO either.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.510
(10 dollars)

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.780
Sir, why are you staring
at that so intensely?

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.920
Money...

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.690
I was just wondering what money really is.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.460
I always thought money was king,

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.290
but it seems money isn't everything
in life.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.830
That's not like you, sir.
What's gotten into you?

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.830
Ever since I heard my in-law is bedridden,
more dead than alive,

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.170
everything feels pointless,
and life has no meaning.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.040
Life is fleeting, and beauty doesn't last.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.040
No power lasts forever, and mutant.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.680
Or not mutant. Anyway, I have no energy.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.180
I've completely lost my appetite.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.150
I understand.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.920
I can see why you'd feel that way.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.790
There is a good remedy for that.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.590
There is?

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.090
What is it?

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.590
Tell me. I'll do exactly as you say.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.060
Usually, in these situations,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.330
people donate their entire fortune.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.640
To the poor.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.540
My entire fortune?

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.880
Yes.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.250
Everything? Every last dime?

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.450
Without leaving a single penny?

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.880
Yes.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.990
Once you give away your entire fortune,

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.790
they say you'll find
the meaning of life again.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.590
So, would you like me to look into
some charities for you?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Forget it!

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.570
What good is life's meaning if I'm broke?
I'd be starving to death!

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.340
What good would the meaning of life
be then?

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.510
You're a real piece of work, aren't you?
There's a line, and you just crossed it.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.810
My entire fortune?
Not even 20, 30, or 100 dollars...

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.880
but my entire fortune?

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:05.320
Are you trying to shake down Oh Pan Sool?
I'm not donating a single penny. Got it?

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.450
I'm taking it all with me to the grave.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.350
Besides, I'm going
to the fiery pit anyway.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.890
I'll need it to bribe
my way around down there.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.790
Don't you ever say that again!

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.430
Gosh.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.740
He's a real piece of work, you know?
There's a line you just don't cross.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.080
What's wrong?
Did someone say something outrageous?

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.610
He told me to make a donation.
My entire fortune, no less.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.250
Whoever that is,
he clearly doesn't know you at all.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.020
Pigs will fly
before Oh Pan Sool makes a donation.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.660
My point exactly! You're the only one
who really gets me, Yang Mal Sook,

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.290
but for some reason,
that's kind of insulting.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.300
Let me be honest.
Cheapskate, tightwad, miser...

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.300
You'd take home the gold medal
in that field.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.170
Shouldn't you be
in the Guinness Book of World Records?

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:02.940
When a same-age in-law collapses,
most are shocked into changing their ways,

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:06.580
but not Oh Pan Sool. You'd never change.
Once a money fiend, always a money fiend.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.810
You're not wrong.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.050
But now I feel even more insulted.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.680
Is that money fiend
the term I'm thinking of?

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.320
That's right. That's the one.
A jerk who's crazy for money.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.190
Money fiend-butt.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.230
What's the "butt" for?

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.800
Try getting head-butted
by this money-crazy jerk!

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.760
Gosh, you blockhead!

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.600
Hey, Oh Pan Sool! Get back here!

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.170
Seriously. You blockhead!

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.540
Oh, my! You money fiend!

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.510
- Gosh, my head.
- Goodness, my head.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.380
Honey!

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.680
Honey. How do I look today?

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.720
Do you think your stepmother will like it?

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.760
I was worried it might be off-putting,
so I chose something understated.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.760
To really look the part
of a daughter-in-law.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.900
It's great. Absolutely perfect.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.730
But do you think Stepmother
will shop with you?

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.470
I get the feeling she's not into that.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:08.470
Oh, please. You don't know anything.
What woman doesn't love to shop?

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.270
I'll be her shopping mate...

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.840
and sweet-talk her
into getting you the CEO position.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.250
You know that's my specialty.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.420
So don't you worry.
Just get ready to be called CEO.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.920
Being called CEO?

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.020
CEO!

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.390
Are you feeling any better?

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.200
Have you seen a doctor?

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.930
It's not that serious.
I'm just feeling a bit under the weather.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.070
It's just my age, that's all.
Don't worry about it.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.170
I'll stop by after work today.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.040
- Don't go to all that trouble.
- It's no trouble at all.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.540
Let's have dinner together.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.580
- The person you called is unavailable.
- Who's she on the phone with for so long?

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:57.820
I'm getting another call.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.260
I'll call you back.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.200
- It's me.
- "It's me?" A strange greeting, Mother.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.300
When are you going to stop
being so formal with me?

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.940
I always call you CEO Min or Ms. Min.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.340
It's a hard habit to break.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.710
Please don't. It makes me feel like
there's a wall between us.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.510
You, me, and our Se Ri are the only family
Ho Se has left in the world.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.950
I don't want us to be awkward
with each other like strangers.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.650
You have a point.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.150
So, what did you call about?

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.890
I was hoping we could
see each other today.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.930
I thought we could go shopping
and get a bite to eat...

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.230
with Se Ri.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.460
With Se Ri?

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.370
Mother!

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.870
What are you doing here?

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.910
You promised me last night.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.210
You said you'd be my shopping mate today.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.580
What are you talking about?
That wasn't a promise.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.810
I said I'd think about it.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:01.020
Oh, please. Anyway,
you don't have any meetings today.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.350
I checked with your secretary,
and you have no outside meetings either.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.600
Come on, let's go.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.870
I'm telling you, I booked a restaurant
with an amazing ambiance.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.910
(Mingang Distribution)

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.240
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.150
(Mingang Distribution)

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.860
- Here.
- Gosh, forget it.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.900
I told you to get dressed properly
and follow me.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.700
But why?
Why do I have to go meet that grandma?

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.140
Funny you should say that.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.570
Exactly. Madam Jang is like your grandma.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.240
So why not act like her granddaughter?

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.580
Let her ask
her own granddaughter to do that.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.310
Why should I have to do it for a stranger?

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.480
Because she's not a stranger to us!

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.650
What's that supposed to mean?

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.720
What do you mean she's not a stranger?

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.690
Look, people even grant a dying wish.
Can't you do this one thing for me?

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.830
Does it cost money? Is it that hard?
What's the big deal?

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.670
Because I can't stand her, okay?

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.530
Do it whether you like it or not.
It's the only way we'll survive.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.040
- Come on.
- No.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.310
- Manager Gong.
- Yes.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.110
Please get changed.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.240
What's wrong with you?

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.580
Gosh, I can't believe this!

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.560
Say something.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.190
What, did the cat get your tongue?
You haven't said a word.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:52.930
What do you want me to say?

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.100
Se Ri doesn't seem happy to see me.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.530
Should I be?

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.840
You're surprisingly unlikable,
you know that?

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.170
She just speaks her mind.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.440
It's better than walking on eggshells
around adults.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.580
I think it's because she's so carefree.
Her personality is very bright and open.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.820
Se Ri, may I hold your hand?

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.630
It's so warm.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.000
They say warm hands mean a warm heart.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Goodness.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.780
She may seem prickly on the outside,
but deep down, she's incredibly gentle.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:43.950
I'm sure she is.
You know whose daughter she is.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.820
Se Ri, would you like to go get
something good to eat with me?

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.530
Enjoy your meal, Mother.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.230
You must have been tired
from all that shopping, right?

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.440
If anyone was tired,
it must have been you.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:10.070
Seriously, how much does one have to shop
to become a Black Sapphire member?

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.180
It's nothing, really.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.980
For me, spending money is
the easiest thing in the world.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.690
All right, so what's the bottom line?

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.160
We're not even close, but you insisted
on me being your shopping mate,

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.460
and now this fancy restaurant.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.000
You must have something
you want to ask me, right?

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.270
Goodness, you're sharp.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.670
Since we're on the subject,

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.870
please make my husband the CEO.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.370
He wants it so badly...

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:46.510
that he even talks about it in his sleep.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.120
So that's what this was all for?

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.540
Wait, who's that?

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.240
Isn't that Kyung Chae and Se Ri?

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.650
But that woman with them...

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.460
Why is Madam Jang meeting
with Min Kyung Chae and Min Se Ri?

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:55.010
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:10.160
Are we that close?

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.730
Of course.
Se Ri and I are your family now.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.770
What on earth would possess Madam Jang
to meet them in private?

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.200
I'll build the Min Kyung Chae empire
with me as its sole ruler.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.070
I suppose there's no place for me, then?
And you're sure you can retake that seat?

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.010
- Madam Jang, how could you do this to me?
- Jung Lucia, you listen to me.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.550
This time, I'm going to save you.
Saving you is the only way I can live.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.780
