[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.890
[Episode 15]

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.000
How weird.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.340
This is no ordinary weapon.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.310
Or rather,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.539
this wasn't even caused

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.759
by a weapon at all.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.430
What makes you say that?

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.160
Wasn't Wei Qi

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.880
murdered by someone?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.690
If it wasn't done by a human,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.720
m-maybe it was that ghost.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Shut up!

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.120
Huo You.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.440
Lu Lingfeng.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.350
Don't tell me you believe

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.479
that thief's supernatural nonsense!

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.080
She said, "That ghost."

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.910
There was "that" before "ghost,"

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.910
which means she was referring
to something specific.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.750
Answer me.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.360
Did you see something

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.690
eerie or supernatural?

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:30.880
I did.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.020
It was in the Bai Ze Temple.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.870
Now that I think about it,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.670
it was either a demon or a ghost.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.740
That ghost was in white,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.230
with horns on its head

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.170
and two large fangs sticking out.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.740
It looked just like this clay statue.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.140
You bold thief!

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.190
Show some respect
in front of the statue of the deity!

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.850
Step back!

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.680
What was the size of that white figure?

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.110
I mean its height and build.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.550
A-About the same as a human.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.430
About the same as a human?

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.120
Have you ever seen the Bai Ze mask
with horns on its head

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.280
and fangs that people wear to ward off

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.160
evil spirits?

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.040
Yes, I have.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.280
Very similar.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.410
They look very similar.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.960
It seems
that someone's been playing tricks

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.450
to pretend to be a ghost
in the Bai Ze Temple.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.020
If that's the case,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.280
Chen He, who mysteriously disappeared,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.880
has probably been murdered.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.670
Hermit Baize!

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.550
Are there any places

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.590
in this temple that we don't know about,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.240
like hidden rooms or secret passages?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.080
No, there aren't.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.680
May I take a look at the corpse?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.870
This happened because he irritated Bai Ze,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.000
and the great deity

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.000
bit off his head!

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.900
Is it you, Great Deity Bai Ze?

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.360
What did you say?

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.890
Impossible!

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.180
Your reasoning isn't

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.750
as good as your folk storytelling.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.720
What do you mean?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.510
Since Bai Ze is an auspicious beast,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.290
how could it eat people?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.860
That being said,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.170
none of those who offend the deity

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.950
can make it out of here alive.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.180
Didn't you also say

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.150
it didn't look like a weapon wound?

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.060
That must've been
from Bai Ze's sharp teeth!

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.930
Nonsense!

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.270
Bai Ze doesn't exist in this world.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.530
Stop talking rubbish.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.460
You don't believe in gods?

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.280
Fine!

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.140
Then you can all wait

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.500
to have your heads bitten off!

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.480
You guys!

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.430
Officers,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.400
please free my wife.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.560
Don't leave her tied up here

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.360
to be bitten and killed by Bai Ze!

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.190
I confess.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.830
I stole the treasures.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.159
I was the prime culprit.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.690
My wife has already

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.930
suffered a lot.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.920
I beg you

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.550
to spare her life.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.540
Shut up!

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.100
Su Wuming,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.540
you are a master

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.890
of coroner skills.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.000
Please take another careful look.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.060
I think that hermit

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.400
has got a point.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.950
It does look like his head was bitten off

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.250
by some giant beast.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.680
Huo You!

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.159
He's scared out of his wits.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.680
Your Imperial Guards are

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.280
indeed "strong and mighty."

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.330
How dare you!

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.480
I'll kill you!

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.040
Ding!

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.140
Don't lose your composure.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.040
General Ding,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.680
you'd better go quickly

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.390
to calm Huo You down.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.870
This temple is so peculiar.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.650
From this moment on,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.210
we must be extremely cautious

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.670
and avoid acting rashly.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.430
Officers,

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.760
I'm begging you.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.370
Please release my wife.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.480
I forced her to be my accomplice.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.720
No,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.610
don't listen to him.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.230
Officers,

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.310
please free my husband.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.840
I'm the real prime culprit.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.159
Years ago, I was raped by a lustful man.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.720
After that, I made a vow

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.170
to dedicate my life
to punishing lecherous men.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.800
I'd marry whoever was

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.960
willing to lend me a hand.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.900
That was why I made him

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:51.950
my husband.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.090
Therefore,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.159
he was just following my lead.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.920
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.120
You're pregnant now.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.090
You should beg the officers

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.600
to spare your life!

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.240
You two as a couple are

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.090
quite loyal to each other,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.950
both caring about each other.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.920
You're doing much better than those

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.520
who call each other brothers

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.880
in the martial world.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.120
Is this your first time
in these mountains?

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.800
Yes,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.540
we took a wrong turn

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.680
and committed the crime by the way.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.320
Hey,

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.590
are you letting me have the chance
to do a good deed?

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.440
What are you going to do?

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.480
If you'll kill someone, kill me.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.690
My wife is pregnant!

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.870
You evil man, I'll fight you...

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.150
Although there was a reason
why you did so,

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.190
you have still committed a crime.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.510
So, you go down the mountain yourselves

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.840
and go to Yongzhou Prefecture

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.170
to confess your crimes.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.250
Go down the mountain ourselves?

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.250
Aren't you afraid

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.920
that we'll run away?

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.840
As you can see,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.910
this temple is weird and dangerous.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.150
If we keep you tied up here,

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.600
you will lose your lives,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.090
and that will be our fault.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.610
As for whether you run away or not,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.600
it's up to you.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.840
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.320
-We will definitely go turn ourselves in.
-We will definitely go turn ourselves in.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.380
No need to thank me.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.600
That gentleman just now is

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.550
the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:40.510
Lu Lingfeng.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.010
When you go to confess your crimes,

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.540
just say his name.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.480
Jiao,

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.690
remember,

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.600
you must tell them that you're pregnant

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.190
for a lighter sentence.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.060
Alright, get up.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.390
Given that you two are
so devoted to each other,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.370
I don't think you're bad by nature.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.480
After you're released,

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.810
you should behave well
to live a good life

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.970
and raise your child

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.910
properly.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.510
He said it was so weird and dangerous

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.630
that he feared we might lose our lives.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.030
But why didn't they leave?

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.740
We

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.190
ran into good officials.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.690
That's what

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.960
a good official should be like.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.300
This is just an ordinary kitchen.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.640
There's nothing suspicious about it.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.910
What are you groping for?

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.750
The stove fire is already out,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.600
but why is it so hot in here?

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.600
Is it hot?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.200
Don't you feel it?

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.520
It does feel a bit hotter than outside.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.050
The floor is hot.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.560
That roar is very close.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.840
Su Wuming,

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:31.920
hide well.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.290
There should be...

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.490
b-be a secret chamber under here. I...

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.240
Whatever beast you are,

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.230
please don't eat me. I'm skinny and small.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:58.720
I'm barely a mouthful for you.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.000
Besides, I can't use martial arts.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.100
I-I won't hurt you. I...

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.300
I need to find that secret chamber.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.640
General Ding,

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.660
let's run.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.200
If we don't leave now, we'll end up

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.800
like Wei Qi, killed by Bai Ze.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:20.520
Why panic?

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.000
Can't you hear

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.060
that loud roaring?

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.030
You've followed me for years

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.290
and been through countless battles

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.220
without fear.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.390
What's wrong with you today?

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.290
General,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.690
we've only dealt with humans before.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.270
B-But

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.080
this time, we don't even know

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.810
whether it's a beast or a ghost!

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.760
General Ding!

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.060
Let's just leave!

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.870
Look how messed up you are!

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.720
Don't bring shame on the Imperial Guards.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.270
Stand up!

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.220
General Ding,

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.890
I have a big family to support.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.290
I beg you, General Ding!

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.510
Please let me survive!

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.960
I really don't want

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.360
my head bitten off,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.260
General!

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.840
You good-for-nothing!

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.040
General Ding.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.490
Sorry for my incompetence!

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.150
Huo You!

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.700
Huo You, come back!

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.400
Where are you going?

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.200
It's you.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.360
Chen He?

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.660
Come on.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.880
Have you two ever left your room?

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:18.760
Have you seen

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.619
a weird masked person in white?

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.760
I haven't seen any weird person.

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:25.970
But ghosts are common to see here.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.400
I, Lu Lingfeng,
Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.200
order you two
to be interrogated in the courtyard.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.820
Huo You!

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:53.960
Ding Heng?

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.450
[Bai Ze Temple]

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.110
[Bai Ze Temple]

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.070
Bro...

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.510
Ding,

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:16.540
what happened?

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.470
Wei Qi died a terrible death.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.030
Chen He disappeared.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.180
Huo You was so frightened

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.890
that he wanted
to leave the temple and the mountain.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.490
I scolded him, but I didn't stop him.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.700
After a brief delay,

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.070
[Bai Ze Temple]

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.730
I was worried about his safety

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.740
and planned
to escort him down the mountain secretly.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.800
So I went after him.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.460
But as soon as I came out...

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.920
Could it really be

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.230
that Bai Ze bit off his head?

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:54.760
Absolutely not.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.680
Someone's been faking
these supernatural things.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.340
And there's

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.790
more than one person.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:12.310
He's dead?

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.270
Nice. He got what he deserved.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:17.960
What did you say?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:18.750
Ding!

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.650
We must stay calm right now.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.550
This woman is vicious, gloating

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.010
over others' misfortune.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.160
Forget about Bai Ze.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.150
Let's kill her

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.370
and return to Chang'an to report.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.740
Commander Li isn't the murderer.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.640
Are we letting the Princess's underling

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.030
bring this news back to Chang'an

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:34.680
so everyone

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.240
can mock our Imperial Guard?

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.160
That would utterly disgrace His Majesty!

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.920
Yet it still doesn't justify
killing to silence her.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.590
Our Imperial Guards

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.440
have already lost three members.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.590
It's no big deal
if the Princess's Mansion loses

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.720
a regimental commander!

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.120
But...

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.810
No buts!

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.600
Let me be frank with you.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.600
His Majesty is testing your loyalty.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.000
We both once served
as the Right Imperial Guards.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.200
The night we executed Deposed Queen Wei,

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.920
we fought
that life-and-death battle together.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.250
We're brothers in arms.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.640
I don't want to see you

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.170
stand against His Majesty,

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.960
bringing utter disaster on yourself!

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.440
Will you help me or not?

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.510
Make your choice!

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:44.680
You...

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.450
Watch out for Commander Li!

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.070
Lu!

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.170
How dare you attempt
to kill the Princess's son?

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.420
Lu Lingfeng,

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.440
didn't you call us out

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.950
to be interrogated?

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.200
Can you still interrogate anyone now?

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.000
Li Nai'er,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.590
you...

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:21.830
Li Nai'er!

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.660
I found this in your room.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.880
As the Commander of the Princess's Guards,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.400
why are you
playing supernatural tricks here?

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.010
I'm doing this to kill you!

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.180
How arrogant.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.720
Although Lu Lingfeng is injured,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.960
Ding Heng is the General
of the Right Imperial Guards

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.710
with unmatched bravery and strength!

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:42.770
You think you

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.750
and this old man can kill us?

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.200
She's got a helper.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.540
It's an archer.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.400
Watch out, General Ding!

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:18.630
Huo Jing?

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:19.840
It's her?

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:21.480
You treacherous woman!

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.360
You fell off the cliff

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.960
and faked your death
just to harm people in secret?

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.910
So what if I did?

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.200
Nai'er taught me

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.020
that all's fair in war.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.710
Don't touch me,

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.760
you shameless scoundrel!

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.720
Huo Jing!

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.430
So that means

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.880
Huo You

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.170
and Wei Qi were

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.390
both killed by you?

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.570
That's right.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.000
It was a joint effort
from Huo Jing and me.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.660
Together, we're invincible.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.490
Nai'er was being way too cautious,

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.400
saying that you and Ding Heng were
skilled fighters.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.460
She wanted me to play dead
while she pretended to be weak.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.060
That's why you could
carry her again and again.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:52.920
The whole thing was just

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.420
to kill you one by one.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.280
We once thought
spreading news about Bai Ze

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.790
would lure the one on the throne

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.190
who most deserves to die.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.460
But unexpectedly,

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.070
even the blind Lu Tong

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.260
didn't dare to come up the mountain.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.200
Instead, he sent
you minions to get killed.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.240
You bold traitors!

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.750
Were you instructed by the Princess

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.310
to assassinate His Majesty here?

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.370
Confess the truth!

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.200
A mere Right Imperial Guard General
dares to interrogate me?

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.460
Let me send you to hell!

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.640
You're no more than a lame fighter.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.900
You think you can do it?

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.080
Lu Lingfeng,

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.200
you've served
as an Imperial Guard for years,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.840
rising to the rank of General,

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.720
but instead of serving your state loyally,

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.030
you helped these traitors

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.910
attack the Imperial Guards in secret!

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:30.880
I didn't!

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.040
General Ding,

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:33.680
it has come to this point!

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.200
What's the use of such a talk now?

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.440
Now, we should join hands
to fight our common enemy!

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.030
Shut up!

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:39.680
I'm talking to Lu Lingfeng.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.960
Who gave you the right to chip in?

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.290
Who do you think you are?

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.800
Lu Lingfeng,

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.160
the stab she gave you is
neither too deep nor too shallow.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.040
This girl has feelings for you.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.830
You've repeatedly

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:50.990
saved her from my attacks.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.450
You have feelings for her.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.290
I'll remember all this.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:55.920
After I

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.220
kill these traitors,

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.240
I will drag you back to Chang'an

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.040
to face His Majesty's judgment!

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:07.720
Girl!

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:52.270
What are you doing? Do you want to die?

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.330
Want to help? Watch my hidden weapon!

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.850
And one for you, too!

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.810
General Ding!

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.270
No!

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:44.160
Ding,

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.010
I'm so sorry.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:49.110
Look, Nai'er.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.320
They're on the same side.

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.120
Why show mercy?

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.550
Don't tell me

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.350
that you've fallen for that man.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.240
Did you murder Official Wei Qi

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.210
and Official Huo You
in the same way like this?

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.490
Killing an official
of the Imperial Guards is

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.920
much easier

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.290
than hunting a leopard.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.740
Is it you, Great Deity Bai Ze?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.130
Where are you going?

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:47.200
It's you.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.690
Judging from this murder weapon,

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.310
what's your relationship

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.610
with the guide Ling Ji?

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.800
Don't mention that useless man.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.200
Commander Li,

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.830
when you saw
that Ling Ji had hanged himself,

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:18.930
you shed tears

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.620
and even buried him properly.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.400
You two were

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.630
quite close, weren't you?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.600
I owed Senior Ling Ji a lot.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.160
If I hadn't persuaded Senior Huo Jing

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.240
to help me seek revenge,

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.370
they would have been married already.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.300
Perhaps

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.890
they'd even have children by now.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.160
So the three of you are fellow disciples?

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.050
That's right.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.780
I am the junior of Li Nai'er's master.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:51.360
And he's also my father.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.480
That's my mother.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.030
Back then,

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:55.720
I gave birth to her

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.840
under a Huo Jing persimmon tree.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.670
So I named her Huo Jing.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.960
I was somewhat deranged before,

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.680
but after giving birth to her,

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.210
I surprisingly recovered.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.750
Huo Jing has been fond of dolls
since she was little.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.480
So I'll make dolls for her my whole life.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.030
Don't waste our breath on them.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.240
The injured one has good fighting skills.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.280
Don't let him get a chance to escape.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.780
This scholar is

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.580
a powerless weakling.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.420
Let me have him

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.160
smoked into jerky

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.910
to feed my mount!

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.790
Ding,

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:31.690
I will avenge you.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.290
That's enough.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.110
Don't be rash.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.760
You're not lying to me, are you?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.620
If you're fellow disciples,

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:44.590
you should be accomplices!

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:46.650
Then why did Ling Ji hang himself?

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.720
He was a coward.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.790
I wanted to help
Junior Nai'er get revenge,

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:58.850
but he didn't dare.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.830
He wanted to be a loyal subject
of the Li family's Tang Dynasty.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:02.240
So I cut all ties with him.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.590
I get it now.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.400
You used him

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.640
to spread rumors that Bai Ze showed up.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.560
But I still can't figure it out.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.940
Wasn't he helping you all along?

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.600
Why would he kill himself?

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.900
I once promised Senior Ling Ji

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.000
to persuade Senior Huo Jing
to reconcile with him.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.400
I never said
I wouldn't reconcile with him.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.960
Taking the Heartbreak Cliff route was

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.750
just part of

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:32.930
our plan.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.510
When planning it,

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.170
I just forgot how petty he was.

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:37.720
Wait.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
You're the guide,

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.880
but have you never
been deep into Mount Zhongnan?

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.270
I'm a hunter from this area.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:44.240
Of course I have.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.530
Then why don't you know

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.000
that taking the Heartbreak Cliff route

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.800
would save us four hours' climb?

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.500
Are you sure we're going this way?

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.130
We must go this way.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.850
People familiar with Mount Zhongnan

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.070
should all know that there's

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.000
a lore about the Heartbreak Cliff.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.800
Any couple who are in love

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.050
should not cross this cliff together.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.200
If they do,

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.290
their relationship will end forever.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.930
This petty man

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.590
thought that I...

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:31.520
Senior Huo Jing,

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.830
I didn't think things through
and caused Senior Ling Ji's death.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:34.480
Stop it.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.160
Just the loss of a man.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.510
Although we failed to lure

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.160
Emperor Li over with this plan,

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.490
killing several Imperial Guard generals

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:45.430
still got your revenge done
to some extent.

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.310
The completion of this great deed

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.270
has made our lives meaningful.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:54.830
Wait a minute!

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.890
He's already seriously wounded.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:03.280
And I'm just

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.710
a helpless, weak scholar to be killed.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.270
What's the hurry?

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:09.510
Li Nai'er,

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:10.550
let me ask you.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.490
What deep grudge do you hold

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:15.540
against the Imperial Guards,

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.640
or rather, against His Majesty?

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.070
I'm not a Li.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.150
My surname is Shangguan.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.100
Shangguan Nai'er?

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.300
Lu Lingfeng，

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.240
[Li Nai'er]

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:31.460
on the night of the Tanglong era,

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.200
[Shangguan Nai'er]

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.660
you were also involved
in killing my sister.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.620
Therefore,

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.170
even if you're the Princess's son,

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:39.720
you must die.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.440
Impossible.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.830
The Shangguan family was prominent,

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.070
but during Emperor Gaozong's reign,

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.510
Empress Wu Zetian ordered

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.310
to execute their entire family.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.110
Only the newborn Shangguan Wan'er

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.970
and her mother were

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.760
taken into the inner palace.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.440
How could you possibly be

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.570
her younger sister?

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.110
My sister and I shared the same fate.

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.680
I was born into a family disaster.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.130
What made me more miserable was

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:08.920
that even my nursing mother was

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.670
killed.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.590
She took pity on me

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:12.920
and secretly took me in,

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.070
placing me in a Taoist temple
on Mount Zhongnan.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.400
She often came to see me.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.440
At first,

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.290
I called her "mother."

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:21.360
But she didn't allow it,

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.800
saying that her identity was special.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.060
If anyone found it out,

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.880
it would put me in fatal danger.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:28.840
So

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.860
she only let me call her "sister."

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.190
She also gave me a beautiful name,

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.239
Nai'er.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.480
She wanted me to take the surname Li,

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.679
but I preferred to be called Shangguan.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.110
My sister was also my mother.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.110
She was my everything.

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:47.639
And she gave me everything!

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.600
She was the "Red Plum Chancellor,"

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.520
virtuous, gifted,
and wise as a great help!

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.070
Without her,

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.210
how could Wu Zhao have governed the state?

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:02.590
Her literary talent was unparalleled.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.110
Her brilliance in literature, poetry,

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.880
and calligraphy was exceptional.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:06.760
Without her,

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:08.840
how would Chang'an have

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.300
so many amazing poems?

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.670
She has no family,

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.280
no heir,

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.280
and no allies. She was all alone.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.460
She devoted herself entirely
to the Li family's Tang Dynasty.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.880
Yet you

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.510
falsely accused her
of being Deposed Queen Wei's ally.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.670
On what grounds?

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.470
Her fate being dragged into the storm,

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.060
she passed away in haste.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.050
Lady Shangguan's passing is

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.320
truly heartbreaking.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:49.920
Also,

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.830
she was never part
of Deposed Queen Wei's faction.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:56.040
As far as I know,

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.350
in order to stop Deposed Queen Wei

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.630
and her daughter from usurping power,

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.710
she earnestly tried

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.590
to talk sense into Emperor Zhongzong
over and over again.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:08.090
She also requested to resign
and shave her head to be a nun.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.070
She even drank poisonous wine

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:11.870
to force the issue with her life.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:14.220
To be fair,

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.890
her merit in protecting
the Li family's Tang Dynasty

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.980
should be recorded

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.540
in history under Lady Shangguan's name.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.960
Facing death,

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:30.360
you, Su Wuming,

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.290
have finally said something fair.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.120
That's not true.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.510
He's just afraid of death!

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.720
But you failed.

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:42.480
I'm not as soft-hearted as Nai'er.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.760
Yes,

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:46.720
I am afraid of death.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.270
But I'm more afraid

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.470
that if you kill Lu Lingfeng,

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.490
you will fail

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.480
Lady Shangguan.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.160
What did you say?

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.770
The waters of Xiaoxiang have run dry;

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.030
the Wanwei Mountain has collapsed;

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.580
the pearl has sunk and broken;

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.020
the most precious jade is shattered.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.280
Gaze at the pines

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.840
and quietly listen at the grave.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.360
For thousands of years,

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.440
may your name be sung forever and ever.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.880
This is the epitaph
that the State-guarding Grand Princess

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.740
wrote for Lady Shangguan,

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.000
showing Her Highness's deep affection

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.920
for Lady Shangguan.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:29.550
But now,

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.320
you've set a trap

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.020
to harm Her Highness's son.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.030
Can you face

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:37.530
Lady Shangguan in heaven?

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.630
I've long heard that Master Di
has two disciples

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.030
who solved some cases in Chang'an

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.230
and earned some fame.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.580
Today I've finally seen them for myself.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.930
One with a silver tongue.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:52.640
And the other one

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.130
with a good-looking face.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:56.490
Lu Lingfeng,

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:57.480
you know what?

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.220
If you were less handsome,

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:01.230
Nai'er would have stabbed
all the way through

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.490
and twisted the blade,

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.570
and you would have been dead already.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.960
Su Wuming,

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:28.450
stop wasting your breath on them.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.070
I will kill these traitors

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.350
and avenge my fellow Imperial Guards!

00:38:59.110 --> 00:38:59.800
Nai'er!

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.150
Pull yourself together!

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:02.750
Go help your Senior Huo Jing.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:46.860
Li Nai'er!

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.410
Shangguan Nai'er!

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.400
Stop fighting.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.630
He really is the Princess's son.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.810
Stop making more mistakes!

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.230
You scholar, you are truly annoying.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.280
If you say one more word,

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.670
I'll kill you first!

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.510
You jerk,

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.670
just try to come at me!

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.900
I, Su Wuming, am protected
by divine power!
