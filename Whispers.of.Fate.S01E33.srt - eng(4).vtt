[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.940
[Episode 33]

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.110
Don't you dare... hurt my master...

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
Since you're so eager to die for him,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.920
I'll grant your wish.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.310
You can actually wake up in that state—

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.870
and it's because of him?

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.910
Someone like you
actually cares about others?

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.900
And you care about

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.690
such an insignificant person.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.760
How laughable.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.840
Fine.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.480
Then I'll let you

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.870
watch...

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.280
Almost there.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.270
Watch the person you care about
die right in front of you.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.100
Stone...

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.850
Just like I did back then!

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.520
Yan,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.890
why don't you understand?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.870
Back then...

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.079
I was just like you.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.079
Stone!

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.620
Fang Zhou's...

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.220
Pure Lotus Sutra?

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.760
How did you recover?

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.880
You were clearly struck by

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.620
the Thousand Curse Needle!

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.190
Shut up.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.800
Liu Yan.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.410
Your Thousand Curse Needle

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.040
did almost kill me,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.850
but

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.740
Fang Zhou's

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.470
heart crystal, which blocked
my heart meridian,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.180
also blocked your needle.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.190
I extracted his heart crystal,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.090
and the power

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.130
condensed within it before he died

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.500
merged with my meridians.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.850
That was his way

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:49.579
of telling me

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.220
not to hate myself.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.300
Letting him go

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.360
was the right choice.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.060
Fang Zhou

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.950
saved me again.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.829
Impossible!

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.640
Fang Zhou saved you?

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.220
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.770
Liu Yan.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.090
You know what?

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.670
The first time I ever felt regret

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.100
was...

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.500
for not killing you.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.980
Show me your strongest move.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.890
I promise

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.620
I'll make you feel pain to your very core

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.970
before you die filled with bitter regret.

and you can play the flute.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.060
Then

to you.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.380

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.460
you'll never get back

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.140
and I

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.610
can go

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.260
be with Fang Zhou now.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.110
This round...

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.800

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.620
you deserve to see Fang Zhou?

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.730
This time...

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.400
don't try to run from the truth again.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.890
This is what I learned

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.150
from Yique Yinyang's memory.

experience what I experienced

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.660
and feel what I felt.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.710
You are me,

and I am you.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:09.570
Liu Yan,

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.240
in the Heaven Halo,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.060
my consciousness is laid bare.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.480
I'll share it with you.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:15.990
Heaven-Halo Technique.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.410
Practice the Rebirth Scroll,

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.810
use it for power exchange,

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.560
and transfer the evil energy in you

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.330
to me.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.380
But you have to promise me first

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.060
that

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.260
you absolutely cannot let Yan

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.520
and Fu know about this.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.130
Let go!

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.050
Yan,

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.730
do you see

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.720
clearly now?

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.600
I'm the one

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.240
who caused Fang Zhou's death.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.590
I'm the one

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.060
who caused his body to be destroyed

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.760
and cut off his last chance to revive.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.940
I'm also the one

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.970
who, with my own hands, destroyed

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.490
what he wanted most—

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.300
peace in the jianghu.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.670
Fang Zhou...

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:05.940
I'm sorry.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.790
Lici...

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.060
I was wrong.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:20.980
Liu Yan.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.000
You've committed so many wrongs.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.490
You think you can escape responsibility

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:28.940
by killing yourself?

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.580
I'm telling you now,

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:31.450
no way.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.560
Listen carefully:

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.850
your life

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.230
is mine to take.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.020
And now...

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.740
I want you to live.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.970
Live

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.110
and slowly atone for all the wrongs

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.570
you've done.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.190
Live...

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.860
What a spectacular show this is.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.230
Looks like I've come at a bad time.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.180
I blocked it?

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:17.690
No,

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:19.310
it dissipated.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.710
Ten Calamities of the Void.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.120
The power of the Rebirth Scroll
has disappeared.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.180
You're surprised?

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.220
Countless rebirths—

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.540
two sides of one entity.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.810
Within this domain,

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.400
all things are me.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.970
I am the universe.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.320
Wind,

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:53.570
fire,

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.430
or water—

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.040
all things here

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.540
move according to my will.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:32.900
Shifting sands,

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:33.820
dense forest,

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:34.970
and cascading waterfall—

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.300
heaven and earth remade,

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.560
another Void created.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.460
I am the maker of all things,

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.480
unafraid of demons and gods.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.810
To break free from this,

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.420
you have to slaughter everything.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:46.450
Mr. Tang,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.110
you can't kill me.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.210
All of this was your scheme...

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.200
Ghostly Peony...

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:58.570
Yan!

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.620
As for you,

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.690
from the very day I met you

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:04.820
by the Yellow River,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.730
I knew you were

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.330
far too easy to control.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.430
Without obsession,

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.570
you'd never become extreme.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.180
Without extremity,
you'd never be narrow-minded.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.450
Without narrow-mindedness,

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.710
you'd have left me no opening to exploit,

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.830
nor any chance to lead you astray.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.400
In other words,

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.810
all weaknesses

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.450
stem from human emotions.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.670
Without emotions,
there would be no weaknesses

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:29.940
and no mistakes.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:33.990
Master Liu.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.370
Goodbye.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.850
The Lotus of Salvation blooms,
guiding countless souls across.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:49.780
Yan.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.140
Remember:

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:53.900
strive to live on.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.400
Lici!

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.500
Lici!

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.210
I didn't expect

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.610
that in such a short time,

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.300
you could break
the Heaven-Changing Scripture.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.500
You truly have the real Rebirth Scroll.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.230
Unfortunately,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.590
you have only half of it.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.250
Are you looking for this?

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.140
Mr. Tang,

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.660
you've lost.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:10.770
Shei,

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.380
please invite Mr. Tang

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.980
to the Plum Garden for a chat.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.380
The mighty Minister Tang

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.210
picked up someone
whose throat had been slit.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.180
You're actually still alive.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:04.860
They say

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.180
Minister Tang even adopted him
as his godson.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:07.970
Really?

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:09.620
He survived even with his throat slit?

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.750
You're still alive.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.620
You're still alive.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.050
How can you still be alive?

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.540
How?

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.280
How can you still be alive after that?

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:24.900
Monster!

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.140
You're a monster!

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.860
Why won't the jar
return to its original form?

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:39.860
Why?

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.140
Look at this pitiful creature.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.420
Is it that your enemy can't be killed,

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.900
or do you not dare to kill again?

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.580
Poor thing.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.660
How pathetic.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.380
Who is it?

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.660
Who's there?

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.820
How laughable...

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.620
Who is it?

00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.940
Who's there playing tricks?

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.010
Who?

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.670
The wine jar that can't be opened.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.340
The fire starter that can't be lit.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.040
The qin string

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.860
that can never be tuned!

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.750
Who do you think you are?

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.730
What gives you the right

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.050
to judge me?

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:28.900
I'm someone

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.290
who can help you make Tang Lici

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.770
regret everything he's done.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.790
This is the last one left in the world.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.130
Please cherish your hands.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.800
They're very precious to me.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.610
An evil pill!

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.340
An evil pill...

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.230
Yan.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:41.780
Remember:

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:43.860
strive to live on.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.420
Do you see

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:47.340
clearly now?

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:50.970
Lici...

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.880
I was wrong...

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:57.900
Fang Zhou...

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.290
I'm sorry.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.010
Lici...

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:07.900
You can't die.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.770
You can't die...

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:02.120
[Plum Garden]

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:08.770
Stone is seriously injured
and still unconscious.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:09.620
Tang Lici and Shei

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.660
are nowhere to be found.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.290
It must have been Liu Yan

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.290
who took them away during the chaos.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:18.530
There are traces of sword energy
in the valley

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.860
behind Qingyang Realm.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.070
Shen is tracking it.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.200
Hopefully, he'll find something.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.660
Listen to me...

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.810
Save...

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.140
I keep having the same dream.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.740
The dream in which I kill you.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.870
I've dreamed it countless times.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:10.900
Each time I dream,

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.010
I kill you in a different way—

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.420
each one more cruel

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.820
and vicious than the last.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.180
Save...

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.860
I've even been shocked awake...

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:22.860
Save...

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.120
By my own viciousness.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.660
But the moment I saw you,

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.450
I realized

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.940
that all those methods in my dreams

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.650
weren't vicious enough.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:45.240
Have you ever experienced
Floating Light Like Dreams?

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.680
It'll make you give in
to your inner demon,

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.700
forcing you to relive
your most painful memories.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:52.900
I'll let you

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.340
die slowly,

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.670
tortured in endless agony.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.410
Save...

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:00.820
Tang Lici...

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.540
Ghostly Peony...

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:07.250
has...

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:09.340
has caught...

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:10.900
What did you say?

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.820
In the Plum Garden...

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:16.980
Save...

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.210
Save...

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.580
The Plum Garden?

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.380
What kind of place is that?

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:33.900
No idea.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:34.620
But Liu Yan said

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.010
Tang Lici was taken there.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.420
Can we trust

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.930
that fiend's words?

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:40.580
Then what should we do now?

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.580
We can't just abandon Mr. Tang, can we?

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.420
Whether what he said is true or not,

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.180
Mr. Tang's life hangs in the balance.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.040
We can only choose to believe him.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.340
What matters now

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:50.620
is quickly figuring out a way

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.660
to find Mr. Tang.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.180
Perhaps there's one person

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.380
who might know about Mr. Tang's safety.

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.750
You, Enchantress from Fengliu Shop!

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.820
Master Puzhu,

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.270
what do you mean by this?

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:06.580
I'm here today

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:08.930
to introduce someone

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.390
to join the Sword Alliance.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.340
I'm Xifang Tao.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.820
Greetings, Master Shao.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.580
Greetings, Mr. Shen.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.580
I know who you are.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.560
No need for pleasantries.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.360
Master Puzhu,

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:24.930
you...

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.730
you want to recommend this Enchantress?

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:27.530
In this battle,

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.340
she helped us.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.120
Indeed.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.350
She helped Master Puzhu

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.030
kill Qiaoyi Qiankun.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:34.810
I know well that Fengliu Shop

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:35.970
has committed countless evils,

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.010
selling the Evil Pill

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.820
and bringing disaster
to the martial arts world.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.150
I've long wanted to
cut all ties with them.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.900
I hope all of you Sword Masters
will not hold past grudges

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.030
and give me a chance.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:46.440
I can provide

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.900
the full list of those who purchased

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.670
and consumed the Evil Pill.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.490
I will definitely help the Sword Alliance

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:53.690
root out Fengliu Shop

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.410
and eradicate the scourge
of the Evil Pill.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.450
Fine.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.100
Then tell me now—

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.340
where is the Plum Garden?

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:13.860
Mr. Shen.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.020
I'm afraid that if I tell you,

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.980
far more innocent lives

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.620
will be lost in vain
than those who perished

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.020
in Xiuyu Peony Pavilion.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:24.150
Shen,

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.940
this isn't the place
to discuss such a matter.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.740
Stone is seriously injured now.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.040
Come with me to check on him first.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.350
The outsider doesn't need to
come along, right?

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:53.050
Mr. Shen,

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.780
you seem to have some prejudice
against me.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.430
Every bit of my martial arts skill

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.080
was taught by Ghostly Peony.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:00.380
I know

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.040
his strength better than anyone.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.440
Since he can defeat Tang Lici and Liu Yan,

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.970
with the weakened forces
remaining in the Sword Alliance,

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.830
attempting to attack Plum Garden

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.830
would be like throwing eggs at a rock.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:14.820
Shen,

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.770
let Miss Xifang

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.560
come in and talk properly.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.240
Miss Xifang.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.870
Do you have more information

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.520
about Ghostly Peony and the Plum Garden?

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.550
Ghostly Peony

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.490
feels nothing.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.660
I've been adopted by him for many years,

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.190
yet all I've ever seen in him

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.100
is

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.620
a monster devoid of

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.420
any feelings.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:57.900
My fate

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.010
will be

00:27:59.010 --> 00:27:59.940
no better than

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.770
that of those decayed puppets.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.620
That's also one of the reasons

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.220
I defected to your alliance.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.490
I know you all still have doubts about me.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:07.660
I'll prove my worth

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.070
through my actions.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:12.620
Then isn't Mr. Tang in grave danger?

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:13.140
Master Shao...

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.210
Miss Xifang has been very honest.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.400
Master Puzhu, perhaps we should
let her finish.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.820
As for attacking the Plum Garden,

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.860
I can only say this:

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.140
his every scheme is

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:24.820
meticulously planned,

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:26.790
and every judgment,

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.440
utterly rational.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.350
A man like that,

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.050
if he's still staying put,

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:33.580
it means

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.620
he's certain

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.180
he can fend off any invaders.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.680
You think I'd be afraid of him?

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.740
This time, I agree.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:41.690
We must go rescue him.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.260
I don't believe it.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.480
Surely with me,

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.350
plus Puzhu,

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.530
Shen Langhun, and Chi Yun,

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:49.600
we can do it.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.250
I don't wish to embarrass you,

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.820
but I must truthfully tell you this—

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:56.130
you can't.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:28:59.140
At least not now,

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.070
while all of you are still injured.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.890
Even with Sword Master Shao
and me added in,

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.580
it's still impossible.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:06.620
I can give you

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.340
the location of the Plum Garden,

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.080
but that would only be

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.940
sending all of you to your deaths.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.730
What kind of monster is he?

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:15.590
That powerful?

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.290
However, everyone can rest assured.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.890
If Ghostly Peony truly wanted to
kill Mr. Tang,

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.630
he would have done so long ago.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.090
Then what exactly is his purpose?

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:26.780
Though he's not dead,

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.940
he's not exactly alive either.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.140
What do you mean?

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:31.970
Resurrection

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:33.820
requires a body.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.800
Without one,

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.140
he cannot truly be resurrected.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.900
He doesn't want to kill Mr. Tang.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.620
He wants to use Mr. Tang's body...

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.010
to resurrect Yique Yinyang.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.100
Where am I?

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:28.620
Are you looking for this?

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:40.870
As expected,

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.370
my inner strength has been sealed too.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:15.820
Come out.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.800
Mr. Tang, you refuse to eat...

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.760

your tricks are

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.230
impressive indeed.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.740

yourself as a superior being,

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.340

The Leader believed

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:10.970
ordinary schemes couldn't fool you,

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:11.620

Rather than whether I enjoyed it,

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.310
I'd like to know—

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:24.880
how was my acting?

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.530

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.030

take a guess—

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.050
the battle on Tiandu Peak

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.050

in Inverted Dream

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.830
was not the original battle at all.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.700
In the true

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.900
original battle,

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:26.940
Yique Yinyang won.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:31.000
All Seven Masters were killed,

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.420
including

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.410
Fang Zhou.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.260
Even so,

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:42.090
Yique Yinyang failed

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:43.570
to accomplish

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.270
what he truly desired.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.050
Mr. Tang,

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.530
why do you think that?

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.340
Yique Yinyang, like myself,

00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.780
is a clever man.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:01.900
And clever men

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.220
don't go to great lengths

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.550
for useless endeavors.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.490
From what I

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:09.420
witnessed in that Inverted Dream,

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:11.550
with Yique Yinyang's full might,

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:13.090
the Seven Masters

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.270
stood no chance of winning.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.450
He had you trick Fang Pingzhai

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.010
into creating the Inverted Dream

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.380
with Qiaoyi Qiankun.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.670
The real purpose

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:23.940
was to let me

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.260
stop his past self

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.030
from killing Fang Zhou.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.380
If what he truly wanted to do

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.240
had succeeded,

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:37.150
why would he bother

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:39.340
reversing time?

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.270
Therefore, that matter

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.080
must be very important to him—

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:45.490
so important that he was willing to

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:47.150
abandon his own physical body

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.220
to make it happen.

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:52.300
Mr. Tang...

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:55.850
you are really smart.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:58.300
Then let me continue my guess—

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.860
what could Yique Yinyang

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.760
truly want to accomplish?

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.840
With power rivaling that of the gods,

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:09.300
what could

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.030
possibly lie beyond his reach?

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.090
He thinks of nothing but killing

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.220
and has no weakness.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.340
Why hasn't he achieved

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.000
the perfect Tianren body yet?

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:19.490
He must complete his cultivation
as soon as possible

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.340
to accomplish our great plan.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.740
Is there a possibility that...

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.790
Bai Nanzhu's so-called great plan

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.490
and what Yique Yinyang wants to do

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:32.780
are the same thing?

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.300
And this matter

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:37.180
requires the Bronze Pillar

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.170
and a perfect

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.610
Tianren body.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:42.420
But his path to cultivating a Tianren body

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.080
was wrong from the beginning.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:46.420
When he first arrived in Shenzhou,

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.170
his experience in the Gumo State

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:49.220
tainted his body

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.450
with malice,

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.270
making it impossible
to achieve perfection.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:54.260
Therefore,

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.510
he began scheming against me.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:58.610
This way,

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.260
everything makes sense.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.090
So...

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:07.340
he couldn't let Fang Zhou

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.140
die in the battle on Tiandu Peak.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.080
Because...

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:16.290
he needed Fang Zhou, who had a heart
full of great love,

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.450
to find me,

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:20.670
bring me back to Zhoudi Tower,

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.700
and teach me with devotion.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.570
Then he needed Fang Zhou to die
because of me

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:30.030
so that Fang Zhou's death...

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:33.920
would become an insurmountable nightmare

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.440
in my heart,

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:36.530
thus

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.900
making me stop him from

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.790
killing Fang Zhou in the Inverted Dream.

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:46.570
And his ultimate purpose

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:47.610
in all of this...

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.940
is to make me

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:52.780
walk a path

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.650
entirely different from his—

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.260
one that fully experiences
the seven emotions

00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.660
and reaches perfection.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.190
The cause of the past...

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:12.970
is the effect of the present.

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:15.490
And the effect of the present

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.680
is also the cause of the past.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:21.970
What a truly perfect closed loop.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.530
Just now...

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.940
I said you were bad at acting

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:32.770
because

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.910
in the play at Zhoudi Tower,

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:36.390
there is birth,

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:37.850
sickness,

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.770
and death.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:42.690
And all of it

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:45.490
causes suffering.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.400
Hatred brings suffering.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.530
Parting from what you love
brings suffering.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.300
Not obtaining what you desire
brings suffering.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.760
But if one has no emotions,

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.390
there is no suffering.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.830
And if one doesn't feel suffering,

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:04.590
then naturally...

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.910
naturally it cannot be acted out.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:13.820
Mr. Tang, teach me then.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:18.340
It seems

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:20.860
you don't have human feelings,

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.390
but you already have human curiosity.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:25.530
Curiosity killed the cat,

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.060
and it kills puppets too...

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.110
How about...

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.260
you and I play

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.450
a game?

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:41.010
A game?

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:42.710
Mr. Tang, do you take me

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.780
for a child?

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.140
When I first came to Shenzhou,

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.010
I didn't understand human feelings.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:48.670
So Fang Zhou

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.720
taught me
using the Three Character Classic

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:52.950
that children read.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.090
In other words,

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:56.260
I don't know what emotions are,

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:58.890
so you want to teach me through games.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.340
That makes sense.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.340
What game?

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.990
Yique Yinyang

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:08.090
set countless traps

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.300
for me.

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.380
Don't you want to know

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.780
how I feel?

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.340
You can ask me questions

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.220
and pick one

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:19.530
of these masks

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.740
that you think suits my mood.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.610
Interesting.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:26.860
Let me ask you, Mr. Tang—

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.090
when you learned that everything
you experienced in Shenzhou

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.420
was carefully orchestrated by my master,

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.130
what did you feel?

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:35.970
I guess...

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:39.010
you felt angry.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:40.450
Wrong.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:41.940
I felt joy.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:45.940
Joy?

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:46.970
Because

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.000
I need to thank Yique Yinyang.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:50.700
If he hadn't

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.570
orchestrated everything so meticulously,

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.500
how could I have ever met Fang Zhou?

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.290
And how could I have lived

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:58.130
those seven beautiful years

00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:59.700
in Zhoudi Tower?

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:00.610
Then, how did you feel when you learned

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:02.450
that I deliberately made
Liu Yan return early,

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:04.010
causing you to fail in saving Fang Zhou,

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:05.090
merely to make you into

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:06.650
a suitable vessel

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.970
so he could be resurrected
and return to this world?

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:09.740
This time,

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.190
it must be anger, right?

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:14.000
Leader,

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.140
you're wrong again.

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:17.940
Yique Yinyang isn't

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.340
the only one who wanted me

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:21.140
to become a perfect vessel.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.360
Back in the Tianren Realm,

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.080
I'd already gone through it once before.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.260
Now that I've experienced it again,

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:30.010
I only find it laughable.

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:33.500
What about Shei?

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.840
Surely, she must've made you angry.
