(Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and KOCCA)

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.240
(This is a work of fiction. All names, characters, )

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.410
(and incidents are products of the author's imagination.)

(15th Century, Joseon)

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.630
It is morning already.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.229
All I want for my lord,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.129
who saw potential in this humble servant,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.140
is to bring him joy.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.540
You summoned me, a mere commoner,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.650
to your royal presence,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.150
and ordered me to strengthen Joseon through technological advancement.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.650
I humbly bow to accept your command.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.100
A position that had no name.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.600
If there are more people like me in the future,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.670
what would we be called?

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.200
To open...

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.240
and to develop.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.710
Someone who opens up new possibilities.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.980
A person who develops and makes them a reality.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.650
Yes, that is it.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.450
"Developer" would be the perfect name.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.590
Your Highness, the Crown Prince!

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360
What is the meaning of this!

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.639
This is the only Honcheonui blueprint.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.840
Your Royal Highness.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.210
You pathetic fool.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.010
Yeong Sil.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.410
Pay him no mind.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.080
Your Majesty.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.120
Seeing today's great laptop tragedy, I got this idea for a web novel.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.230
A poignant friendship between King Sejong and Jang Yeong Sil,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.230
and the Crown Prince, his enemy, has great chemistry with Yeong Sil.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.130
My ears are bleeding. Na Rae, are you trying to get sued?

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.500
Seriously. A genius who transcended class...

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.110
to fall for such a pathetic prince.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.310
It's an insult.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.110
Send an angry emoticon.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.650
I wouldn't call him dim-witted. Crown Prince Munjong was brilliant.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.080
Right, the Cheugugi was actually Munjong's idea.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.249
The prince from my story is actually based on Grand Prince Suyang...

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.490
But why did you use my face and San's for the characters?

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.290
Because you two are the hottest engineers I know!

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.330
So, are you skipping the group blind date?

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.400
Why would you even ask when you know I'm not into that?

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.730
Not you, Yeon San!

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.329
How can you even ask that...

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.600
when you know the state San's in today?

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.110
(Number one on XXX)

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.500
You actually came, Min Hak.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.770
Of course.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.970
You were great out there earlier.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.310
Careful.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.850
(LOVE.exe)

(Episode 3: New Semester Promo)

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.320
(Eight Hours Earlier)

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.520
- It's mine! - Mine! Mine!

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.650
Everyone, quiet down, please!

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.860
Alright, time for my daily good deed for the environment...

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.300
I told you it was mine.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.230
I clearly said it was mine.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.130
Besides, you can obviously see it's a different laptop!

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.270
To be fair, it looked just the same a second ago.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.710
Let's get the council room bullhorn.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.070
If we wait, they'll walk all over us.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.210
Wait, the thing is...

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.240
that the matter of who's at fault is a bit unclear.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.850
Hey, where's our rookie?

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.479
If you're talking about responsibility,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.120
I clearly said it was mine and was approaching to get it,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.289
but your security guard forcibly stopped me.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.090
Now, I understand that,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.660
because these fans were shouting, "He's mine,"

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.830
he mistook me for one of them. I'll grant you that.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.100
But in all that chaos, what was I supposed to...

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.200
I'm really grateful for my fans,

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.570
but hearing "he's mine" can be a little suffocating sometimes.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.070
I wonder if she's one of your fans, too?

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.340
Or maybe not?

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.950
Then she could be one of your fans, Jinny.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.650
That's it, she's one of your fans! Right?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.250
It must've been "Jinny's mine" then. Not "Min Hak's mine."

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.190
Gosh, what is wrong with me?

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.190
I'm so full of myself, aren't I?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.660
Stop laughing.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.760
Wipe that soda up so it's not sticky.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.570
- Gosh, what a mess. - Is this supposed to shut me up?

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.600
Won't that do?

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.140
I'm even paying for this out of my own pocket.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.640
Your own pocket? The rookie staffer's own pocket?

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.810
Hold on, Yeon San.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.910
As I'm responsible for this space, I can't let this injustice slide.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.619
Who are you?

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.280
I'm the Emergency Chair of the Computer Engineering Department.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.490
- Who's in charge here? - That's you!

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.459
- Yes? - You broke someone's property,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.930
and you're making the rookie pay?

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.490
I'm not the one who broke it.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.830
So what? Why should the person with the least authority pay for it?

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.070
Shouldn't their bosses cover this? That's why they're paid more, right?

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.770
All right, who's the producer here?

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.439
We need to get back to filming,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.810
so let's talk about this after we wrap up.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080
For now, could you please step aside?

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.180
I'm not moving an inch until someone takes responsibility.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.550
Everyone! Scrum!

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.680
Scrum!

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.720
Do you know who that tall, dashing woman over there is?

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.189
Her?

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.390
She's Kang Dong Won, the CS chair,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.390
Your Majesty.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.430
Her real name is Kang Dong Won.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.660
But her nickname is also "Kang Dong Won from Engineering."

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.060
Interesting.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.500
Kang Dong Won.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.140
Heads of Hair and Makeup, can I have you for a moment?

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.380
Hey, Jinny.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.150
Oh, gosh.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.050
Didn't I tell you to always be careful when you're mic'd?

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.290
Sorry. But hey,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.860
I was just wondering what your schedule was like after this.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.260
There's a screening I have to go to in Yongsan.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.830
Director Cha Nook invited me.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.200
What about tomorrow? Are you free tomorrow?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.040
Just tell me now.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.870
It's just the two of us here.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.410
The thing is...

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.250
Min Hak.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.180
I think we need to make a change.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.320
Really?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.650
That's exactly what I was going to tell you.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.120
- You were? - Yes.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.260
I think it's time for us to take the next step.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.000
Exactly! The next step!

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.870
To advance in our careers, we can't afford to be complacent.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.540
We have to look toward the future.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.040
Gosh.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.810
I was a little nervous about this.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.580
But it turns out we're on the same page.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.050
So what should we do?

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.990
When should we go public?

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.020
Go public? With what?

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.790
What?

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.430
You said "next step," so I just assumed...

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.900
Okay. Keeping it private is fine too.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.800
It would just be a headache for you if people found out anyway.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.210
Min Hak. I was saying we should end things.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.780
For good.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.680
You and I are just friends.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.180
You're no idol or actor, Min Hak, so you're not even a coworker.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.050
We're just...

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.360
someone who was just passing through my life...

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.030
Just passing through...

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.030
But we kissed...

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.800
That was just a happening.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.970
We're both young and beautiful. Things happen, right?

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.710
Maybe if it was once, but three times is...

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.740
And what's more, last week we...

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.310
No. Look, Min Hak.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.320
Our careers are on shaky ground.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.020
We could vanish and nobody would care.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.590
I'm an actress, and my best credit? Honestly?

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.660
It's that "Like Dew" soju commercial.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.200
And you're just a semi-celebrity who started on "Match on Wheels."

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.830
Don't you think we both need to take that next step?

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.700
So...

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.870
you're saying I'm not your next one.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.310
I'm going to the US this fall.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.380
It's for a streaming original film.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.980
You know my biggest dream, right?

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.220
To be bigger than Jung Ho Yeon and make your mark in Hollywood.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.190
Yes, exactly. I want that more than anything.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.830
Not Jinny, the washed-up idol, but Jinny, the global superstar.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.230
That's really awesome.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.670
From our own respective places,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.240
you, right where you are,

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.840
and me, right where I am.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.080
Let's each do our absolute best,

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.380
and raise our worth, our value,

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.950
and then meet again, Min Hak.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.350
Doing our best on our own for now.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.660
What she's saying is so complicated.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.130
And she's using so much English.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.930
Okay, we can't just stand around here all day.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.230
So you two, just settle it with rock-paper-scissors.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.239
- What? - One of you two has to pay for it.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.540
Or just split it fifty-fifty.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.710
Come on. Rock-paper-scissors.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.510
- Go on. - Ready?

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.609
If you don't throw, you lose. Rock-paper-scissors!

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.650
Wait a minute.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.380
I'll pay for it.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.660
What? Why would you, Min Hak?

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.030
I'm the one who broke the laptop, so I should pay for it.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.300
Are you okay? Don't cry. It's my fault. I'm sorry.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.570
How much do I owe you?

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.410
Alright, let's run the numbers, shall we?

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.410
You spectacularly wrecked this new 2025 laptop.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.020
With an Intel Core Ultra 200HX CPU and a GeForce RTX 5070 GPU.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.020
Those two components alone are well over 3,000 dollars,

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.130
plus three 1-terabyte SSDs in a Super RAID 5 configuration.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.130
Those run 170 dollars a piece, totalling 510 dollars.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.900
Importantly, with data recovery, the grand total is...

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.370
Hold on a second.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.800
I need a calculator.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.669
And that amount I just quoted?

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.209
That's not even including compensation for my inconvenience...

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.380
while the laptop contents are being recovered.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.249
And if the recovery is impossible,

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.250
then there's the priceless value, which is incalculable.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.020
- Three hundred thirty times... - Forget it.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.589
Just give me your number.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:24.790
I'll send you the official estimate,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.160
and you can wire the money right over.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.760
Okay.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.100
Gosh, did you see that? San got Kang Min Hak's number.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.830
- Was that her plan? - Wait!

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.799
No. I can't allow that.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.870
I'm his manager, so please talk to me.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.970
As long as someone is responsible, I don't care who.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.080
Here.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:47.910
This will work, right?

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.920
Min Hak, Jinny's team is panicking because we're delayed.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.120
What? Right.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.390
Let's go.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.660
I'll draw up the estimate and will be in contact!

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.059
Were you about to give her your number?

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.630
Good thing I was there to stop you.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.529
That's how you get psycho stalkers.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.640
They shout, "He's mine!" Don't you know that?

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.970
I don't think she's like that.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.870
Besides,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.280
I have to take responsibility for my own actions.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.210
I know. You're so responsible and naive.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.680
That's why I'm here, to protect you. See?

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.150
- I know, and I'm always grateful. - So, did you ask Jinny about it?

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.720
Well...

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.360
I didn't get a chance to bring up the drama.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.290
Why not? What were you so busy talking about?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.669
What I mean is that if Jinny recommends you for it,

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.930
it's a natural and great opportunity.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.400
Excuse me, Min Hak?

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.640
I didn't get to say a proper hello earlier.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.540
Min Hak, thank you so much.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.280
Don't mention it.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.780
Min Hak, go get your touch-up now. You know where to go, right?

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.080
- Right now? - Yes. Go to the hall by the corner.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.850
Excuse me. One second.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.560
You really went through it earlier.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.100
No. I'm grateful to him, but I feel bad.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.030
He's just a genuinely good-hearted person.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.500
But people online twist things and say his head's in the clouds.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.240
Some people just love to trash him.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.909
I'm worried that this whole laptop incident...

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.880
will also start a rumour.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.410
Should I post something online to stop those kinds of rumours?

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.509
I'll write that he's a total angel, a saviour, a prince!

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.320
Gosh, you don't have to do all that.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.090
Maybe don't exaggerate quite that much.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.220
Just stick to the facts. Like you said, an angel, a saviour...

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.419
Could you post that somewhere for us?

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.559
- Of course. - Right.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.159
I have a video of what happened.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.060
Should I send you a screenshot?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.170
- Yes, that'd be great. - Yes.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.200
Great.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.639
Isn't this a blessing in disguise?

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.080
You might get a new laptop from this.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.580
But she hadn't backed it up.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.280
Her high school data is on there.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.220
I'm heading to a data recovery center first.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.920
If it weren't for that brainless fool...

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.620
Excuse me.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.990
Yes?

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.059
Sorry, it's just been bugging me.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.900
I'm sure I've seen you somewhere.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.070
I don't think so. Like I said, I'm not a fan or...

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.170
Now he's going to say, "Are you Ahn In Dae?" again.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.670
I guess I just have one of those faces.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.810
We have no connection, so please just go on your way.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.580
I'll contact your manager about the repair estimate.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:37.920
I knew it.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.190
- You're a fan of Jinny's? - What?

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.620
I can tell by how indifferent you've been to me.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.620
By the way, good job just now. Making up with those staff members.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.230
What are you talking about?

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.760
I don't mean to criticize, but if you're too harsh with staff,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.000
you know, it can make your celebrity look bad.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.700
So on Jinny's behalf, I'd like to thank...

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.970
Should I rip his head off?

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.840
If you want to film something, I could do a reel with you.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.050
What do you say?

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.900
I want to crack his head open and see what's inside.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.899
What could possibly be going on in a head like that?

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.140
(Yongsan)

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.210
Who knows. But I can't tell if this is even recoverable.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.180
So...

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.780
you rushed all the way to Yongsan this late at night for this?

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.320
That's why I need you to recover it, no matter what.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.850
I'll have something to share in two weeks.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.050
Two weeks?

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.719
It's going to cost you 800 dollars.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.620
But for an extra 200 dollars,

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.590
I might be able to get it done a week faster.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.760
That's a lot more than what it said online.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.360
For water damage, I'd charge 300 and call it a day.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.370
But this wasn't water. It was a sugary drink.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:04.570
What difference does that make?

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.499
Your follow-up care was all wrong.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.440
And it's a one-terabyte drive,

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.240
which is double the size of most laptops.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:17.110
Plus, the newer models are a lot trickier to work on.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.120
- I'll pay once it's recovered. - Payment is upfront.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.889
Look, I'm doing the work regardless.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.660
The price is for my labour.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.230
Fine.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.030
It's not like I'm the one who'll be footing the bill anyway.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.130
(Hangang University)

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.740
You could've just used a hand double for the laptop shot.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.510
Hey, where's Jinny?

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.270
She filmed her part and left two hours ago.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.840
It wasn't even a cameo.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.180
Said she had to go to a screening.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.180
So you were stuck waiting forever for no reason.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.520
I'm fine.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.750
We didn't have anything scheduled afterwards anyway.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.420
You're too nice for your own good.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.520
Let's go. You're heading home, right?

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.330
It's about the laptop from earlier. I've taken it in for repairs.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.670
I'll let you know as soon as I get the estimate.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.040
Hey, I'm going to go meet up with a friend real quick.

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.240
A friend? All of a sudden? Who?

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.610
- Do Not Answer. - Well...

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.180
- Min Hak. - Yes?

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.350
Look, I don't care who you meet.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.820
Stay out of trouble, and we're good.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.790
You get me? I'm trusting you.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.160
Thanks.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.760
I'll drop you off.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.590
Seriously? You won't pick up?

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.560
These jerks must be on social media.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.130
Let's see, his handle is...

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.530
What a pain.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.740
I swore to never use SNS again, but I guess I'll have to send a DM.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.540
What the heck?

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.180
Kang Min Hak bought a pricey laptop to cover for a staffer's mistake.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.879
I heard there was an ad shoot on campus, so I went to watch.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.250
Jinny and Kang Min Hak are stunning.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.890
A laptop got snapped in half. A staffer confused it with a prop.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.619
The laptop owner made a huge scene.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.960
He said the staffer wasn't at fault, but his own.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.490
- He's an angel, a saviour, a prince. - A prince.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.560
So he breaks my laptop, ghosts me, and now he gets to be the hero?

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.240
(Yongsan Electronics Market, Sinyongsan Station)

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.370
It's so chaotic. Darn it.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.350
My Tuna.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.110
How much did you drink?

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.750
What took you so long? I was dying to see you.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.720
Sorry. Let's go.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.190
Gosh! You're drunk. Let's go.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.990
Come on. Let's go.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.960
No, I don't want to go. Let's just stay a little longer.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.230
Cheers!

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.700
Let's stay a little longer.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.140
You like the student council more than me, don't you?

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.870
- Come on, let's go. - Go where? You're so mean.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.310
Come on, guys. Aren't you bored?

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.410
It's been forever since my last blind date.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.049
Let's liven things up! Okay, "Timing Game"! One!

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.079
- Two! - Three!

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.120
- Four! - Five!

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.020
- Drink up! - I'll be your Black Knight.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.860
- Come on. - What's this?

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.260
Come on. Seriously?

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.329
- Timing Game! One! - Two!

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.430
- Three! -Three!

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.300
Okay!

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.630
Drink up.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.570
- Hey. - Drink up.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.930
- Let me get this one. I'm serious. - Come on.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.940
- Oh, boy. - Unbelievable.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.370
He can't even handle his liquor.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:28.940
I mean, come on.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.510
Gosh, look at him go.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.280
You can really hold your liquor.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.880
I'm sending you that repair bill as soon as I can, no matter how.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:41.990
That darn Kang Min Hak!

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:53.160
If this is just a simulation, may its developer be cursed too.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.510
This is nice.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.350
If someone breaks up with you and then calls you at night,

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.480
you're supposed to just ignore them.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.620
Even if they're drunk, begging you to come over,

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.160
just turn off your phone.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.920
How could I do that?

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.190
What if the next day I pretended I didn't remember anything...

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.890
and say I never asked you to come over?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.930
Then I'd just think, "I guess she didn't call me."

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.370
Why bother? Why go to all that trouble for me?

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.910
You're so sweet, Min Hak.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.320
You're not like your dad.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.420
You could never be like him.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.890
Never ever.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.290
You should get some sleep, Jinny.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.970
You're so cute. My Min Hak.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.910
Focus on me.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.180
But your phone's ringing.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.020
Hello?

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.450
Really?

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.450
So who's there?

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.430
I don't think I know them.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.600
I'll call you back.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.640
Hey, I think I have to go.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.810
Apparently, Amy says the directors...

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.380
and the foreign guests are waiting for me.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.180
But I haven't even finished watching the movie.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:49.810
What should I do?

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.220
You should go, then.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:53.950
Sorry.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.420
Want to rest here for a bit?

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.650
I'm okay.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:00.520
Jinny, you reek of alcohol.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.160
I'll head out first,

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.160
so you can take your time getting ready.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:05.930
Okay.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.440
That kid's head is in the clouds, and that manager's a total scammer.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.810
I'll just use my anonymous account to bring justice down on you two.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.480
But I'll be reasonable about it.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.050
"Awaiting response for laptop cost."

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.650
Darn it. This battery issue again...

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:08.860
Excuse me.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.430
What are the odds of this encounter?

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.869
Is the creator of this game...

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.970
just a developer who is obsessed with encounters?

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.240
Freeze!

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.910
Hey, wait, hold on!

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.620
Hey, you! Look at this!

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.790
How can you just walk away like that...

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.820
What am I supposed to do if...

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.140
I knew you wouldn't just let me walk away.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.850
Hey, let go of me.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.250
What are you doing? Let go.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.620
Why?

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.460
Hey, I said let go! How dare you just grab and hug me?

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.160
I'm sorry. The noise cancellation on my headphones works so well...

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.000
- You're the girl from before. - Yes. The one from...

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.640
- You were really an obsessive fan? - An obsessive fan?

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.470
So this is what it's like. They just follow you all day.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.340
Seriously?

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.809
As I told you before,

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:38.379
being like this won't help your celebrity.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.320
If you truly care about someone,

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.949
you need to know when to let go. Got it?

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:44.149
Let go of what?

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.690
Why don't you let go of some cash for my laptop?

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.620
What's her problem?

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:49.630
Gosh.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:53.160
Hey, where are you going?

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.900
Who's a fan of who? You think the world's your fan club?

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.029
I wish that weren't the case,

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.500
but we keep running into each other, day and night.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.039
On top of that, it's from Gyeonggi Province to Yongsan.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.070
And before that, too.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.739
We've seen each other around before. Right?

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:09.410
The reason you think you've seen me is because you have!

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.349
We're in the same department!

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.680
That ridiculously named...

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.260
Converged Physical Technology and Global Content Development major!

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.930
We keep meeting on our small, and now even smaller, campus.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.689
Do you even remember the laptop you broke today?

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.259
You bent it, poured soda over it,

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.369
and tried drying it with a hairdryer!

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.999
I need it for my job, my schoolwork, and a competition,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.270
which is why I came to the electronics mecca,

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:33.969
all the way to Yongsan!

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.340
And what? A fan? An obsessive fan?

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.210
So it's okay to just grab and hug any fan you see?

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.880
Now I get it. I completely misunderstood.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.510
You're just figuring that out now?

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.780
It's kind of a long story.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.550
So why isn't your manager picking up his phone?

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:56.489
I had no idea he wasn't picking up. I'm sorry.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:00.300
But I really have to go now, so if you give me your number...

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.460
I don't trust you anymore.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.669
Yes, that's fair.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.969
Then if you give me your phone, I'll put my number in for you.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.100
My battery's dead.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.240
Dead...

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.940
Then do you have any paper?

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.820
I promise I'll contact you.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.030
My repair estimate!

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.340
Hey, the numbers are all smudged! Hey, stop!

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:41.470
Wait a second!

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.410
Get out of the way!

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320
What do you think you're doing?

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.050
I couldn't just let you get hurt.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.760
Right. And for a second...

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.870
- Someone call for a ride? - I didn't!

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:18.740
Well, you were shouting "Stop," so I thought...

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.540
Anyone here going to Gangnam?

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.220
- Coming through. - Yes, go ahead.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.920
The group blind date today totally bombed.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.090
Is a bad date supposed to be news?

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.590
When my day...

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.359
Gosh, I always think my dry spell would end...

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.500
at the start of every semester.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.440
These guys won't even reply to me.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.240
Darn it...

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.040
And look at me, just watching dramas about guys falling in love.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.950
Okay. Now, less bicep, more trap.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.480
Yes, those traps are looking tasty. Let's feed them.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:08.490
That's it.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:11.390
Hey, you!

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.829
You know these walls are paper-thin.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.830
What was that about something tasty?

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.100
Sorry. My personal training session was scheduled for tonight.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.530
No, wait, what? Who does personal training at home?

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.800
You seem to go to our school. Let's try to be more considerate.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.070
Okay. I'm sorry. We'll be quiet now.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.210
Come on.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.180
All right, push it all the way up!

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.340
Okay. All right, feel the burn.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:35.850
Okay.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:37.480
Oh, that's good.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.750
I need to de-stress.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.690
Should I watch "The Demon Slayer" that Finnish drama?

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.890
No. Lego ASMR.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.090
Or maybe I should just get to work first?

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.600
There are thousands of reasons why a bug might occur.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:01.940
You might have missed a use case or used the wrong formula.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.540
Why would they send me this?

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.580
I'm telling you, it's not a hardware problem.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:12.450
Or you went outside the memory area allocated for the program,

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.720
applied the wrong operation to the data,

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.720
or you failed to check if the user input was valid.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.860
(Park Chang Yi)

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.030
San, long time no see.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.210
Or, like the moth that flew into Grace Hopper's computer,

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:40.810
it's because something got in that shouldn't have.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.890
What are you doing here?

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:56.730
I came here to apologise.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.200
How did you know where I live?

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.630
The dean told me.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.370
Is he even allowed to do that?

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.540
I'm a little wet from the rain. Mind if I take this off?

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:12.540
Yes, I do mind.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:14.940
Darn it.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.020
Joo Yeon San.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.060
Why aren't you answering me?

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.360
What?

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:39.800
What's Python?

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.240
- What? - This.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.840
It's a programming language.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.580
A language?

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:53.550
It's more dynamic and concise than other languages.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.190
And it's highly readable.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.820
So it's great for everyone, from beginners to experts.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.160
So even beginners can use it?

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.430
And it's dynamic?

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.670
Concise doesn't necessarily mean easy.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.970
But it's compatible with a lot of different operating systems.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:21.240
So they can connect with each other?

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.350
Like us?

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.090
Even though we're different?

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.130
Which is why it's highly scalable.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:45.670
Can I kiss you?

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.740
Did you hear me?

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.680
Processing.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.120
(Python Hacking Program)

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:29.740
Should I put it in now?

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.110
No, not yet. It's just...

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.420
Gosh, this is definitely rated R.

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:43.449
- Wait. This is too racy! - What?

00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:45.890
- Is this okay? - I mean, can we even air this?

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.290
What is this?

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.390
It's something you like.

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:50.930
I'm putting it in.

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:52.500
Here it goes.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.970
I know you like it.

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:58.270
I'm putting it in, okay?

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.400
- He's putting it in! He's doing it! - What in the world...

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.410
Gosh. It's fizzing up.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:05.810
Gosh, it's really fizzing up!

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:09.410
- Gosh, look at all those bubbles! - It's a bubble party!

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.110
They're clothed, flirting in a tub, so why is my heart fluttering?

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.050
He's really going all out. This is insane.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.750
- Wait, isn't this getting racy? - Are you okay with this?

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.349
- Oh my gosh. - It's cute.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:19.660
Isn't this a little too much?

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.389
No, it's not. He's leading so well...

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:22.429
- to ensure she's comfortable. - What?

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:23.660
Why would I have a dream like that?

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.130
Okay. It's been a long week,

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.100
and I'm only human, a creature of flesh, blood, and passion.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.309
Meeting him in person, the video's audio,

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.170
and the memory of that darn encounter in Yongsan...

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.580
All these inputs were simply reflected in my dream...

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.909
and supposedly prove the app's theory which is...

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.180
a load of bull!
