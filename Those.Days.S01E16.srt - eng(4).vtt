=Episode 16=

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.826
The dishes are ready.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.919
Alright.

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:24.029
Why hasn't he come yet?

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.248
Who goes on a blind date?

00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:26.248
Why are you so nervous?

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:27.520
The food is all ready.

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:29.839
Get off your photo.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:31.000
Get ready.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.559
I...

00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:33.360
- Hello, madam.
- You're here, Wu.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.479
So nice of you.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.269
You didn't have to bring anything here.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.293
Nice to meet you, madam.

00:01:37.315 --> 00:01:38.390
You too, Wu.

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:39.520
Nice to meet you, Ni.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.479
No.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.440
She's not Ni.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.640
- Nice to meet you, Ni.
- Nice to meet you.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.004
This is my good friend, Mingzhu.

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:45.360
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.039
Wu.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.360
Come. The meal is ready.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.960
Thank you.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.679
We were waiting for you.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.550
You prepared a lot of dishes.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.919
Do you drink?

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:55.515
I'm not much of a drinker.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.279
Then we'll have soft drinks.

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.800
Sure.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.759
That's my father.

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:04.119
I'm so sorry.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.960
But you really do look like him.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.879
I look even more like him in person.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:11.559
Really?

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:13.480
Wu,

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.679
to be honest, life hasn't been easy

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:17.599
for the two of us these years.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.559
Luckily, I have Ni.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.279
She's sensible and capable.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:23.800
She's beautiful too.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.879
That's true.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.839
Madam,

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.159
let me tell you,

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.080
the rainbow comes after the rain.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.399
Don't worry.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.399
In the future,

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.520
I'll treat Ni well.

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:39.439
You two

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.999
can count on me.

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.800
That's the spirit.

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:48.315
You're a responsible young man.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.320
Come. Let's eat.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.109
Sure.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.382
Mom, we're short one soup spoon.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.360
It's fine. I'll get it.

00:02:56.493 --> 00:02:57.760
- I'll go get it.
- Alright.

00:02:57.782 --> 00:02:58.550
Be careful.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.599
You're pregnant.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.839
Dad,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.599
we're starting lunch.

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:05.760
Come.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.800
Let's dig in.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.439
Ni,

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.760
I'm not one

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.760
for beating around the bush.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.599
We're both not young anymore.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.080
I'll say it straight.

00:03:16.293 --> 00:03:17.390
You don't mind, do you?

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.839
No, not at all.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.999
Why would she mind? Go ahead.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.960
I told her

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.879
we should eat out.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.760
Our place is too small.

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:27.719
But she insisted we eat at home.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.119
At least he can recognize our home.

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:31.159
Right.

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:32.240
This isn't small.

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.439
My old home used to be smaller.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.559
Madam,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.240
I came from a poor background too.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.480
What a humble lad.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.640
See how humble Wu is?

00:03:45.248 --> 00:03:46.320
He doesn't look down on

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.360
our old house at all.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.920
Unlike Mingzhu's mother-in-law,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.320
she always holds her head high.

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:55.119
What's the word again?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.040
Ungrateful.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.760
Alright, Mom.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.800
I know what that means.

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:59.760
Madam, let me tell you.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.760
Those people who look down on others

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.999
are just full of themselves.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.480
Look at me. My family has six houses.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.920
Six houses.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.879
And I still take the bus.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.960
You're just low-key.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.200
A person should be low-key.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.799
That's character.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.760
How nice.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.599
Here.

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.440
Try some of my beef.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.680
See if you like it.

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.000
How is it?

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.039
It's delicious.

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:27.880
This is

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.399
even better than my mom's.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.680
Try this.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.080
Ni made the scrambled eggs
with tomatoes.

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:38.960
You can cook?

00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:43.440
Girls who can cook these days

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.520
are rare.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.719
Do I deserve those six houses of yours?

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.000
Ni.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.760
Ni likes to tell jokes.

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.120
But madam,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.640
my parents told me before I came.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.640
Let's make it clear first.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.960
It's true we have six houses,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.520
but they're all

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.359
under my parents' name.

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.120
But don't worry.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.520
If we get married,

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.279
they'll give us one.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.799
If we have one child,
they'll give us another.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.799
If we have two, we'll get one more.

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:25.159
Fair enough, right?

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:29.919
Your parents sure
have it all figured out.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.389
Sounds fair enough.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.315
Then what if I give birth to
a dozen of them?

00:05:33.315 --> 00:05:35.000
Six houses won't be enough.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.640
That won't work.

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:37.880
My parents said

00:05:37.893 --> 00:05:38.760
three is the limit.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.760
They can't afford more than that.

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.960
It's fine.

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:45.880
If you can't, I'll help raise them.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.719
Get lost!

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.159
Ni Debao!

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:10.039
Do you know

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.039
you're daughter is a spinster now?

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.279
It hasn't been easy
to find someone suitable.

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.000
The young man is honest.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.919
He was so happy.

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.239
Six houses! He's got six houses!

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.080
He likes Ni.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.279
Why do you have to ruin it?

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:24.000
What do you have to ruin everything?

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:25.680
Can't you just stay away?

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:27.760
Why are you carrying joss paper?

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.848
What are you trying to do?

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:30.760
You just knew
you'd drive me crazy today,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.640
didn't you?

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.279
You knew it!

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.359
Don't hit me.

00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:36.039
I just helped out at Di's funeral,

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.440
then Mingzhu texted me

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.640
saying Ni had a date.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.880
So I came to take a look.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.039
Come to take a look?

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.880
Who do you think you are?

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.279
Who are you?

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.560
I'm telling you.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.399
Your portrait is on my wall.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:49.520
You're already dead to me.

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:50.680
I'm begging you.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.320
Just treat me as dead too, okay?

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:54.839
Let's never meet again.

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.799
Can you stop hitting me?

00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:57.640
Get lost.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.080
Stop it.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.239
You always hit me.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.320
Ni Debao,

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:03.320
get back here!

00:07:04.359 --> 00:07:05.719
Get lost! You hear me? Get lost!

00:07:06.204 --> 00:07:07.270
Don't you ever come back.

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:08.320
I'm coming right back.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.239
- Oh, heavens.
- Mom.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.440
I'm so mad.

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:13.599
Easy.

00:07:13.715 --> 00:07:15.760
I guess I have no fate
with those six houses.

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.080
Who do you have fate with?

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.479
You have no fate with anyone who's good.

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:23.839
That's not true.

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:25.029
A few days ago,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.893
someone introduced me
to a physics teacher.

00:07:26.937 --> 00:07:28.320
He's good in every way.

00:07:30.131 --> 00:07:30.760
Really?

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.039
Who introduced you?

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.560
Shen Mingzhu.

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:41.239
All the newlyweds think
Nanxi Hotel is too old,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.640
and they all hold their weddings
at Xincheng Hotel.

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:45.159
Then I thought,

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.680
isn't being old exactly our charm?

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:50.120
Nanxi Hotel has
a hundred years of history.

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:51.799
We can

00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:53.680
make vintage our signature.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.799
That way, we'll stand out

00:07:55.799 --> 00:07:57.039
from hotels like Xincheng.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.320
I'm not into all those fancy ideas.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.200
They take too much time and effort.

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:05.440
Over these days,

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:07.359
we've done fine

00:08:07.582 --> 00:08:09.030
relying on friends and word of mouth.

00:08:10.093 --> 00:08:11.004
Oh right, Mingzhu,

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.640
your cousin's liquor

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:15.239
has been selling really well lately.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.880
You should thank you Mr. Ding.

00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:18.440
Thank you, Mr. Ding.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.719
Mr. Ding,

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.830
if it's too much trouble for you,

00:08:24.137 --> 00:08:25.471
I'd like to give it a try.

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:27.930
If I can help the food and beverage
department boost sales,

00:08:27.937 --> 00:08:29.026
it'd be my pleasure.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.839
Sure.

00:08:31.426 --> 00:08:32.826
As long as it doesn't cost money.

00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:34.137
You can try whatever you want.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:34.879
Sure.

00:08:46.119 --> 00:08:47.119
Let's get started.

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:49.160
What's wrong?

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.119
Don't cry and ruin my makeup.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.599
Relax. Good.

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:54.960
Let's take a test shot.

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:03.320
The ratio's really nice.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.400
Right?

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.604
The pose should be more open.

00:09:05.626 --> 00:09:06.379
Not this one.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.271
That smile is too wide.

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:08.800
Alright.

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:11.320
Who took these for her?

00:09:11.999 --> 00:09:12.680
No idea.

00:09:12.879 --> 00:09:14.160
What does it say on it?

00:09:14.479 --> 00:09:17.400
From newlyweds to golden marriage.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.800
Nanxi Hotel welcomes you.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.400
Golden marriage?

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.382

their golden anniversary there?

her eyes likes yours.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.839
Dacheng,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.359
let me see

00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:45.999
that paternity test result again.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.560
I'm trusting you with this secret.

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:51.119
You mustn't tell anyone.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.719
Don't let Zhixia find out.

00:09:53.719 --> 00:09:54.800
I swear.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.320
I swear I won't tell her.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.400
I won't tell Zhixia.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.519
Let me see.

At home,

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.320
you can play some music

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.160
for your baby.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.471
Alright. Thank you, everyone.

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:30.719
I saw on your Moments

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.693
that your hotel is promoting
wedding banquets.

00:10:32.737 --> 00:10:33.537
Yeah.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.519
My superior isn't really into it.

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:36.469
So my friend and I

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.093
planned some wedding banquet packages.

00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:39.719
We're trying it out ourselves first.

00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:41.680
I'll help advertise for you.

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:42.320
No need.

00:10:43.239 --> 00:10:45.440
I mean, we can't afford the fees.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.839
I told Mr. Ding

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:49.800
I wanted to help promote your hotel.

00:10:51.119 --> 00:10:52.639
And no matter what you think,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.320
we're blood sisters.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.280
We're family.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.680
Family doesn't talk about money.

00:10:58.359 --> 00:10:59.040
Also,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.320
my mom insisted

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:04.280
Zhidong hold his wedding at Nanxi Hotel.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.719
The whole family

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.239
is backing your work.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.119
Zhixia,

00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:11.400
how do I even thank you?

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.080
You don't have to do anything.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.839
When you see Ms. Yu and Mr. Xu,

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.239
just smile.

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:21.160

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.280
Dr. Li.

00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:24.560
You've stopped eating dragon fruit,
haven't you?

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.200
Yeah, not anymore.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:26.999
How's your health?

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160
- Pretty good.
- Dr. Li.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.280
Xu Zhixia.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.719
I'm also your patient.

00:11:33.599 --> 00:11:34.479
This is my sister.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.759
She's Shen Mingzhu?

00:11:39.119 --> 00:11:40.839
Is she also your patient?

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:43.400
Oh, I remember.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.960
Have you eaten?

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.440
I was just about to.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.040
Let's eat together.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.800
We'll treat you.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.519
No, no.

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:50.960
I've been to every restaurant nearby.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960
What do you want to eat?

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.839
No need, really.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.280
Yes. Let's do it another day.

00:11:54.599 --> 00:11:55.560
Don't put it off.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.382
Dr. Li is always busy.

00:11:56.404 --> 00:11:58.570
If we miss this chance,
there might not be a next time.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.293
Today's a good day as any.
Let's do it today.

00:12:00.315 --> 00:12:01.110
Maybe next time.

00:12:01.119 --> 00:12:02.160
Don't be shy.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.840
Throughout your life, when you're born,
it's a doctor who delivers you.

00:12:05.848 --> 00:12:07.280
When you're sick,
it's a doctor who treats you.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.226
When you die,
it's a doctor who sends you off.

00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:10.960
So you've got
to be friends with doctors.

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:13.759
A friend for life.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.759
A friend throughout life.

00:12:16.293 --> 00:12:17.826
Your sister sure has a way with words.

00:12:17.826 --> 00:12:19.710
Yeah. She's a content writer.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.960
No wonder.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.800
Once we sit down,

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.639
I'll give you a proper introduction.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.519
What do you like to eat?

00:12:25.599 --> 00:12:27.800
Barbecue, hotpot, or Huaiyang cuisine?

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.800
How about this?

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.080
I'll take you to the canteen.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.648
I have an appointment this afternoon.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:32.960
- Is that okay?
- It's fine.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.680
Sure. We can try that.

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:35.960
Then you treat this time,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.839
and next time we will.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.119
Sure. Let's go.

00:12:38.119 --> 00:12:38.920
Come.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.719
Follow me.

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:41.719
Are we really going?

00:12:42.239 --> 00:12:43.400
Be friends with doctors, okay?

00:12:43.719 --> 00:12:44.239
Come.

00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:45.599
I'll have you some. I can't finish.

00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:46.599
I don't eat meat.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.080
You can't skip meat.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.239
You're carrying a baby now.

00:12:49.239 --> 00:12:49.759
Here.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.350
- Have some soup.
- Thank you.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.999
You're welcome.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.630
The food at your hospital
is pretty good.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:55.519
Yeah.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.599
They feed us well

00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:00.040
so we can work hard.

00:13:02.119 --> 00:13:02.800
Oh, right.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.629
What happened

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.248
with the medical brawl last time?

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:07.639
No idea.

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:08.960
I haven't seen them lately.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.599
I guess it's finally dying down.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:11.719
That's good.

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:13.040
You do smile?

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.359
Last time I saw him,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.239
he was so serious.

00:13:17.239 --> 00:13:18.759
Totally deadpan.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.920
I'm at work. I have to be serious.

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:23.839
So when you're off work,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.080
do you smile a lot? You seem cheerful.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.239
Not really.

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:28.719
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.639
This eggplant is good.

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:36.800
Yeah, it is.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.560
Zhixia, try some.

00:13:40.471 --> 00:13:41.230
It's really nice.

00:13:41.239 --> 00:13:41.759
Right?

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.119
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:13:47.719 --> 00:13:49.320
I had one, and then

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.359
I got cheated on.

00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:00.479
It's fine. It's all in the past.

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:02.479
Well.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.239
Add me on WeChat.

00:14:04.648 --> 00:14:05.990
I'll introduce you to someone nice.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:12.999
I'll scan you.

00:14:16.599 --> 00:14:17.759
I didn't know.

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:20.239
It's fine. He's a man.

00:14:21.119 --> 00:14:22.680
Can't let one bad apple

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.719
scare him off forever.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.040
Right.

00:14:26.119 --> 00:14:26.639
Yes.

00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:39.999
Zhidong.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.800
Zhidong.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.080
Your breakfast is ready.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.519
Eggs are in the pot.

00:14:46.839 --> 00:14:48.160
Boiled eggs again?

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.639
Where are you going so early?

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.310
I'm going to buy groceries.

00:14:52.315 --> 00:14:53.160
That early?

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:55.893
The vegetables are freshest
in the morning market.

00:14:55.893 --> 00:14:57.493
Didn't you always go for the cheap ones

00:14:57.493 --> 00:14:58.400
and leftovers?

00:14:59.359 --> 00:15:01.160
Why do you always say
such useless things?

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:04.280
I'm cooking for you and your dad,

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.599
not feeding dogs.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:14.680
Dad.

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.839
Eggs give enough protein,

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.440
but the diet isn't balanced.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.080
There's rice and food in the fridge.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.759
Can you make me some rice soup?

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.599
Zhidong,

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.759
I'm busy. Make it yourself.

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:32.560
Where are you going?

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.440
Your second sister's family
runs a restaurant.

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:37.800
I'm getting them some fresh ingredients.

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:40.320
They have suppliers.

00:15:40.599 --> 00:15:41.839
What's it got to do with you?

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:43.080
That's my effort.

00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:46.080
You're unbelievable.

00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:52.759
Zhidong dear, good morning.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.004
I bought you jianbing guozi
and sweet soy milk.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.400
My Princess Chen is the best.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.080
See you later.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.839
Mingzhu.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.839
You should eat less staple food.

00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:08.440
Watch your weight.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.839
You can't gain too fast.

00:16:10.599 --> 00:16:11.320
Okay?

00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:12.759
Eat more greens.

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:13.839
Tomatoes. Eat this.

00:16:15.479 --> 00:16:16.479
Mom, I'm done.

00:16:16.599 --> 00:16:17.719
I'm going to work now.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.280
Wait.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.239
The wind is strong.

00:16:20.599 --> 00:16:21.680
Meiqi will give you a ride.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.320
I can't.

00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:23.960
Hu Gang will pick me up later.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.560
No need.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.800
I can walk. It's convenient.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.800
I can do exercise.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.080
I'm off.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.382
- Take your time.
- Alright.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.440
Be careful on the road.

00:16:32.519 --> 00:16:33.080
Okay.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:36.839
Slowly.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.479
What's wrong with you, Feng Meiqi?

00:16:41.479 --> 00:16:43.239
Why won't you listen to anything I say?

00:16:45.719 --> 00:16:46.999
Mingzhu's pregnant.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.999
We should pay more attention to her.

00:16:49.999 --> 00:16:52.519
Your care is overflowing.

00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:53.239
Overflowing where?

00:16:53.239 --> 00:16:53.999
Can't you see

00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:55.599
she wants some alone time?

00:16:55.599 --> 00:16:57.080
I don't see it.

00:16:57.239 --> 00:16:58.160
You're biased.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.280
How is that?

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.680
You only care about Mingzhu.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.239
I need care too.

00:17:02.239 --> 00:17:03.440
Why wouldn't I care about you?

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.680
She's pregnant.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.160
She's carrying your brother's child.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.069
Are you pregnant?

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:08.160
I'll get pregnant too.

00:17:08.315 --> 00:17:09.071
Say that again.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:10.759
Go get the door.

00:17:11.279 --> 00:17:11.880
I'm not going.

00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:17.920
Coming.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.479
Where's Ms. Mao?

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.039
I haven't seen her this morning.

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:25.915
It's you, Hu Gang.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.880
Good morning, Mrs. Feng.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.559
Meiqi is having breakfast.

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:29.880
I'll be quick.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.799
No rush, Meiqi.

00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:33.360
You have seven minutes.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.400
Why don't you come in and wait?

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.493
No thanks, Mrs. Feng.

00:17:39.493 --> 00:17:40.360
I'll wait here.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.600
Hu Gang,

00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:44.600
I think

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.999
you should get a driving license.

00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:48.680
Don't ride scooters.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.559
They are dangerous.

00:17:49.719 --> 00:17:51.400
Mrs. Feng, I've signed up.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.160
In thirteen days,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.279
I'll have it.

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:54.719
That's quick.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.680
- Good.
- See?

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.039
Teachers are different.

00:17:57.039 --> 00:17:58.239
He's so precise.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.239
Meiqi,

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.640
six more minutes for you.

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:23.200
Mingzhu.

00:18:24.315 --> 00:18:25.537
Are you heading to work?

00:18:25.582 --> 00:18:26.248
You...

00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:27.039
I...

00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:29.039
I came here to buy groceries.

00:18:30.239 --> 00:18:31.600
Have you had breakfast?

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.840
I boiled eggs.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.880
Take one.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.799
I already ate.

00:18:34.999 --> 00:18:35.759
Well, you...

00:18:36.319 --> 00:18:37.999
My mom and my mother-in-law

00:18:37.999 --> 00:18:40.239
make me lots of breakfast every day.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.200
This is different.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.079
These are free-range eggs.

00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:46.079
It's nutritious.

00:18:46.079 --> 00:18:47.239
Take it.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.999
Alright. I'll eat it when I'm hungry.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.600
Okay.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:53.960
Right.

00:18:54.519 --> 00:18:57.680
How's your morning sickness?

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.559
Are you throwing up?

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:01.920
No. I'm feeling fine.

00:19:03.479 --> 00:19:04.600
That's good.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:05.759
Good.

00:19:07.999 --> 00:19:09.519
I'm off to work.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:10.960
Okay.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.479
Go ahead.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.680
By the way,

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.200
I asked an old TCM physician

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.680
about a home remedy.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.400
When a pregnant woman

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.680
has a poor appetite,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.960
she can drink fried rice water.

00:19:24.239 --> 00:19:25.360
I made some

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.360
for you

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.400
and brought it.

00:19:28.759 --> 00:19:30.279
When you feel unwell,

00:19:30.719 --> 00:19:32.400
brew a little and try it.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.400
Thank you.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.120
You're welcome.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.279
You don't have to thank me.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:43.999
Say,

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.960
you're pregnant

00:19:46.759 --> 00:19:47.719
and alone.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.279
If anything comes up,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.279
tell your family.

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:54.160
I will.

00:19:55.693 --> 00:19:56.200
Well, I...

00:19:58.279 --> 00:19:59.920
I'm keeping you from work.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.039
Hurry.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.479
Hurry, go on.

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:03.680
Go.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.920
Be careful.

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:22.160
Zhixia, would you like coffee or tea?

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:22.880
No thanks.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.200
Have a seat.

00:20:27.319 --> 00:20:28.559
Are you here to take credit?

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.279
Of course.

00:20:30.493 --> 00:20:32.804
Your "Meimei" series sold
over twenty thousand pieces

00:20:32.804 --> 00:20:34.026
through my public account.

00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:35.360
You know what?

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.600
You're amazing.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.759
All our counters combined

00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:39.079
didn't sell that many.

00:20:39.079 --> 00:20:39.840
Of course.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.519
We're doing precision marketing.

00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:44.039
By the way, Sam,

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.999
push your accountant

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.200
to settle the promotion fee.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.319
I'm counting on that money
to have my baby.

00:20:50.319 --> 00:20:51.479
Right away.

00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:52.880
I'm doing it now.

00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:56.479
Zhou,

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.160
hurry and process

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.200
Zhixia's promotion payment.

00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:01.319
Just say it's from me.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.840
Thanks.

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:05.160
No need to be so formal.

00:21:05.519 --> 00:21:06.120
Zhixia.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.559
This is our new series

00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:11.120
called Blossom.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.559
The price will be a bit higher,

00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:15.519
but the colors are rich.

00:21:15.519 --> 00:21:17.360
Perfect for mature women.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.999
How about this?

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.079
Anything bought through

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:23.210
Zhixia's public account will
be priced at fifty-eight.

00:21:23.759 --> 00:21:25.479
Okay. No problem.

00:21:25.999 --> 00:21:26.719
I'll promote it.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.989
Don't leave yet, Zhixia.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.200
Let's have lunch together.
I've reserved a private room.

00:21:31.239 --> 00:21:32.120
I can't.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.719
I have another interview after this.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.400
You're so dedicated.

00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:36.479
Of course.

00:21:36.479 --> 00:21:37.360
If I slacked off,

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.137
would your payment get processed
this fast?

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:39.880
Hey.

00:21:53.519 --> 00:21:54.319
Why are you here?

00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:56.719
I brought you big carp.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.039
Look.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.799
My restaurant has all kinds of dishes.

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:01.719
Take them home.

00:22:01.719 --> 00:22:03.200
I got them especially for you.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.079
You can add another dish to your menu.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:05.999
Braised carp.

00:22:05.999 --> 00:22:07.200
Look, they're fresh.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.279
Take them home.

00:22:08.519 --> 00:22:09.479
Don't be shy.

00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:10.719
Shen,

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.279
you did me a big favor.

00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:13.759
I asked around.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.920
The fine was three thousand.

00:22:15.999 --> 00:22:17.479
If it weren't for your contacts,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.400
I'd have paid three thousand.

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.039
No big deal.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.719
How's Mingzhu?

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.160
She's fine.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.920
I can't talk to you now.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.289
I need to prepare the ingredients.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:30.960
Sure. Off you go.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.960
Just go ahead.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.719
Take it home.

00:22:33.079 --> 00:22:33.840
No.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.640
Don't worry about me.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.559
Put it here.

00:22:35.759 --> 00:22:36.400
I'm off.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.759
Go do your thing.

00:22:42.239 --> 00:22:42.999
Be careful.

00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:48.600
I'm off.

00:23:12.239 --> 00:23:12.880
Look.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.360
How lively they are.

00:23:17.719 --> 00:23:18.999
Where did you get so many fish?

00:23:19.759 --> 00:23:20.479
Wang

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.960
was clearing his pond.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.039
The fish looked good,

00:23:23.479 --> 00:23:24.279
so I bought a lot.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.470
Why did you buy so many?

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.530
You'll be selling them
through the Chinese New Year.

00:23:30.039 --> 00:23:31.120
You've got no sense.

00:23:31.759 --> 00:23:32.840
Oh my.

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:36.039
These fish will be gone in a few days.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.360
If not, I'll keep them in a tank.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.999
What's wrong with you
early in the morning?

00:23:45.999 --> 00:23:48.479
You get worked up

00:23:48.999 --> 00:23:50.200
and sound harsh.

00:24:02.626 --> 00:24:04.604
I went to the morning market
to buy groceries

00:24:04.671 --> 00:24:06.360
this morning.

00:24:07.319 --> 00:24:08.279
Guess who I saw.

00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:09.440
Who?

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.640
That Yu woman.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.759
She must've timed it

00:24:14.999 --> 00:24:16.680
and waited there for Mingzhu.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.840
She was holding two eggs.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.920
Two eggs?

00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:25.440
It's not about the eggs.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.160
Don't you get what she meant?

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.680
It was on purpose.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.160
Listen.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.079
Starting tomorrow,

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.559
you'll escort Mingzhu

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.920
to work.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.600
Got it?

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:41.960
I have to pick her up after work too?

00:24:42.319 --> 00:24:43.400
Of course.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.319
Don't overthink it.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.960
If she wants to see Mingzhu,

00:24:49.239 --> 00:24:50.200
she can do it anytime

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.680
other than before or after work.

00:24:52.026 --> 00:24:53.310
You can't keep Mingzhu tied

00:24:53.319 --> 00:24:54.440
to your waistband all day.

00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:56.048
Who's going to run the business then?

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.759
Stop worrying so much.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.719
Eat.

00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:06.680
No.

00:25:07.204 --> 00:25:08.550
I need to think of a plan.

00:25:09.319 --> 00:25:11.039
I'll settle her once and for all.

00:25:14.559 --> 00:25:16.759
Mom, I don't want to eat eggs.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.039
Eggs are nutritious.

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:19.920
If you eat eggs,

00:25:19.999 --> 00:25:21.960
you'll grow taller,

00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:23.079
right?

00:25:24.479 --> 00:25:25.039
You know what?

00:25:25.039 --> 00:25:27.200
One bite of egg,
one bite of pickled veggies.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.600
It's nice to eat them together.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.160
Try it.

00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:33.360
Good girl.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.600
Have some pickles.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.479
Grandma,

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.079
can you tell me

00:25:53.239 --> 00:25:55.160
about your love story with Grandpa?

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.680
Recall your youthful days.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.200
Hand in hand

00:26:04.848 --> 00:26:05.960
and growing old together.

00:26:09.079 --> 00:26:09.719
Well.

00:26:09.719 --> 00:26:10.799
Can you tell me

00:26:11.079 --> 00:26:12.840
how you two met?

00:26:15.239 --> 00:26:16.319
How did we meet?

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.200
He tricked me into marriage, you know?

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.319
Tricked you?

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.400
My family was poor back then.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.640
He said his family had
two yellow croakers,

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.714
so I believed him.

00:26:27.715 --> 00:26:29.400
After I married him,
I found out they were

00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:30.440
colored fish.

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:31.559
He was a fraud.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.160
What's wrong with you?

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.759
Mom, is the spin cycle
on the washing machine

00:26:37.759 --> 00:26:38.799
broken?

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.759
Why use the washing machine

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.680
for a few clothes?

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.440
Our country's water

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.719
is precious.

00:26:45.999 --> 00:26:47.079
We have to save

00:26:48.079 --> 00:26:49.719
every drop.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.799
The water is everywhere.

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:54.440
If I slip,

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:55.960
it's not worth it.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.440
Stop preaching.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.710
Grandma, let me help you.

00:26:59.719 --> 00:27:00.920
Careful.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.039
Preaching?

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.239
Be careful.

00:27:05.239 --> 00:27:05.719
Alright.

00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:08.799
There's still a long way to go
in changing old mindsets.

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:10.999
Age grows,

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.999
but awareness doesn't.

00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:20.640
Mom,

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.920
I've been helping Nanxi Hotel

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.079
write an advertisement.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.479
Zhang Hao told me

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.400
you and Dad

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.360
got married at Nanxi Hotel.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.600
How was it?

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:31.680
Not great.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.440
Just hearing Nanxi Hotel

00:27:36.479 --> 00:27:37.719
makes me angry.

00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:49.360
Zhang and I married for love.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.360
But his parents

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.400
didn't approve.

00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:56.239
Halfway through the wedding banquet,

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.120
they just walked out.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.519
No one paid the bill.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.479
Zhang left me at Nanxi Hotel

00:28:03.479 --> 00:28:06.640
and went home to ask his parents
for wedding money.

00:28:08.479 --> 00:28:10.200
Anyway, just one word.

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:12.120
Tragic.

00:28:15.239 --> 00:28:16.079
Even if

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.559
it's old history,

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:21.239
you should still tell the truth.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.600
Zhixia,

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.640
you're doing publicity,

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:25.559
right?

00:28:25.559 --> 00:28:28.239
You have to write the whole story,

00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:30.440
not just sing praises.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.239
You must show

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:35.120
the people's

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.840
joys and sorrows.

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.200
Make it profound.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.239
Mom, I'll help you with the clothes.

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:42.079
No need.

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:45.759
Come.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.559
Sit.

00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:53.719
You should be more careful now.

00:28:55.559 --> 00:28:57.999
The floor is wet.

00:28:57.999 --> 00:28:59.880
Yes, I can mop it.

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:04.200
I'll get a mop.

00:29:05.519 --> 00:29:06.279
Mom,

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:08.960
wring the clothes dryer
before you lay them out.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.440
It's fine.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.799
I can just mop it.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.279
One mop and it won't be slippery.

00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:15.479
Lift your feet.

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:15.920
Yes.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.960
Good.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.999
Look. Problem solved.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.020
(20 percent off after 8 PM)

00:29:56.039 --> 00:29:56.440
Hello.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.840
Hi. Bill, please.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.400
Just one minute.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.200
I missed Jiao's favorite

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.719
chocolate donut,

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.920
so I bought a strawberry donut.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.160
Anyway,

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.039
they're both donuts.

00:30:27.999 --> 00:30:29.360
We're human.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.550
Are we the same though?

00:30:31.519 --> 00:30:32.400
I'm pregnant,

00:30:32.719 --> 00:30:34.120
working my fingers to the bone.

00:30:34.759 --> 00:30:37.360
You're in slippers,
fighting over discounted bread.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.039
You're nitpicking.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.799
That one minute saved a few yuan.

00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:43.999
Jiao.

00:30:45.999 --> 00:30:47.960
I bought you a donut.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.999
Is strawberry okay?

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:51.200
Okay.

00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:52.920
Enjoy.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.880
Look at her.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.880
My daughter is so sensible.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.360
Poor kids grow up fast.

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:06.319
That's not necessarily bad.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.759
The new hires at work

00:31:08.759 --> 00:31:10.279
all have high standards but low skills.

00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:11.960
They've had it too easy.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.440
You went through a lot as a kid,

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.559
yet you still chase discounts.

00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:21.200
Are you in a bad mood?

00:31:28.719 --> 00:31:29.479
I may be poor,

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.239
but I've got dignity.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.840
I don't eat discounted cake.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.920
This isn't discounted.

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:36.799
I paid full price for it.

00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:38.039
Jiao's donut is discounted.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.039
Jiao!

00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:40.160
Jiao, sturdy hard.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:40.920
Hey.

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:45.840
What happened?

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:48.239
Did the interview with the Zhang family

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:49.160
not go well?

00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:54.920
Zhang left me at Nanxi Hotel

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.079
and went home to ask his parents
for the wedding money.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.880
Anyway, just one word.

00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:01.640
Tragic.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.200
I told you not to go.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.039
You insisted.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.319
I'm trying to write credible articles.

00:32:09.337 --> 00:32:11.060
I thought three generations
in your family

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.360
had their wedding at Nanxi Hotel.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.880
They're perfect interview material.

00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:16.360
Who knew those two generations
had so many stories?

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.999
Scam and tragedy.

00:32:18.999 --> 00:32:20.400
But look at the result.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.400
The older generations didn't have love,

00:32:24.279 --> 00:32:25.360
but they worked hard

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.960
and made it through.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.279
My grandparents

00:32:28.719 --> 00:32:30.279
bickered a lot

00:32:30.293 --> 00:32:31.750
and yet still cared about each other.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:32.804
Same with my parents.

00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:33.960
I didn't even meet your dad.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.680
I wouldn't know.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.840
Yes, my dad died young.

00:32:36.239 --> 00:32:37.279
We're the same.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.279
Even though you yell and hit me,

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:43.400
don't I still love you?

00:32:45.799 --> 00:32:46.759
How should I write it?

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.200
I can only let my imagination run.

00:32:50.239 --> 00:32:50.920
Exactly.

00:32:51.559 --> 00:32:53.519
That's the way you write it.

00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:54.880
Write it like this.

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:56.559
"My grandparents

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.309
were a quarrelsome couple.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.271
My parents were comrades
who went through a lot.

00:33:00.293 --> 00:33:01.550
We are a perfect match.

00:33:01.559 --> 00:33:04.440
Three generations tied the knot
at Nanxi Hotel.

00:33:04.519 --> 00:33:06.559
We've been unbelievably happy.

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:07.880
Life's on a roll.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.029
Wealth keeps rolling in.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.890
Fantastic. That's how we roll."
What do you think?

00:33:10.893 --> 00:33:12.310
Zhang Hao,

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.137
you're cut out
for being a department head.

00:33:14.239 --> 00:33:15.719
Your mouth can spin tall tales.

00:33:15.719 --> 00:33:16.999
What tall tales?

00:33:18.519 --> 00:33:20.880
When we first met, we rented a place.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.400
Now we've bought a house.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.200
Back then we rode bikes.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.960
Now we use shared bikes,

00:33:26.279 --> 00:33:27.519
and you even bought a car.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.039
Isn't that the money rolling in?

00:33:32.319 --> 00:33:33.039
Rolling in.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.239
Feeling inspired?

00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:43.920
Come. Have a bite.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.239
Leave me alone.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.360
One ceremony, two lovers,

00:33:59.448 --> 00:34:00.880
and a group of friends and family.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.319
Hand in hand, they toast the guests.

00:34:04.479 --> 00:34:07.440
Face to face,
they promise each other a lifetime.

00:34:07.999 --> 00:34:09.720
Those newlyweds who tied the knot

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.119
at Nanxi Hotel back then

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:13.360
are now parents

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:14.840
and grandparents.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.679
The blushing bride

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:19.240
has become the heart of a family.

00:34:20.039 --> 00:34:23.199
Nanxi Hotel, the perfect place
for wedding banquets.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:24.159
Jiao,

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:25.920
have your milk.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.440
What are you doing?

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.360
Make that vow, and it's for life.

00:34:36.559 --> 00:34:37.400
Happiness.

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.760
It's kind of gross.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.760
Jiao,

00:34:41.337 --> 00:34:42.990
what are you doing?
Don't touch my things.

00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:44.079
What happened?

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.559
What's going on?

00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:46.960
I was trying the color.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.039
These are things I need for work.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:51.880
I didn't know that.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.880
You could've asked.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.240
Alright.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:53.920
What's under your nose?

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.559
Alright.

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:55.280
Jiao,

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.320
go wash it off.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.240
Hurry.

00:34:57.519 --> 00:34:58.159
Wait.

00:34:58.559 --> 00:34:59.199
Why did you

00:34:59.199 --> 00:35:00.400
touch my things?

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.479
Wash it off.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.840
Don't be angry.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.204
Pregnant women can't get angry.

00:35:04.226 --> 00:35:05.471
Pregnant women can't get angry.

00:35:05.519 --> 00:35:06.280
I'm pregnant.

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:07.089
You can't be angry.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:07.720
I can't be angry.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.280
Breathe in.

00:35:08.648 --> 00:35:09.280
Breathe out.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:09.960
Compensate me.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:12.840
Zhang Hao,

00:35:13.048 --> 00:35:14.470
those lipsticks aren't expensive,

00:35:14.999 --> 00:35:16.440
but they cost fifty-eight yuan each.

00:35:16.479 --> 00:35:17.479
There are twenty of them.

00:35:17.479 --> 00:35:18.400
Do the math.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.320
1,160.

00:35:19.893 --> 00:35:21.560
Your daughter caused the damage.

00:35:21.671 --> 00:35:22.804
You pay me back.

00:35:23.559 --> 00:35:25.479
Pay me so I can buy new ones.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:28.999
That's not much.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.559
But strictly speaking,

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.999
she's our daughter.

00:35:35.079 --> 00:35:36.280
Can we split the money?

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.599
Seriously, Zhang Hao?

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.030
You want to split the money
over something your child broke?

00:35:45.671 --> 00:35:47.550
Then we'll split everything
in the house too.

00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:48.920
No, that's not what I mean.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.004
I didn't mean it like that.

00:35:50.026 --> 00:35:51.990
I wanted to pay it all,
but I don't have money.

00:35:51.999 --> 00:35:52.559
No money?

00:35:52.626 --> 00:35:54.871
Then how can you talk about
having a second child?

00:36:16.199 --> 00:36:17.479
I swear that's all I have.

00:36:20.119 --> 00:36:20.880
Zhang Hao.

00:36:23.559 --> 00:36:25.559
Is this your secret stash?

00:36:28.159 --> 00:36:29.029
You came

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.937
after reading Zhixia's
public account post too?

00:36:30.937 --> 00:36:31.960
Yes. We were thinking of

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.479
having a modern Chinese wedding,

00:36:33.479 --> 00:36:34.519
so we came to take a look.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.039
That's perfect then.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.159
Look, the corridor here

00:36:38.159 --> 00:36:40.159
is lined with decades-old
osmanthus trees.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.679
You can take photos

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:42.960
right under them.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.679
Surrounded by osmanthus trees

00:36:44.679 --> 00:36:46.479
and your Chinese-style bridal gown.

00:36:46.479 --> 00:36:48.760
That's the most popular
modern Chinese style now.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.648
It's guaranteed to look amazing
in photos.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.840
Over there

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.360
is outdoor area.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.069
You can invite your family and friends

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.669
to drink tea and relax under the trees.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:58.440
We'll make sure
they're well taken care of.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.440
That one.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.880
That's our Daughter Pagoda.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.320
I like that pagoda.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.679
The Daughter Pagoda

00:37:04.679 --> 00:37:07.159
isn't usually open for banquets.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.800
It's only decorated

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.800
and opened on wedding days

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.559
as a blessing for the newlyweds.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.960
That's Nanxi Hotel's long tradition.

00:37:15.071 --> 00:37:17.293
Nanxi Hotel truly deserves
to be called an old brand.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.039
Full of stories.

00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:18.760
That's right.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.509
For old local folks,

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.248
holding a wedding banquet at Nanxi Hotel
is a sign of prestige.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.840
It's nice,

00:37:25.039 --> 00:37:26.880
but the hotel has never been renovated.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.840
It's a bit dated.

00:37:28.071 --> 00:37:29.800
You don't have to worry about that.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.679
We have a professional
wedding planning team,

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.159
makeup artists, and decorations.

00:37:33.159 --> 00:37:34.360
The final result is beautiful.

00:37:34.426 --> 00:37:35.671
I have some sample photos here.

00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:36.440
Have a look.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.360
This one is French vintage style.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.320
This one is 1980s retro.

00:37:40.999 --> 00:37:43.320
And here are the matching
bridal makeup looks.

00:37:43.519 --> 00:37:45.119
This is really nice, right?

00:37:46.119 --> 00:37:47.760
Why don't we book Nanxi Hotel?

00:37:49.559 --> 00:37:50.320
Your call.

00:37:50.999 --> 00:37:51.559
Miss Shen,

00:37:51.559 --> 00:37:52.559
we'll book it.

00:37:52.559 --> 00:37:54.039
Sure. This way, please.

00:37:54.039 --> 00:37:54.559
Okay.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.360
Shen.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.720
Come here, Shen.

00:38:01.999 --> 00:38:02.720
What again?

00:38:03.159 --> 00:38:03.800
Hurry.

00:38:12.199 --> 00:38:12.999
Look at this.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.280
A century-old hotel.
Wedding banquets across three generations.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.519
Look at the author.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.826
It was written by the eldest daughter
of the Xu family?

00:38:22.559 --> 00:38:23.479
What did I tell you?

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.920
There's not a single good one
in that family.

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:28.280
They're trying to slowly influence

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.840
our daughter.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.240
Influence?

00:38:31.426 --> 00:38:33.271
Why don't you say
they're infiltrating us?

00:38:33.582 --> 00:38:34.960
In that case, I should check

00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:37.039
if we've got
any undercover agents in our home.

00:38:37.199 --> 00:38:37.840
Listen.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.720
Mingzhu's soft-hearted.

00:38:39.871 --> 00:38:42.448
How can she handle them
pushing and sweet-talking her like that?

00:38:43.639 --> 00:38:44.440
So you're worried

00:38:45.079 --> 00:38:46.320
she won't stand her ground?

00:38:46.639 --> 00:38:47.679
Exactly.

00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:49.679
I'm telling you.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.320
If that Yu woman dares to play tricks,

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.039
I'll make her regret it.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:01.880
Zhi...

00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:03.119
Dacheng,

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.400
hang the clothes out

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.559
to dry.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.760
Zhidong.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.440
Are you up yet, Zhidong?

00:39:09.199 --> 00:39:09.920
Let me see.

00:39:10.199 --> 00:39:11.199
Oh my. That boy.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.039
Hurry up. We're running late.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.039
Coming.

00:39:16.639 --> 00:39:18.760
We're buying wedding candies,
not catching a flight.

00:39:19.199 --> 00:39:21.915
Mom, didn't you say we could order
the wedding candy online?

00:39:21.937 --> 00:39:23.248
Why must we go to the market?

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.519
They said

00:39:24.519 --> 00:39:26.840
the good stuff is only sold
in the morning market.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.840
If you go late,

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.800
they close up.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.280
Hurry.

00:39:32.559 --> 00:39:33.519
I'm taking this.

00:39:33.519 --> 00:39:33.920
Okay.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.840
Get on the scooter outside.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.199
Okay.

00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:37.240
Hurry up.

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:45.950
Where should I pull over?

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.190
Pull over here. Hurry up.

00:39:47.199 --> 00:39:48.479
Stop.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.679
I don't have time.

00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:51.479
I'm late.

00:39:51.479 --> 00:39:52.240
Careful.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:52.999
Wait, you...

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.999
Listen to me.

00:39:55.159 --> 00:39:56.720
We split up.

00:39:57.079 --> 00:39:58.760
You go to Mr. Liu's shop

00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.800
and buy rice and flour.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.629
I'll go buy wedding candy.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.004
I don't know how to buy that stuff.

00:40:04.004 --> 00:40:04.880
Just tell him

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.599
I ordered it in advance.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.519
After we're done,

00:40:08.519 --> 00:40:09.639
we'll text on WeChat.

00:40:09.639 --> 00:40:10.039
Okay.

00:40:10.039 --> 00:40:10.920
Alright. I'm off.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.519
Mingzhu.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.280
On your way to work?

00:40:23.582 --> 00:40:24.880
You came here to buy groceries?

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.679
No.

00:40:25.679 --> 00:40:27.679
I'm not buying groceries today.

00:40:27.679 --> 00:40:29.280
I came here to buy wedding candy.

00:40:30.039 --> 00:40:31.760
Zhidong is getting married.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.240
We decided

00:40:33.559 --> 00:40:35.079
to hold the banquet at your hotel.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.079
We'd like to help you
make a good impression

00:40:38.079 --> 00:40:39.280
on your superior.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.920
I know.

00:40:41.039 --> 00:40:42.039
Thank you.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.240
I'll ask for a good discount

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.920
from my superior.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:54.920
Mingzhu.

00:40:57.599 --> 00:40:59.920
The way you smile

00:41:00.679 --> 00:41:02.800
looks exactly like Zhidong.

00:41:06.944 --> 00:41:07.840
Mingzhu.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.999
Mom is so sorry.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.400
I'm so sorry.

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:16.999
What are you trying to do, Yu?

00:41:18.999 --> 00:41:19.440
No.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.479
I...

00:41:20.479 --> 00:41:22.760
I happened to

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.760
run into Mingzhu here.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.599
We just said hi.

00:41:26.599 --> 00:41:27.760
Just a casual hello.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.320
A casual hello?

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:29.960
Yes.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.039
Came here to steal her again?

00:41:31.039 --> 00:41:31.840
No.

00:41:31.871 --> 00:41:33.590
You gave birth to her,
then threw her away.

00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:34.039
No.

00:41:34.039 --> 00:41:35.840
And now you want to
pick her back up for free?

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.626
No, it's not that.

00:41:36.648 --> 00:41:38.440
I'm telling you, Mingzhu said

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.471
she only has one mother.

00:41:39.471 --> 00:41:40.150
And that's me.

00:41:40.159 --> 00:41:41.079
Yes, only you.

00:41:41.079 --> 00:41:43.840
We just happened to run into each other.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.880
Run into each other?

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.440
She comes by here every day.

00:41:46.559 --> 00:41:47.639
I've seen it.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.519
She even brought two eggs.

00:41:49.519 --> 00:41:50.119
How funny.

00:41:50.119 --> 00:41:51.240
As if we can't afford eggs.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:51.880
No, you can.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.639
Let's go, Mom.

00:41:52.639 --> 00:41:53.400
- Let's go.
- No.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.720
We'll make this clear today.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.519
No one's leaving.

00:41:55.519 --> 00:41:57.440
It's getting late.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.400
Let Mingzhu go to work.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.360
Yeah, Mom.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.639
I have to work.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.159
Whose side are you on?

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.920
Ungrateful child.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.240
This woman abandoned you.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.079
She gave you away.

00:42:08.079 --> 00:42:08.920
Do you know?

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.400
No, it's not that.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.119
You can't say it like that.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.039
My mother gave Mingzhu to you

00:42:16.039 --> 00:42:17.440
behind my back.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.720
When I gave birth to her,
I hemorrhaged badly.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.800
I was in the hospital.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.639
I nearly died.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.199
I honestly knew

00:42:24.199 --> 00:42:26.800
nothing at all.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.599
My mother later told me

00:42:28.599 --> 00:42:30.800
she gave you an address.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.599
She said

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:34.320
the couple who adopted the baby

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.199
promised

00:42:35.199 --> 00:42:38.119
to bring the child back to visit us.

00:42:38.119 --> 00:42:40.079
But you never came.

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:42.679
My mother couldn't close her eyes
even when she passed.
