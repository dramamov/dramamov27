ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:36.345
You again.

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:38.385
I just wanted to greet a friend.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:39.985
How did you find this place?

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:41.985
Other than the quarry,

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:43.745
I also saw Zhong Lin change her clothes

00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:45.185
and met with His Highness's subordinates.

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:48.665
I was bored so I asked around

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:50.905
and deduced where both of you would be.

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:52.345
Then, I came to pick you up.

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:02.705
I saw you both come out
of His Highness's manor

00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:05.625
whilst disguised as tattoo artists.

00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:07.585
You also mentioned forging just now.

00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:10.425
So, I ran it through my mind

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.465
to see what exactly

00:02:12.545 --> 00:02:17.705
you need forged in
Prince of Yuzhang's Manor.

00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:23.225
Well,
if you wish to forge His Highness's seal,

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:25.305
allow me to suggest

00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:27.465
Wuxi green jade.

00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:30.625
Miss Ling, Wuxi green jade

00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:32.625
is indeed the material with
which the royal seal is made.

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.025
I keep running into you.

00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:37.985
What are you after?

00:02:38.065 --> 00:02:40.265
I wish to follow you and achieve greatness

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:42.065
to make a name for myself

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:43.065
in this martial world.

00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:46.105
Fame and glory are but an illusion.
I do not share your goal.

00:02:46.185 --> 00:02:47.345
We all have different ambitions.

00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:48.625
But isn't it beautiful

00:02:48.705 --> 00:02:50.065
to share a journey together?

00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:05.505
Wuxi green jade
for your perusal, Your Majesty.

00:03:10.465 --> 00:03:11.745
Good.

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:20.305
Why are you shaking?

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:22.985
I'm not killing you.

00:03:23.785 --> 00:03:25.025
Thank you for clemency, Your Highness.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:26.865
Have you found

00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:28.905
the two fraudsters?

00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:31.145
Your Highness,

00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:34.385
they snuck out of the manor stealthily
and disappeared.

00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:36.385
But none of our property is lost.

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:38.985
And you couldn't discern
real tattoo artists from the fake ones?

00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:42.305
Tattoos have intricate patterns.

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:44.545
But those fraudsters did a good job
replicating the patterns.

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:46.505
So you're saying

00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:49.545
that they put in so much effort

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.025
into approaching me

00:03:52.105 --> 00:03:54.625
so that they could tattoo a bird on me

00:03:54.705 --> 00:03:56.265
to humiliate me?

00:03:57.225 --> 00:03:59.065
You're an idiot!

00:04:01.505 --> 00:04:02.785
You know what?

00:04:02.865 --> 00:04:05.225
Re-enact the whole
scene with the housekeeper.

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:08.305
Even if you can't figure out the truth,

00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:09.825
I will still spare you.

00:04:10.745 --> 00:04:11.945
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:13.265
But I'll break your legs

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:15.145
and feed you to the hounds.

00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:19.624
Make haste.

00:04:20.585 --> 00:04:21.585
Yes.

00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:29.665
FENGLAI PAVILION

00:04:31.785 --> 00:04:33.985
Forgive me. All jades are unique.

00:04:34.585 --> 00:04:37.625
This one might be slightly different
from the one used by Prince of Yuzhang.

00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:39.385
-It can't be helped.
-This jade

00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:41.025
is more polished than the real one.

00:04:41.105 --> 00:04:42.545
And you found it within one night?

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:43.705
You're amazing.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:47.225
Prince of Yuzhang's seal

00:04:47.305 --> 00:04:50.065
is engraved
with four claws that subdue evil.

00:04:50.145 --> 00:04:51.185
Just who exactly are you?

00:04:52.505 --> 00:04:54.545
I'm Bai Chifan

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:55.665
of the Xiling region.

00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:56.905
Bai Chifan?

00:04:57.825 --> 00:04:58.985
Bai Chifan.

00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:02.545
You have the name of a fraudster.

00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:03.825
You are mistaken.

00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:05.425
I come

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.265
from an affluent family,

00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:08.585
so I must be discreet.

00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:11.745
Are you related to the Bai clan of Xiling?

00:05:13.065 --> 00:05:14.265
A distant relative of theirs.

00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:15.385
A distant relative?

00:05:15.465 --> 00:05:17.905
The Bai clan of Xiling
is a sword-wielding clan.

00:05:18.505 --> 00:05:20.865
They were a big name
in the martial world for several decades.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:22.945
Then, they went to
the western regions to trade.

00:05:23.025 --> 00:05:25.265
It is true that they are rich right now.

00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:29.505
-So you truly are Bai Chifan?
-Yes.

00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:32.385
A spoiled heir who forsook
martial arts for mercantile skills?

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:35.025
Who's your father?
My origin doesn't define me.

00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:37.185
Just like I never asked
who your father is.

00:05:37.785 --> 00:05:38.905
Why must you know who my father is?

00:05:41.345 --> 00:05:42.985
So you're just a spoiled heir.

00:05:43.065 --> 00:05:44.705
Do you even know
what makes the martial world?

00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:48.105
Everyone has a different take.

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:49.505
Some fight for vengeance.

00:05:49.585 --> 00:05:50.625
Some fight for justice

00:05:50.705 --> 00:05:51.985
or bonds that cannot be severed.

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:53.465
They all make up the martial world.

00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:55.105
In my opinion,

00:05:55.185 --> 00:05:58.105
it is enough as long as I possess the will

00:05:58.185 --> 00:05:59.225
to wield my sword.

00:06:01.505 --> 00:06:02.905
Since you're so insightful,

00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:04.625
can you guess

00:06:04.705 --> 00:06:07.545
what I'm after?

00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:12.625
Expensive robes. Thumb ring.

00:06:13.305 --> 00:06:14.265
Royal seal.

00:06:14.785 --> 00:06:16.065
Are you gathering these items

00:06:16.745 --> 00:06:18.785
to impersonate Prince of Yuzhang?

00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:21.905
It's not that serious.
You'll just get your entire family killed.

00:06:23.145 --> 00:06:25.105
Oh. From what I was told,

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:27.985
Prince of Yuzhang might seem boisterous,

00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:29.425
but he's actually quite observant.

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:32.145
He might
have already seen through your trick.

00:06:40.585 --> 00:06:44.025
It seems like I did underestimate you.

00:06:44.545 --> 00:06:46.065
I hope you won't bar me

00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:47.785
from joining Fenglai Pavilion

00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:49.385
simply because I know too much.

00:06:49.465 --> 00:06:50.625
Of course, not.

00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:54.265
Fenglai Pavilion
never breaks its promises.

00:06:54.905 --> 00:06:56.425
My friend, take a seat.

00:06:57.145 --> 00:06:59.985
Don't worry.
We do not renege on our promises.

00:07:00.065 --> 00:07:01.865
Give me a few days.

00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:03.585
After I consult the rest,

00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:05.865
I'll give you a satisfactory answer.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:22.705
Miss Ling, you're committing a crime.

00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:25.305
It's against our sect's rules.

00:07:25.985 --> 00:07:27.745
He knows too much.

00:07:27.825 --> 00:07:30.105
I can't risk letting him ruin our plan.

00:07:30.185 --> 00:07:31.665
Luo, imprison him.

00:07:31.745 --> 00:07:33.665
-Yes.
-Zhong Lin.

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.945
Check if someone did
leave the Bai clan of Xiling

00:07:36.025 --> 00:07:38.345
to go on an adventure
in the martial world.

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:39.505
Yes.

00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:49.745
FENGLAI PAVILION

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:06.825
They know Cangcang
is after Frostflame Iron.

00:08:06.905 --> 00:08:08.225
Something's afoot.

00:08:08.305 --> 00:08:09.545
Report back to the capital immediately.

00:08:25.265 --> 00:08:26.785
We get in from this side

00:08:26.865 --> 00:08:28.265
and you will enter from here.

00:08:28.345 --> 00:08:29.185
REFINEMENT QUARRY

00:08:29.265 --> 00:08:30.305
We'll group up here.

00:08:31.025 --> 00:08:33.144
Once it's done, wait for my signal.

00:08:34.945 --> 00:08:37.465
-Cangcang.I need to tell you something.
-Oh, you're here.

00:08:37.545 --> 00:08:40.185
Luo. Look. The royal seal is done.

00:08:40.264 --> 00:08:42.385
Everything is in order.
It's up to you now.

00:08:44.465 --> 00:08:47.145
Cangcang. I have to be away for a while.

00:08:49.665 --> 00:08:50.905
Are you serious?

00:08:51.545 --> 00:08:53.265
-I'm serious.
-You are?

00:08:55.865 --> 00:08:56.705
But

00:08:56.785 --> 00:08:57.865
we planned this for so long.

00:08:57.945 --> 00:08:59.265
If you leave now,
everything will go to waste.

00:09:00.425 --> 00:09:03.305
Besides, how am I supposed
to find another Prince of Yuzhang?

00:09:03.905 --> 00:09:05.905
Why don't we delay it for a few days?

00:09:05.985 --> 00:09:06.945
No.

00:09:07.465 --> 00:09:09.345
If we miss the timing, we'll be in danger.

00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:13.265
It is an urgent matter
that I must attend to.

00:09:15.505 --> 00:09:16.585
Is it my father?

00:09:21.065 --> 00:09:22.425
The worst outcome will always happen.

00:09:24.225 --> 00:09:26.025
Why must he take
you away at this crucial moment?

00:09:26.705 --> 00:09:27.625
Just go.

00:09:28.225 --> 00:09:30.385
-What will you do now?
-What can I do? I'll figure it out.

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:40.625
He left for real.

00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:42.745
I…

00:09:43.745 --> 00:09:44.745
Cangcang.

00:09:44.825 --> 00:09:46.505
He left just like that.
Who can impersonate Prince of Yuzhang now?

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:47.825
How would I know?

00:09:58.425 --> 00:09:59.465
Perhaps…

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.185
Miss Ling.

00:10:07.265 --> 00:10:08.785
How have you been?

00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:14.465
What do you think, Cangcang?

00:10:17.225 --> 00:10:18.225
It's not good.

00:10:18.825 --> 00:10:19.825
What do you mean?

00:10:19.905 --> 00:10:21.745
I have the thumb ring and the fan.

00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:23.985
No, it's not good.

00:10:24.065 --> 00:10:25.905
You look like a feeble scholar,

00:10:25.985 --> 00:10:27.345
and not a prince.

00:10:27.905 --> 00:10:28.865
What do we do now then?

00:10:29.465 --> 00:10:31.705
Are we just going to give up?

00:10:35.745 --> 00:10:36.705
This is bad.

00:10:38.105 --> 00:10:39.185
What should we do?

00:10:44.305 --> 00:10:46.305
I have an idea.

00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:03.705
I was careless.

00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:33.545
Miss Ling, what is the meaning of this?

00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:35.145
Speak! Who exactly are you?

00:11:35.705 --> 00:11:37.585
-Bai Chifan.
-Stubborn, aren't you?

00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:39.825
Bring them in.

00:11:45.585 --> 00:11:48.345
Fenglai Pavilion
has a wide selection of torture tools.

00:12:01.745 --> 00:12:03.865
I'm giving you one last chance.

00:12:03.945 --> 00:12:05.145
Answer honestly.

00:12:05.865 --> 00:12:06.905
If you lie to me,

00:12:06.985 --> 00:12:09.105
you'll have a taste
of all my torture devices.

00:12:09.665 --> 00:12:10.665
Ask away.

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:15.865
Did my father send you here to spy on me?

00:12:15.945 --> 00:12:17.105
No one

00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:18.745
can order me around.

00:12:19.345 --> 00:12:21.865
You can be the first if you let me

00:12:21.945 --> 00:12:23.265
join Fenglai Pavilion.

00:12:24.865 --> 00:12:26.425
How arrogant.

00:12:26.985 --> 00:12:27.825
Who are you? The emperor?

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.225
If my father did not send you here,

00:12:30.305 --> 00:12:33.025
why do you know and care about

00:12:33.105 --> 00:12:34.865
my whereabouts and Fenglai Pavilion?

00:12:34.945 --> 00:12:35.785
Explain yourself.

00:12:35.865 --> 00:12:37.065
One who understands
the rules of the five elements

00:12:37.145 --> 00:12:39.225
and the nature of humanity

00:12:39.305 --> 00:12:40.785
will know all there is
to know in the universe.

00:12:52.025 --> 00:12:53.185
Enough of your nonsense.

00:12:53.985 --> 00:12:56.145
I am not making anything up.

00:12:56.225 --> 00:12:57.625
My father did not send you here?

00:12:57.705 --> 00:12:59.825
Shouldn't I be more trustworthy

00:13:00.345 --> 00:13:02.265
if I were close to your father?

00:13:11.025 --> 00:13:12.185
Release him.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:26.945
He has the looks

00:13:27.825 --> 00:13:30.105
and the comportment for it.

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:32.705
Since I have no better option,

00:13:32.785 --> 00:13:34.025
I'll just have to use him.

00:13:34.905 --> 00:13:35.945
Bai Chifan.

00:13:37.425 --> 00:13:38.305
I have a use for you.

00:13:43.145 --> 00:13:44.745
FENGLAI PAVILION

00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:46.625
Miss Ling, can you tell me

00:13:46.705 --> 00:13:48.745
why I must impersonate Prince of Yuzhang

00:13:48.825 --> 00:13:50.945
and risk getting my entire family killed?

00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:54.385
Don't worry.
Now that you're part of my sect,

00:13:55.505 --> 00:13:57.185
you're mine.

00:13:58.025 --> 00:13:59.665
Come what may,

00:13:59.745 --> 00:14:01.305
I'll protect you.

00:14:02.745 --> 00:14:05.745
And if I insist on finding out why?

00:14:07.905 --> 00:14:08.985
Right.

00:14:09.065 --> 00:14:11.065
Since you're taking the risk,

00:14:11.145 --> 00:14:13.265
you earn the right to know.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:17.905
Give me a moment.

00:14:26.385 --> 00:14:28.145
FROSTFLAME IRON

00:14:28.905 --> 00:14:30.825
Frostflame Iron?

00:14:30.905 --> 00:14:32.425
Yes. Did you know?

00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:33.905
One who owns Frostflame Iron

00:14:33.985 --> 00:14:36.345
can craft a divine
weapon to lead the martial world.

00:14:37.185 --> 00:14:38.105
Frostflame Iron

00:14:38.185 --> 00:14:41.225
must first endure
abyssal flame for a millennium

00:14:41.305 --> 00:14:43.705
before being frozen for another millennium

00:14:43.785 --> 00:14:46.625
in order to form this distinct pattern.

00:14:46.705 --> 00:14:47.865
Also,

00:14:47.945 --> 00:14:50.305
a sword made of this iron

00:14:50.385 --> 00:14:51.665
is indestructible.

00:14:52.705 --> 00:14:54.025
The Great Qi Dynasty has not seen

00:14:54.105 --> 00:14:55.745
such material in several centuries.

00:14:55.825 --> 00:14:57.185
Several days ago,

00:14:57.265 --> 00:14:59.625
they found one
in the quarry in Southern Chu.

00:14:59.705 --> 00:15:02.585
So you want me to
impersonate Prince of Yuzhang

00:15:02.665 --> 00:15:04.665
to get this iron ore?

00:15:04.745 --> 00:15:07.545
Yes. Prince of Yuzhang rules Southern Chu.

00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:08.745
If Prince of Yuzhang wants it,

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:09.985
they'll have to turn it in.

00:15:10.585 --> 00:15:11.665
You're so naive.

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:14.825
Do you really think a few weapons
with this iron will allow you

00:15:14.905 --> 00:15:15.825
to rule the martial world?

00:15:15.905 --> 00:15:16.745
What's wrong with that?

00:15:16.825 --> 00:15:18.185
In this martial world,

00:15:18.265 --> 00:15:19.625
the sharper the blade,
the more power you have.

00:15:19.705 --> 00:15:21.505
What else?

00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:27.385
BRUSH AND INK

00:15:27.465 --> 00:15:30.105
Father, I am telling the truth.

00:15:33.865 --> 00:15:35.425
In that case, explain why

00:15:35.505 --> 00:15:38.145
Cangcang put in so much effort

00:15:38.225 --> 00:15:41.145
for one Frostflame Iron.

00:15:41.225 --> 00:15:42.745
She was looking for the hall master

00:15:42.825 --> 00:15:44.625
and wanted someone to
impersonate Prince of Yuzhang.

00:15:45.145 --> 00:15:46.905
If she wanted the iron ore,

00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:48.425
she could've come to me.

00:15:49.265 --> 00:15:50.585
Perhaps Young Lady

00:15:50.665 --> 00:15:51.785
doesn't want to rely
on you for everything.

00:15:53.425 --> 00:15:54.425
It's not as simple as that.

00:15:55.385 --> 00:15:58.145
Cangcang has always
been an opinionated kid.

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:04.105
Xianxue.

00:16:05.025 --> 00:16:06.705
I know

00:16:06.785 --> 00:16:08.585
you are loyal, responsible,

00:16:09.305 --> 00:16:10.305
and meticulous.

00:16:11.745 --> 00:16:14.785
But you seem to forget to mention

00:16:15.385 --> 00:16:16.705
a certain Bai clan member of Xiling

00:16:17.785 --> 00:16:19.545
who approached Cangcang lately.

00:16:21.425 --> 00:16:22.345
He…

00:16:23.505 --> 00:16:24.545
He's Bai Chifan.

00:16:25.305 --> 00:16:26.465
He keeps pestering Young Lady.

00:16:27.065 --> 00:16:29.505
But she doesn't really take him seriously.

00:16:30.145 --> 00:16:31.985
She even thought
you had sent him to spy on her.

00:16:32.065 --> 00:16:34.345
Do you know why I summoned you

00:16:35.225 --> 00:16:36.825
back here?

00:16:36.905 --> 00:16:37.905
Please enlighten me.

00:16:47.705 --> 00:16:49.145
Xianxue.

00:16:50.105 --> 00:16:51.825
You must know

00:16:51.905 --> 00:16:53.585
that Cangcang

00:16:54.105 --> 00:16:56.265
is now in Southern Chu,

00:16:56.345 --> 00:16:58.465
the territory of Prince of Yuzhang.

00:17:02.225 --> 00:17:03.465
Xianxue.

00:17:05.745 --> 00:17:07.464
No matter what happens,

00:17:08.785 --> 00:17:11.065
you must protect her.

00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:13.145
In the meantime,

00:17:13.224 --> 00:17:14.825
I need to know

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.025
what she's doing.

00:17:17.944 --> 00:17:19.224
Yes, Father.

00:17:19.825 --> 00:17:22.145
Now return to Southern Chu.

00:17:22.665 --> 00:17:25.145
I need you to do something.

00:17:30.705 --> 00:17:32.745
-Yes, Sir.
-Go now.

00:17:35.785 --> 00:17:36.665
Xianxue.

00:17:38.385 --> 00:17:39.745
You must know that Cangcang

00:17:41.545 --> 00:17:43.145
will be the Empress consort.

00:17:47.665 --> 00:17:50.185
So cease whatever wishful thinking

00:17:51.105 --> 00:17:52.545
you have now.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:56.745
Yes.

00:18:02.585 --> 00:18:04.105
Let's go.

00:18:04.185 --> 00:18:06.145
People have gone missing lately.

00:18:06.225 --> 00:18:07.585
Let's hurry up.

00:18:08.465 --> 00:18:10.825
We've been foraging
for vegetables in the mountains.

00:18:10.905 --> 00:18:12.825
I'm so hungry that I can't walk.

00:18:16.305 --> 00:18:17.265
A bun!

00:18:18.465 --> 00:18:20.225
Don't eat it.
We don't know where it's from.

00:18:20.305 --> 00:18:21.385
What if it's poisoned?

00:18:21.465 --> 00:18:23.785
Why would anyone poison a bun?

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:35.745
Wake up!

00:18:37.105 --> 00:18:38.265
Get up!

00:18:39.545 --> 00:18:40.665
Get up!

00:18:47.425 --> 00:18:48.625
Eat the buns now

00:18:49.225 --> 00:18:50.705
or you won't even be able to afford it

00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:52.385
in the quarry.

00:19:32.145 --> 00:19:34.105
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:19:34.185 --> 00:19:35.545
Why are you

00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:37.105
sneaking up this late at night?

00:19:37.185 --> 00:19:38.705
It is my duty to make sure

00:19:38.785 --> 00:19:40.545
that you are always alert, Your Majesty.

00:19:41.865 --> 00:19:43.385
All right, Shi Yan. Take a seat.

00:19:54.305 --> 00:19:56.265
Shi Yan. Did you find anything

00:19:56.345 --> 00:19:57.985
about Refinement Quarry
that I told you to?

00:19:58.545 --> 00:20:00.185
Your Majesty, on the surface,

00:20:00.265 --> 00:20:02.345
that quarry mines and processes ores.

00:20:02.425 --> 00:20:03.905
But in reality, it runs a monopoly

00:20:03.985 --> 00:20:06.505
that abducts citizens to be miners
and forges weapons without authorization.

00:20:06.585 --> 00:20:07.745
Many people have died.

00:20:09.025 --> 00:20:10.945
Many young boys went
missing in Southern Chu.

00:20:11.025 --> 00:20:11.985
In fact, more than 100
young boys have disappeared.

00:20:12.585 --> 00:20:14.025
Southern Chu is an affluent region

00:20:14.105 --> 00:20:15.145
that is governed by Prince of Yuzhang.

00:20:15.225 --> 00:20:16.865
You must have misheard, Your Majesty.

00:20:18.265 --> 00:20:21.385
In that case,
they are behind the missing boys

00:20:21.465 --> 00:20:22.385
of Southern Chu.

00:20:22.905 --> 00:20:24.465
At this moment, it seems so.

00:20:24.545 --> 00:20:25.745
My investigation

00:20:25.825 --> 00:20:27.545
reveals that Lingbi Sect
is behind the quarry.

00:20:27.625 --> 00:20:28.985
And the one running the sect is…

00:20:29.065 --> 00:20:31.105
Grand Tutor Ling is quite ambitious.

00:20:31.185 --> 00:20:33.625
Southern Chu is
Prince of Yuzhang's territory,

00:20:33.705 --> 00:20:35.945
and he is committing his crime here.

00:20:36.025 --> 00:20:38.985
Isn't Ling Cangcang
sabotaging her father's plan

00:20:39.065 --> 00:20:40.585
by going to the quarry?

00:20:41.905 --> 00:20:43.825
Perhaps she isn't even aware

00:20:43.905 --> 00:20:45.745
of the ties between
her father and Lingbi Sect.

00:20:48.785 --> 00:20:50.585
Luo Xianxue
returned to the capital suddenly.

00:20:51.145 --> 00:20:52.745
He might already know that I'm here.

00:20:52.825 --> 00:20:54.665
This time, not only must
we bring back the Empress,

00:20:54.745 --> 00:20:56.505
we must also get rid of Lingbi Sect,

00:20:57.505 --> 00:20:58.905
thereby extinguishing
his contingency plan.

00:20:58.985 --> 00:21:01.585
The marriage is inevitable.

00:21:01.665 --> 00:21:04.625
We must now help Ling Cangcang
achieve her goal as soon as possible.

00:21:10.545 --> 00:21:12.785
Impersonating me in public?

00:21:12.865 --> 00:21:13.985
The audacity of it!

00:21:14.665 --> 00:21:16.505
Slow down. They can't have run far.

00:21:16.585 --> 00:21:18.385
Are you sure
they headed to Refinement Quarry?

00:21:18.465 --> 00:21:20.425
Yes. Absolutely.

00:21:21.305 --> 00:21:22.425
All right.

00:21:23.025 --> 00:21:25.985
If you make another wrong judgment,
you'll pay for it.

00:21:36.985 --> 00:21:38.825
Hurry up! Faster!

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:42.185
I'm talking about you! Hurry!

00:21:42.265 --> 00:21:44.505
There are only kids in this cave.

00:21:44.585 --> 00:21:45.865
No need to feed them properly.

00:21:45.945 --> 00:21:47.465
Just one bun per day.

00:21:48.065 --> 00:21:49.025
If that's not enough,

00:21:49.105 --> 00:21:50.065
tell them to drink water.

00:21:50.665 --> 00:21:53.825
Sir, the laborers we have
are too swollen to walk now.

00:21:53.905 --> 00:21:55.625
Ten kids died last month.

00:21:55.705 --> 00:21:58.065
All our men are out there capturing kids.

00:21:58.145 --> 00:22:00.105
But we still don't have enough manpower.

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:02.585
There is even a rumor saying

00:22:02.665 --> 00:22:04.345
that the ghosts are kidnapping kids.

00:22:04.425 --> 00:22:05.265
Besides,

00:22:05.345 --> 00:22:07.065
if something bad happens,

00:22:07.145 --> 00:22:08.225
what do we do?

00:22:08.305 --> 00:22:10.105
We are working
for the Ghost King after all!

00:22:10.185 --> 00:22:11.305
Right.

00:22:12.185 --> 00:22:13.545
He wants the money urgently.

00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:15.185
What can we do?

00:22:15.785 --> 00:22:18.705
And you. You talk a lot

00:22:18.785 --> 00:22:19.825
and eat a lot.

00:22:22.305 --> 00:22:23.225
What now?

00:22:23.305 --> 00:22:24.465
Why are you in a rush?

00:22:24.545 --> 00:22:25.905
Prince of Yuzhang is here.

00:22:26.785 --> 00:22:27.705
Prince of Yuzhang?

00:22:29.465 --> 00:22:30.505
What is he doing here?

00:23:07.305 --> 00:23:08.945
Greetings, Your…

00:23:27.465 --> 00:23:28.785
Are you the owner of this quarry?

00:23:30.385 --> 00:23:31.545
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:23:31.625 --> 00:23:34.185
What can I do for you?

00:23:36.185 --> 00:23:37.425
I was told

00:23:37.505 --> 00:23:38.985
that you found Frostflame Iron.

00:23:42.665 --> 00:23:44.425
Your Highness, you need not come here

00:23:44.505 --> 00:23:45.665
in person for one iron ore.

00:23:46.585 --> 00:23:47.785
If you desire it,

00:23:47.865 --> 00:23:48.705
just say so

00:23:48.785 --> 00:23:50.905
and I will have
it delivered to your manor.

00:23:58.425 --> 00:23:59.345
What?

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:01.625
Are you doubting my identity?

00:24:03.905 --> 00:24:04.825
Of course, not.

00:24:11.385 --> 00:24:12.505
Look closely.

00:24:15.785 --> 00:24:18.185
Wuxi green jade.
Even a fortune can't buy it.

00:24:18.785 --> 00:24:19.625
It is in the right form too.

00:24:24.825 --> 00:24:25.825
Frostflame Iron, is it?

00:24:26.425 --> 00:24:27.425
Let me retrieve it now.

00:24:29.185 --> 00:24:30.345
You, come with me.

00:24:30.425 --> 00:24:32.865
-You two, serve His Highness tea.
-Yes.

00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:11.265
What a delicate chest.

00:25:11.345 --> 00:25:13.585
It must have been
made by a famous blacksmith.

00:25:15.345 --> 00:25:16.625
You know many things, Your Highness.

00:25:16.705 --> 00:25:19.425
Precious iron ores must
be stored in a precious box.

00:25:19.505 --> 00:25:20.705
Please, Your Highness.

00:26:00.985 --> 00:26:02.945
How dare you
try to murder Prince of Yuzhang!

00:26:03.025 --> 00:26:04.265
Prince of Yuzhang?

00:26:05.305 --> 00:26:06.305
The prince's royal seal

00:26:06.385 --> 00:26:07.745
has four claws to subdue evil.

00:26:07.825 --> 00:26:09.345
But yours has five claws.

00:26:12.185 --> 00:26:14.225
Prince of Yuzhang's seal is engraved

00:26:14.305 --> 00:26:15.545
with four claws to subdue evil.

00:26:17.265 --> 00:26:19.225
If I don't even
possess such basic knowledge,

00:26:19.305 --> 00:26:21.545
how can I even run my smithing business?

00:26:21.625 --> 00:26:22.745
Insolence!

00:26:36.825 --> 00:26:37.985
Hold your breath.

00:28:07.505 --> 00:28:08.665
Give chase now! Quick!

00:28:10.225 --> 00:28:11.305
Hurry!

00:28:14.425 --> 00:28:15.665
Over there!

00:28:22.265 --> 00:28:23.265
You can escape no more.

00:28:23.345 --> 00:28:25.425
Don't you know where you are?

00:28:25.505 --> 00:28:27.985
You think you
can steal the Frostflame Iron?

00:28:29.105 --> 00:28:30.145
Who says

00:28:31.745 --> 00:28:33.785
we're after the Frostflame Iron?

00:28:45.665 --> 00:28:47.945
Mister, you are…

00:28:48.945 --> 00:28:51.105
I am Shi Yan. Mr. Bai Chifan asked me

00:28:51.185 --> 00:28:52.465
to assist Fenglai Pavilion.

00:28:53.105 --> 00:28:54.145
Bai Chifan…

00:29:04.225 --> 00:29:05.305
What is going on?

00:29:05.385 --> 00:29:07.145
I think Quarry No. 2 blew up.

00:29:11.505 --> 00:29:12.865
Sir, this is bad!

00:29:12.945 --> 00:29:15.105
Sir! The slaves…

00:29:15.185 --> 00:29:17.185
-The slaves escaped.
-What?

00:29:18.785 --> 00:29:22.105
But sir, you said someone
was impersonating Prince of Yuzhang.

00:29:22.185 --> 00:29:24.065
So I dispatched all our men here.

00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:29.745
You fled on purpose

00:29:29.825 --> 00:29:30.745
to lure us here?

00:29:32.345 --> 00:29:34.745
It seems like
I've underestimated you both.

00:29:35.345 --> 00:29:36.345
I'm glad you know that.

00:29:37.145 --> 00:29:38.185
Bai Chifan.

00:29:38.265 --> 00:29:39.745
Zhong Lin already rescued those kids.

00:29:39.825 --> 00:29:40.985
Find an opening and flee.

00:29:41.585 --> 00:29:43.105
I'll watch your back.

00:29:45.665 --> 00:29:47.985
No, allow me to protect you.

00:29:53.785 --> 00:29:57.105
What a tear-jerking pair
of star-crossed lovers.

00:29:57.185 --> 00:29:59.585
Unfortunately for you,
my smoke is laced with potent poison.

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:01.345
It won't be long till you fall.

00:30:05.705 --> 00:30:06.545
Surrender

00:30:07.425 --> 00:30:09.825
yourself now and come clean.

00:30:10.425 --> 00:30:12.545
Then perhaps I'll spare you.

00:30:18.825 --> 00:30:19.825
Kill them all!

00:30:50.065 --> 00:30:52.105
Leave none alive. Kill them all!

00:31:03.785 --> 00:31:05.305
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

00:31:06.585 --> 00:31:07.625
Charge!

00:31:48.905 --> 00:31:49.945
Run now.

00:31:50.905 --> 00:31:51.865
Come!

00:32:11.265 --> 00:32:13.265
Don't worry about me. Just go.

00:32:35.305 --> 00:32:36.265
Come.

00:32:37.505 --> 00:32:38.705
Take this.

00:32:55.625 --> 00:32:56.785
What is it?

00:32:57.865 --> 00:32:58.745
A pill to save you.

00:33:36.545 --> 00:33:38.185
You don't want to
leave any witnesses alive.

00:35:35.905 --> 00:35:36.865
Ghost King of the Lingbi Sect?

00:36:13.625 --> 00:36:14.905
What a monster reared by Lingbi Sect.

00:36:16.225 --> 00:36:17.305
He is invincible.

00:36:37.825 --> 00:36:39.625
Prince of Yuzhang? He's finally here.

00:36:40.225 --> 00:36:41.105
Quite late too.

00:36:52.265 --> 00:36:54.985
Your Highness, please capture
these unscrupulous scoundrels.

00:36:55.585 --> 00:36:57.425
It's you, my dear brother.

00:36:57.945 --> 00:37:00.905
You're the unscrupulous scoundrels.

00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:02.025
Subdue them!

00:37:02.105 --> 00:37:03.705
-Yes, Your Highness.
-It's not us.

00:37:04.705 --> 00:37:06.665
You're mistaken.
We did this because we wanted to rescue…

00:37:11.025 --> 00:37:11.905
Let go of me.

00:37:15.065 --> 00:37:16.025
Let go!

00:37:22.625 --> 00:37:24.105
This is just a misunderstanding.

00:37:24.185 --> 00:37:26.345
We did this because
we wanted to rescue the slaves.

00:37:26.425 --> 00:37:28.825
Let me talk to His Highness! Don't go!

00:37:33.145 --> 00:37:33.985
I'm sorry.

00:37:35.705 --> 00:37:37.305
I promised to protect you.

00:37:37.985 --> 00:37:39.145
I failed that.

00:37:39.225 --> 00:37:41.425
But who knew Prince of
Yuzhang would arrive this late?

00:37:41.985 --> 00:37:43.585
So you wanted to
impersonate Prince of Yuzhang

00:37:43.665 --> 00:37:44.785
to lure the culprits away

00:37:44.865 --> 00:37:47.105
before you could bring them to justice?

00:37:47.945 --> 00:37:50.345
The miners were abducted off the street.

00:37:50.425 --> 00:37:52.825
Many of them are just teenagers.

00:37:53.545 --> 00:37:55.665
Fenglai Pavilion
doesn't covet fame and glory.

00:37:55.745 --> 00:37:57.305
We just want to help the helpless ones.

00:37:58.145 --> 00:38:01.185
So that's why
she refuses to enter the palace.

00:38:06.025 --> 00:38:08.745
If the plan fails, you might die.

00:38:08.825 --> 00:38:10.065
Have you thought about that?

00:38:10.905 --> 00:38:13.065
My life is precious, but so are theirs.

00:38:17.065 --> 00:38:18.945
I used you as bait today.

00:38:19.465 --> 00:38:20.385
I'm sorry.

00:38:20.465 --> 00:38:22.425
But it wasn't my
intention to get you hurt.

00:38:24.225 --> 00:38:25.345
Show me your wound.

00:38:27.025 --> 00:38:28.345
It's nothing.

00:38:28.425 --> 00:38:29.665
But you…

00:38:34.985 --> 00:38:36.945
In this vast world,
it's hard to find someone

00:38:37.025 --> 00:38:37.985
who will defend those victims.

00:38:39.025 --> 00:38:40.425
If this is your goal,

00:38:40.945 --> 00:38:42.105
I'll do everything I can

00:38:42.185 --> 00:38:43.345
to make sure you're not alone in this.

00:38:50.385 --> 00:38:53.905
Speaking of which,
he has saved me several times.

00:38:56.665 --> 00:38:58.265
No, allow me to protect you.

00:39:11.945 --> 00:39:14.745
Your pulse is stable but weak.

00:39:21.225 --> 00:39:22.545
It's all thanks to your pill.

00:39:23.105 --> 00:39:24.025
It sped up the recovery.

00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:28.705
How come you are immune

00:39:28.785 --> 00:39:30.145
to the poisonous smoke?

00:39:30.745 --> 00:39:32.865
Besides, you were shot by an arrow too.

00:39:34.745 --> 00:39:37.065
I am immune to all poisons.

00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:41.825
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

00:39:43.905 --> 00:39:45.065
I'm serious.

00:39:45.905 --> 00:39:47.225
I'll tell you more in the future.

00:40:02.385 --> 00:40:03.585
Your Highness.

00:40:03.665 --> 00:40:04.585
A missive from the Empress Dowager.

00:40:11.185 --> 00:40:13.305
Your Highness! What if Her Highness wishes

00:40:13.385 --> 00:40:14.705
to tell you something important?

00:40:15.305 --> 00:40:16.865
Every time Mother wrote to me,

00:40:16.945 --> 00:40:18.785
it was about His Majesty.

00:40:18.865 --> 00:40:20.145
I know what I'm doing.

00:40:23.665 --> 00:40:25.905
I'm leaving now.
Are you not going to see me off?

00:40:25.985 --> 00:40:27.385
From now on,

00:40:27.465 --> 00:40:29.105
you're a prince who governs a region.

00:40:29.185 --> 00:40:31.305
You'll have to think before you act now.

00:40:31.385 --> 00:40:33.625
Huan, before I leave, can you please

00:40:33.705 --> 00:40:35.745
give me the Great Qi Divination Chart

00:40:36.345 --> 00:40:37.425
drawn by Father?

00:40:37.505 --> 00:40:38.985
Father left it behind,

00:40:39.065 --> 00:40:39.945
and I wish to keep it

00:40:40.545 --> 00:40:41.385
as memorabilia.

00:40:43.185 --> 00:40:45.105
Father's chart

00:40:45.185 --> 00:40:47.145
contains the topography

00:40:47.225 --> 00:40:48.865
of Great Qi.

00:40:48.945 --> 00:40:50.265
You're asking for this chart.

00:40:50.345 --> 00:40:51.745
Does this mean you are still

00:40:52.385 --> 00:40:53.745
coveting the throne?

00:40:56.025 --> 00:40:57.025
Remember now.

00:40:58.065 --> 00:40:59.465
As long as I breathe,

00:41:00.385 --> 00:41:01.705
you will not

00:41:01.785 --> 00:41:03.185
have the divination chart.

00:41:30.705 --> 00:41:32.705
Prince of Yuzhang? You're finally here.

00:41:32.785 --> 00:41:34.225
I did impersonate and deceive you.

00:41:34.305 --> 00:41:35.625
But it was to save the kids.

00:41:35.705 --> 00:41:37.625
My achievement can offset the crime.

00:41:38.225 --> 00:41:39.545
No, it cannot.

00:41:39.625 --> 00:41:41.185
Can you be a generous soul
and let it slide?

00:41:41.785 --> 00:41:44.145
I hate the word,

00:41:44.225 --> 00:41:46.825
generous, the most.

00:41:46.905 --> 00:41:49.785
When I see that bird on my back,

00:41:54.785 --> 00:41:57.905
it only fuels my hatred more.

00:41:58.425 --> 00:41:59.665
Unless…

00:42:01.225 --> 00:42:02.065
Unless what?

00:42:02.145 --> 00:42:03.825
Unless the man behind you

00:42:03.905 --> 00:42:06.105
can apologize to me properly,

00:42:07.185 --> 00:42:09.185
then I may consider forgiving your crime.

00:42:09.825 --> 00:42:10.865
Look.

00:42:10.945 --> 00:42:12.545
I coerced him into coming here.

00:42:12.625 --> 00:42:13.625
It has nothing to do with him.

00:42:13.705 --> 00:42:14.905
I'll apologize to you on his behalf.

00:42:19.625 --> 00:42:20.905
I am Bai Chifan.

00:42:20.985 --> 00:42:21.945
It was not my intention to offend you.

00:42:22.025 --> 00:42:23.665
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

00:42:32.145 --> 00:42:33.145
Mr. Bai,

00:42:33.225 --> 00:42:35.545
you can put your dignity aside
when need be.

00:42:37.225 --> 00:42:39.545
Are you Bai Chifan for real?

00:42:43.065 --> 00:42:44.225
Yes.

00:42:44.825 --> 00:42:46.505
If that's the case,

00:42:46.585 --> 00:42:48.225
do you know the consequences

00:42:48.305 --> 00:42:49.705
of impersonating me?

00:42:50.425 --> 00:42:51.945
Wait, Your Highness.

00:42:52.025 --> 00:42:52.985
You are the ruler of Southern Chu

00:42:53.065 --> 00:42:55.585
yet you did not know
that there was an illegal quarry

00:42:55.665 --> 00:42:57.145
that refined iron in your feudal land.

00:42:57.945 --> 00:42:59.505
If His Majesty learns of it,

00:43:00.305 --> 00:43:01.745
you will be beheaded.

00:43:05.265 --> 00:43:07.825
We found the culprit for you.

00:43:07.905 --> 00:43:10.105
Your Highness
will not be seen as colluding with them.

00:43:10.185 --> 00:43:11.305
And with this achievement,

00:43:11.385 --> 00:43:13.065
His Majesty will surely praise you.

00:43:14.025 --> 00:43:16.385
By right, you should reward us.

00:43:16.465 --> 00:43:19.265
I'm here to punish you.

00:43:19.345 --> 00:43:21.065
Why must I reward you?

00:43:21.145 --> 00:43:22.465
Didn't I explain?

00:43:22.545 --> 00:43:25.905
Our achievement offsets the crime.
It's even now.

00:43:26.545 --> 00:43:27.465
All right now.

00:43:28.065 --> 00:43:29.185
We'll be leaving now.

00:43:29.825 --> 00:43:30.665
No need to see us off.

00:43:32.705 --> 00:43:33.745
Halt.

00:43:36.825 --> 00:43:38.145
To reward you two,

00:43:38.225 --> 00:43:39.345
I have set up a banquet.

00:43:39.425 --> 00:43:40.865
Won't you do me the honor?

00:43:47.585 --> 00:43:49.905
You did what
you did to save innocent lives.

00:43:49.985 --> 00:43:51.505
On behalf of Southern Chu citizens,

00:43:51.585 --> 00:43:52.425
allow me to thank you.

00:43:56.985 --> 00:43:58.145
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:44:03.065 --> 00:44:04.025
I'll dig in then.

00:44:10.345 --> 00:44:11.945
Miss Ling, you are still injured.

00:44:12.025 --> 00:44:13.825
You shouldn't ingest chilled food.

00:44:18.305 --> 00:44:20.905
Pear soup is rejuvenating.
You should drink more.

00:44:24.865 --> 00:44:26.425
-Here.
-Thank you.

00:44:29.425 --> 00:44:31.465
Mr. Bai, you seem to care a lot

00:44:31.545 --> 00:44:32.705
about this woman.

00:44:36.625 --> 00:44:38.145
Forgive me.

00:44:38.225 --> 00:44:39.825
How may I address you, miss?

00:44:42.065 --> 00:44:43.105
I'm…

00:44:43.185 --> 00:44:45.265
Oh. He's a prince.

00:44:45.345 --> 00:44:46.785
Surely, he knows
about the marital arrangement.

00:44:46.865 --> 00:44:48.425
I should not cause any unwanted trouble.

00:44:48.505 --> 00:44:50.065
I'm Zhong Lin, Vice Sect Leader
of Fenglai Pavilion.

00:44:52.625 --> 00:44:54.785
Oh, Miss Zhong.

00:44:56.065 --> 00:44:57.745
She must be Ling Cangcang.

00:44:58.345 --> 00:45:00.185
Huan always moves with a goal in mind.

00:45:00.265 --> 00:45:02.425
So he is after her.
