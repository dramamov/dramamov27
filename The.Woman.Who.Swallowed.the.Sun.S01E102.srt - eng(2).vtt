00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.850
(DNA Comparison Test Results)

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.210
(Match Status: Match)

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.280
(Client 1, Min Se Ri,
and Client 2, Stella Jang,)

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.350
(are biologically related
as grandparent and grandchild.)

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.080
It says Se Ri is my granddaughter.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.750
She's the daughter of my late son, Ho Se.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.520
Is that reason enough for you?

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.060
As her biological grandmother,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.200
I can't side with those trying to ruin her
and destroy her family business, can I?

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.070
Se Ri...

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.470
is your granddaughter?

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.880
Now that you know, leave.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.350
It's uncomfortable for me
to even be in the same room as you.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.920
I know how you feel about my Se Ri.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.620
You said it yourself last time.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.190
That you'd pay her back in kind.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.260
That for everything Mi So went through,
my Se Ri...

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.530
had to suffer just as much
before you'd be satisfied, right?

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.830
Talking to someone like that
in the same room...

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.500
is frankly too much for me.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.070
- Madam Jang.
- Se Ri...

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.340
is the only part of my son
left in this world.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.540
She's all I have left of him.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.810
She's the apple of my eye.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.550
You said Mi So was more important to you
than your own life, didn't you?

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.320
That's what Se Ri is to me.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.060
But this is still wrong.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.190
You know what Se Ri did to my Mi So!

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.400
The horrible things she did to her!

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.100
It was a mistake in her rebellious phase.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.900
Can't you understand
she was just in her rebellious phase?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.580
And let's be blunt,
wasn't your daughter the real problem?

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.780
She should have known when to stop
making such a scene.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.180
What kind of kid acts so recklessly
with no fear of the consequences?

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.150
Who would just stand by
and let that happen?

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.860
Se Ri actually went easy on her.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.200
Although Se Ri didn't say a word,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.460
she must still have been deeply shocked.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.830
What is wrong with your daughter?

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.740
It's because she was pathetically weak.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.700
No matter how hard the things
she went through were,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.070
she should have been stronger
to get over them. Suicide? Seriously?

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.080
And to do it at someone else's company,
of all places.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.480
If anything, we're the ones
who should have sued for damages.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.010
You should be grateful
that we let it go at that.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.120
So drop all of this now.
This whole revenge scheme.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.090
Madam Jang!

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.590
Get out.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.090
Get out while I'm asking nicely.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.660
If you don't, I'll have you thrown out.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.730
Out of respect for our past,

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.570
consider yourself lucky
I'm letting this go.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.640
No.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.970
I can't back down from this.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.810
You can't?
What are you going to do about it?

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.610
How can you be so selfish?

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.340
Do you think I'll reveal...

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.650
only that you're Baek Sul Hee?

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.250
No.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.180
I'll reveal that Moon Tae Kyung, in fact,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.760
joined Mingang to avenge his parents,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.060
that he's still just biding his time,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.190
and that he has a part of
Chairman Min Doo Sik's slush fund ledger.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.570
Do you really think
I'll keep my mouth shut about all that?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.440
So...

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.510
if you don't want Moon Tae Kyung hurt,
you'll leave quietly.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.880
Am I clear?

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.450
Tae Joo!

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.490
Drag her out.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.320
It's time for you to go.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.930
Let me go! Madam Jang!

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.930
I said, let go! Madam Jang!

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.670
Let go!

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.310
Wait, Tae Joo, you can't do this to me!

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.420
Tae Joo, wait!

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.220
What do you think you're doing?

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.820
It's not like we're strangers.
How can you treat her like this?

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.830
I have no choice.
Mother's orders were very clear.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.830
So you'll do anything
your mother tells you to?

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.900
Even if it's something unforgivable?

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.710
Take her with you.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.420
Lucia.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.820
Please, try to understand my mother.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.660
You know how much Ho Se meant to her.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.990
And they're saying
the child is his flesh and blood.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.970
What happened in there?

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.770
Did Madam Jang hit you?

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.980
Then what is it?

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.510
I was worried about you coming here alone,
so I followed you.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.310
What on earth happened?

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.250
Se Ri...

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.260
Se Ri is...

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.360
What about Se Ri?

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.630
She's Madam Jang's granddaughter.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.600
What did you just say?

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.610
I just can't believe it.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.540
They've already done a DNA test.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.010
So that's why she reinstated
Min Kyung Chae as CEO?

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.650
That's just the beginning.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.350
Now she'll kick us out of Mingang,

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.560
put Min Kyung Chae back
in the chairmanship,

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.530
and make her the new owner of Mingang.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.530
That's the only way...

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.700
Se Ri can inherit her position.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.570
We're in real trouble.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.870
Now that Madam Jang is on their side,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.800
there's no way we can win against her.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.210
I'm so upset.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.750
To think that's all
our relationship meant to her.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.020
I know.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.360
I know blood is thicker than water,
but how could she change just like that?

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.970
Don't say another word.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.240
For now, this is for the best.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.330
Why did Madam Jang suddenly side
with Min Kyung Chae?

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.230
What's going to happen to Lucia?

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.970
If the tables turn on me overnight,
what am I supposed to do?

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.270
Should I try to get on
Min Kyung Chae's good side?

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.910
Ask her to forget my past mistakes
and give me another chance?

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.320
This is so annoying!

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.890
Director Min is very calculating,

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.520
so she knows she just shot herself
in the foot.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.290
She's probably racking her brain,
trying to get back on your good side.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.630
What should I do?

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.460
Should I take her back or not?

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.230
You need to cut her loose.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.870
Keep only the people you need
and get rid of everyone else.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.510
Otherwise, they'll just betray you
again someday.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.880
So, keep only those I absolutely need
and get rid of the rest?

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.440
You have to.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.780
And then we can start fresh,
just the two of us.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.180
Mingang Distribution's second renaissance
led by Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.720
But for that to happen, my role as head
of the Legal Team is a bit limiting.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.890
I'd have to get more actively involved
in the management side of things...

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.560
to be able to properly support you.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.230
He's asking for a promotion.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.070
I want to be your right-hand man,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.310
but my position limits what I can do.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.240
And when it comes to management,

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.940
you know better than anyone...

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.040
that it's vital to have a partner
you can sync with.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:28.850
I know that very well,

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.550
but I can't just put you in some executive
or director position.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.690
Not when you're going to be my husband.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.960
That's true.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:41.660
All right. I'll think about it.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.030
Hello? What's up?

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.070
Right now?

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.910
What's so important that
you had to drag me out here?

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.010
Is Kyung Chae really taking over as CEO
just like that?

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.810
Otherwise, why would Lucia
just sit back and do nothing?

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.180
That's what's even weirder.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.420
The chairman kicked her out,

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.790
and the acting chairman brought her back?
Does that make any sense?

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.990
That's because Chairman Min was reckless.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.060
His feelings aside,
he shouldn't have fired the CEO like that.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.630
But the Board of Directors
approved it back then.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.930
Lucia bribed the directors
for their votes.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.830
Is that what happened behind the scenes?

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.470
Ji Seop.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.770
As your old college buddy,
no, as your friend,

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.780
or better yet,
as your future brother-in-law,

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.880
let me give you a tip.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.850
You need to pick the right side now.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.520
This is Stella Jang we're talking about.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.880
She's on a completely different level.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.090
Her power, her connections, her money.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.360
Whatever you're thinking,
she's beyond that.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.630
And someone like her
has turned her back on Lucia...

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.860
and picked Min Kyung Chae!

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.600
Don't you get it?

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.410
Hey.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.710
Are you all right?

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.980
Come on.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.670
Well done, Lucia.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.100
I owe it to you.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.740
To Mingang Distribution's
chairman's future wife.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.060
Just let it go.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.930
She's on a different path
from us now anyway.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.300
We need to forget all of it and figure out
how we're going to survive.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.200
So we should just focus on surviving?

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:41.970
Of course we do.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.340
She went as far as to betray us
to save her own skin.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.440
We can't just sit here and take it.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.680
If Madam Jang decides to reveal
our identities tomorrow,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.280
- then we're instantly...
- No.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.420
That won't be so easy for her.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.590
If she does that,

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.720
it'll reveal she was the mastermind
of this revenge scheme...

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.230
and that she was the one
who orchestrated your new identity.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.760
Even for the great Madam Jang,
exposing her dirty laundry like that...

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.230
won't be an easy thing to do.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.340
I don't know what to think...

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.570
of Madam Jang anymore.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.820
How long are you going to keep me
from seeing my father?

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.290
My father isn't dead, is he?

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.660
What did you just say?

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.000
If you're keeping it a secret...

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.800
from his own children
whether he's alive or dead,

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.770
then something terrible
must have happened.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.840
Why are you being so disrespectful,
Kyung Chae?

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.910
She must have a good reason
for not allowing visitors.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.280
Why are you questioning it?
Just do as you're told.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.050
Since when were you so obedient?

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.020
I always have been. What's it to you?

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.120
Right now, she's the acting chairman
in place of your father,

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.390
and she's swamped.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.030
Plus, she has to appoint a new CEO soon.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.430
Can you imagine how much
she has on her plate?

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.500
So just stay out of it, Kyung Chae.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.630
Why does someone with no job
have so much to say?

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.710
Mother, just ignore whatever she says.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.640
Please think carefully...

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.050
and appoint the right person
for the CEO position.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.250
Right.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.950
You know how much my husband
worries about you,

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.790
don't you?

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.260
What's wrong with you?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.330
You senseless woman!

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.590
You can't act that way to Kyung Chae now!

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.930
The tide has turned in Kyung Chae's favor!

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.460
What are you talking about?

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.270
She's jobless.
How could the tide have turned?

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.970
Things have changed!

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.000
Kyung Chae's been nominated for CEO,
and she's got some serious backing now!

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.040
We have to get on Kyung Chae's good side.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.240
Wait, what?
Kyung Chae is back in the CEO position?

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.740
When did that happen?

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.810
If something that big happened,
you should have told me right away!

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.880
I was so dumbfounded
that I was speechless.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.390
I still can't wrap my head around
how everything did a 180 overnight.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.760
So you'd better start groveling
to Kyung Chae, you got it?

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.160
When did everything
get turned upside down?

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.630
Madam Jang,
who was Stepmother's top supporter,

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.160
switched over to Kyung Chae's side.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.370
I'm telling you, she looks at Stepmother
like she's her mortal enemy now.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.740
The doors are closing.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.410
Hold on. Please wait for me.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.050
(Mingang Distribution)

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.930
Are you here to see CEO Min?

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.190
She's the birth mother
of my granddaughter.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.330
Of course, I should see her often.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:52.860
And I miss her.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.530
I guess blood really is
thicker than water.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.040
Madam Jang.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.570
Let's drop the formalities.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.910
There's no reason to call each other
that anymore, is there?

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.450
To you, was I...

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.980
really nothing at all?

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.650
What answer are you hoping for?

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.960
Think about all the time
we spent together.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.620
I was just wondering if it really...

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.790
meant nothing to you.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.730
Because to me, you were...

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.630
like my mother.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.100
Funny you should mention that.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.540
I'm holding back for old times' sake.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.670
"How can we ruin Se Ri?"

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.580
"How can we dismantle
Se Ri's family business?"

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.110
"How can we destroy Se Ri's family?"

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.720
When I remember all the time we spent
putting our heads together, scheming,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.490
it makes my blood boil.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:52.660
Right.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.630
And speaking of which,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.860
whatever you try to do, Lucia,

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.500
I'm going to stop you at every turn.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.040
And in the end, out of your clutches,
I will save both Se Ri and Mingang.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.870
When I set my mind to something,
I get it done.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.040
You know that very well, don't you?

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.040
Just what kind of person I am.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.520
(Mingang Distribution)

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.840
If you're going to do this,
you have to go all in.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.240
What are you talking about, Mother?

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:42.840
War.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.240
War?

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.980
You have to oust Lucia and Tae Kyung.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.580
Are you just going to let them stay
at Mingang Distribution?

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.980
I agree with you,
but I don't have a cause right now.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.490
Then take down Min Soo Jung first.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.150
She thinks being family is enough...

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.690
and has gotten way too arrogant.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.220
Soo Jung?

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.030
So you were just going to leave her be?

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:04.500
No, it's not that,

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.170
- but it's just so sudden.
- From now on, you do exactly as I say.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.270
I'll come up with the strategy.
All you have to do is follow my orders.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.740
I will, Mother.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.610
We take Director Min's position
and use it as a bargaining chip.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.580
Offer the position to Min Ji Seop...

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.110
to get him to join our side.
That's how you reel him in.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.480
Give the director position to my brother?

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.750
How else are we going to get his shares?

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.590
He controls his wife's shares,
so he represents two votes.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.460
Take down Min Soo Jung,

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.330
offer him her position,
and then take his shares.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.000
Take everything you can get your hands on.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.670
Then, whether Chairman Min
wakes up or not,

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.370
no matter what happens,

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.810
Min Kyung Chae will be
the unshakable majority shareholder.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.910
How are you so brilliant?

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.010
You're a natural-born strategist.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.680
I have so much respect for you.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.310
Mother, I love you.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:00.120
Enjoy your meal.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.320
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.620
- Thank you.
- Here's your beef pancake.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.260
Enjoy.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.460
We're slammed today.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.170
It's good in any season,
and everyone loves a nourishing meal.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:20.540
It's great that business is booming,
but somehow, I'm feeling the autumn blues.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.340
If it's good, it's good.
What's with all the drama?

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.810
Mal Sook, if I suddenly hit the jackpot,
how would you feel?

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.710
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.380
Forget about hitting the jackpot,
and just try not to get hit by lightning.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.550
We're expecting thunder and lightning,
according to the forecast.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.860
On an autumn day perfect for poetry,
that's the kind of thing you say?

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.160
Do you want me to get struck by lightning
and drop dead?

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.300
No! I'm telling you not to.
I'm just telling you to be careful.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.830
Why are you so on edge today?
Did something happen?

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.740
I agree. You do seem
extra sentimental today, sir.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.600
Is something wrong?

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.710
My nickname is Mr. Autumn.
A man who gets sentimental in autumn.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.880
"Forsaking its thirsty master,
it vanished into autumn."

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.640
"A star falls from the bottle."

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.650
"And the heartbroken star
shatters softly in my chest."

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.320
Then again, how could you appreciate this?

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.290
The other day, I got some tips
from a good source,

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.320
and I chose to...

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.860
You chose to what?

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:17.430
In the clear autumn sun,
where could the wooden horse have gone?

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.370
- Never mind.
- What? Finish your sentence.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.000
What trouble have you caused now?
You were setting the stage for something.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.640
I told you, it's nothing.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.670
This autumn sun stirs my poetic soul,
and I must go wrestle with it.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:31.810
So I'm going to go on ahead.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.710
Hey, where do you think you're going?

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.880
We have a large group reservation tonight!

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.650
Yang Mal Sook.
When I called out your name,

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.250
you came to me and became my flower.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.750
- My pumpkin flower.
- Pumpkin flower?

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.160
Wait a second, isn't that customer...

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.490
actor Jang Dong Gun?

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.290
Jang Dong Gun? Where is he?

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.030
Hey, where are you going?

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.930
A five-dollar bill falls
in the lonely autumn wind.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.230
A five-dollar bill? Oh my goodness!

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.040
Hey! Oh Pan Sool!

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.270
He's got all sorts of escape tactics.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.980
So I guess it's Kyung Chae's world now.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.390
If she's back in the CEO's chair,
she must have powerful people backing her.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.650
Yes?

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.190
You won't be having the lunch I prepared,
will you?

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.960
I didn't set the table for you
as you said you'd get your own last time.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.470
What are you talking about?
Of course we'll eat together.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.970
What's a family for?

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.840
We're supposed to sit around the table...

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.240
and happily share a meal.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.550
Why the sudden change?

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.020
I thought you were still holding a grudge
for what happened last time.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.420
A grudge? Why would I?

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:51.290
It was only right for you
to side with Kyung Chae.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.730
Even if we fight with her,
you must always take her side from now on.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.060
The way you're suddenly acting...

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.630
is honestly a little scary.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:07.840
No, you have no idea how much
my husband and I support her.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.740
An unpleasant incident like last time
will never happen again.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.510
Honestly, it was all because
of that woman anyway.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.480
"That woman?"

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.350
You mean Madam Jung?

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.320
Madam Jung, my foot.
She's just that woman.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.860
What has gotten into you?

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:32.100
You used to call her "Mother"
and were always so deferential.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.360
My goodness!

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.570
For the record,

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.700
I have never acknowledged that woman
as my mother-in-law.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.080
- Hello.
- Have a seat.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.650
Could I see the Vice Director
for a moment?

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:53.820
Me?

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.250
You mean me, ma'am?

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.620
It'll just take a moment.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.790
This won't disrupt your team's work,
will it?

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:01.660
Of course not. It's no disruption.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.660
So what if you were?
The CEO herself is asking for me.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.100
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, I suppose you're right.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.570
But may I ask what this is regarding?

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.900
Hey, come on.
Why do you have to be so nosy?

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.940
The CEO must have her reasons
for summoning me.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.180
Ma'am, shall we?

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.360
Here, drink up.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.360
This is a tea I treasure.
I only serve it to special people.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.230
Special people?

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.630
Of course!
You're a special person to me.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.710
So you're saying the Vice Director
was just summoned to the CEO's office?

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.780
Something's definitely up.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.790
So, she came all this way
on purpose because of us?

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.920
It's obvious.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.190
Min Kyung Chae
won't get her own hands dirty.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.060
She'll use someone else to take us down.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.600
That sounds like Madam Jang's method.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.330
She avoids getting her hands dirty
by manipulating others to get her way.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:17.700
So then...

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.200
Madam Jang is pulling the strings
behind the scenes.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.840
Min Kyung Chae is just her pawn,

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.340
and Madam Jang is the one
calling all the shots.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:32.780
The problem is
our new enemy knows us way too well.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.120
So, from now on,
you're on Min Kyung Chae's side.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.220
Min Kyung Chae's side?

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.530
And on that note,

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.430
how much longer will you stay
in your current position?

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.860
Isn't it time you got a promotion?

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.600
You think I don't want a promotion?

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.530
I'm just stuck because it's not an option.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.100
Why wouldn't it be?
You've got me, the CEO.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.340
I'll make you the new director.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.770
What? You'll make me what?

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:59.080
The director.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.280
Take the director's office
that Soo Jung is using now.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.980
Wait, but what about Soo Jung?

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.980
She's had that job for long enough.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.450
It's long past time for a shake-up.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.500
This chair is something else.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.270
This is nice.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.540
(Director Min Soo Jung)

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.720
Hey! What are you doing in my chair?

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.590
It's nothing.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.150
Get out!

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.260
Keep up the good work.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:37.610
Wait, so you're saying Kyung Chae
offered you the director's position?

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.280
Yes, that's what I'm saying!

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.910
She called me to the CEO's office...

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.910
and told me to take Soo Jung's position.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.580
But why, all of a sudden?

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.080
For no reason at all?

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.990
It wasn't exactly for no reason.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:50.790
What was the reason then?

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.020
The thing is...

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.830
But there's one condition.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.300
In exchange for me
making you the director,

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.130
you and your wife have to
sign your shares over to me.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.200
I need to become the largest shareholder.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:08.140
That's the only way I can control Lucia
and protect Mingang.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.340
And you'll really make me the director?

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.010
Of course I will.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.980
Once I get rid of Lucia and Soo Jung,
who else will I have?

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.950
Only you.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.090
So if we sign all our shares over
to Kyung Chae,

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.760
you become the director?

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.860
That's the deal.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:30.890
And there's one more thing.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.330
She wants us to kick that woman
out of the house.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.470
Is everything okay at home?

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:37.770
Nothing has happened.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.100
That can't be.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.770
Ever since the Vice Director got back
from the CEO's office,

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.410
he's been grinning from ear to ear
about something.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.610
Min Kyung Chae must have offered him
a very tempting deal.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.110
Something he couldn't possibly refuse.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:54.280
If that's the case,
she must have promised him a promotion.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.720
He's always had a complex...

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.860
over his position being lower
than his two younger sisters,

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.290
so she must have preyed on that.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.730
Okay!

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.500
Let's give our shares to Kyung Chae
and get on her side.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.260
That seems like the best move, right?

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.970
Okay, then, from now on,
you and I need to stick together...

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.630
and kick that woman out of the house.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.000
That'll be a piece of cake.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.910
With your father in his condition,
she has no one to back her up.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:19.510
The timing couldn't be better.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:32.890
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.290
What is it, Se Ri? Can't you sleep?

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:41.700
I dozed off for a bit,
but a dream about Dad woke me up.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.270
A dream about the Chairman?

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.010
You must be the most worried
about him out of everyone.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.870
To be dreaming about him like that.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.540
I'm just so worried
that he might never wake up.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.950
I told you that's not going to happen.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.350
With how much you're worrying about him,
he's sure to wake up.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:18.700
Oh my goodness!

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.540
Sir, are you with us?

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.010
Doctor!

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:26.610
Doctor!

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:36.390
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)
