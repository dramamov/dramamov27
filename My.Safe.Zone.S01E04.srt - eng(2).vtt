00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:02.065
The restaurant is closed today.
Want to go to the beach?

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.865
I just made plans with Pie.

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:05.305
Who is the model?

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:06.905
You're gonna be so happy.

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:08.345
What were you talking about so long?

00:01:16.225 --> 00:01:18.105
Did Jane do all this by herself?

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:19.065
Jane, what's wrong?

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.385
Wouldn't you be mad if you saw me

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:21.865
with someone else like that?

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:24.105
But won't you at least hear me out?

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:26.385
If you always assume on your own,
how can we ever work?

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:34.505
I'M GRADUATING SOON
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER LESS

00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:36.105
IT'S BETTER WE KEEP SOME DISTANCE
SORRY, WHAN

00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:13.545
Why sit in the rain and get sick?

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:16.825
Whan broke up with me.

00:02:22.665 --> 00:02:23.905
Don't cry.

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:28.385
You still have me.

00:02:33.865 --> 00:02:36.425
MY DEAR FRIEND

00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:39.265
MY DEAR

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:41.105
Jane…

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:55.025
I don't have feelings for Pie.

00:03:27.265 --> 00:03:29.945
It's nothing more than work, I swear.

00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:42.785
If we shoot outdoors,
we should check the weather.

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:57.025
Lin.

00:03:57.105 --> 00:03:59.065
I'm sorry, I spilled water.

00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:00.785
It's fine, it's fine.

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:04.185
Here.

00:04:05.505 --> 00:04:07.705
My hands are wet…

00:04:07.785 --> 00:04:09.465
Could you wipe it for me?

00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:31.065
Lower down too.

00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:51.425
It's wet down there as well.

00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:09.145
Argue until you break up for good.

00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:21.785
Are you Pie?

00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:29.825
We had that investment meeting, remember?

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:32.145
Oh,

00:05:32.225 --> 00:05:34.425
Au, of course I remember.

00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:39.385
One whiskey on the rocks, please.

00:05:54.345 --> 00:05:55.985
Let's talk business first,

00:05:56.065 --> 00:05:57.905
personal later.

00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:48.785
SORRY, I'M NOT LOOKING TO INVEST
BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL ME FOR A DRINK

00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:05.385
Hello, what can I get for you?

00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:08.305
Two hot Americanos, no sugar.

00:08:08.385 --> 00:08:10.345
-Sure. And your name?
-Lin.

00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:11.265
Okay, Ms. Lin.

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:14.545
That'll be 155 baht. You can scan here.

00:08:19.185 --> 00:08:20.625
-Done.
-Thank you.

00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:43.545
-Lin?
-Whan?

00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:45.065
I thought you were in New York.

00:08:45.945 --> 00:08:47.785
How are you?

00:08:51.145 --> 00:08:52.025
I'm good.

00:08:53.545 --> 00:08:54.945
Ms. Lin, your coffee is ready.

00:08:55.025 --> 00:08:56.425
Thank you.

00:08:59.425 --> 00:09:00.665
Are you here with Jane?

00:09:01.785 --> 00:09:02.825
No, I'm alone.

00:09:03.425 --> 00:09:05.545
You ordered two cups.
I thought you came together.

00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:09.105
I'm on my way to see Jane now.

00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:19.785
I never apologized to you in person.

00:09:20.865 --> 00:09:21.705
For what?

00:09:27.545 --> 00:09:29.145
For breaking up with you.

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:37.665
Jane never told you

00:09:37.745 --> 00:09:40.185
why I broke up with you?

00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:42.465
Never.

00:09:42.545 --> 00:09:44.265
But I figured

00:09:44.345 --> 00:09:46.665
you just got bored and wanted someone new.

00:09:48.065 --> 00:09:49.425
That's not it.

00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:51.745
Even though
I did have someone else back then,

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:53.705
I never wanted to break up with you.

00:09:58.185 --> 00:09:59.905
Jane asked me to break up with you.

00:10:04.305 --> 00:10:05.345
Jane?

00:10:08.665 --> 00:10:10.705
She saw me with someone else

00:10:10.785 --> 00:10:12.105
before you even knew.

00:10:47.825 --> 00:10:50.865
Lin loves you so much.
How could you do this to her?

00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:54.185
It's nothing serious with this one.

00:10:54.265 --> 00:10:56.745
But Lin's too good to be just an option.

00:10:57.305 --> 00:10:59.585
If you can't commit to her alone,
then break up.

00:11:00.625 --> 00:11:04.345
Breaking up because you don't love her
is better than letting her stay blind.

00:11:08.545 --> 00:11:09.865
If you don't,

00:11:10.465 --> 00:11:12.665
I'll tell the teachers
you've been selling test answers.

00:11:47.385 --> 00:11:49.545
Jane! Jane!

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:55.585
Jane, can we talk?

00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:01.265
Are you really not going to talk to me?

00:12:16.865 --> 00:12:18.545
Here.

00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:19.785
-Alright.
-Are these all?

00:12:20.305 --> 00:12:22.185
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:12:32.225 --> 00:12:33.985
She's been sitting there forever.

00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:37.345
Yeah,

00:12:39.065 --> 00:12:40.945
why doesn't Jane
just come out and see her?

00:12:42.705 --> 00:12:43.705
Right?

00:12:44.545 --> 00:12:46.865
-How would I know?
-I thought you'd know.

00:12:50.585 --> 00:12:51.625
Hello.

00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:52.905
Hello.

00:12:52.985 --> 00:12:54.225
Isn't it hot out here?

00:13:00.545 --> 00:13:02.825
How can she sit there, it's boiling.

00:13:03.465 --> 00:13:04.865
Yeah.

00:13:05.465 --> 00:13:07.265
-Training for hell, maybe.
-You're crazy!

00:13:10.865 --> 00:13:11.945
-We're heading inside.
-Yeah.

00:13:29.665 --> 00:13:33.625
It's just as hot in here as it is outside.

00:13:34.545 --> 00:13:36.265
Keep it down.

00:13:36.345 --> 00:13:37.705
Look at her face.

00:13:40.105 --> 00:13:41.225
Jane…

00:13:42.665 --> 00:13:45.265
Lin's still waiting outside.

00:13:50.825 --> 00:13:52.985
You're not going out to her?

00:14:00.945 --> 00:14:03.545
When she's quiet,
I feel like I'm butting in.

00:14:04.425 --> 00:14:05.825
At least you know.

00:14:08.785 --> 00:14:11.265
If you two were me, what would you do?

00:14:14.785 --> 00:14:18.265
Maybe tell us the whole story first?

00:14:34.705 --> 00:14:36.145
Oh, Jane!

00:14:36.665 --> 00:14:37.745
Jane!

00:14:42.265 --> 00:14:43.505
You can stay mad,

00:14:43.585 --> 00:14:45.345
but at least let me bandage you first.

00:15:00.265 --> 00:15:01.545
Does it hurt much?

00:15:05.385 --> 00:15:07.425
How did you cut yourself?

00:15:19.905 --> 00:15:21.585
Because of me, right?

00:15:38.025 --> 00:15:39.265
I'm sorry.

00:15:44.385 --> 00:15:46.985
Don't you love me anymore?
Why won't you believe me?

00:15:49.825 --> 00:15:51.865
What do you expect me to think?

00:15:51.945 --> 00:15:55.065
You say it's nothing,
but what I saw wasn't nothing.

00:15:55.145 --> 00:15:56.305
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:15:56.385 --> 00:15:59.265
She spilled water.
I just helped wipe it off.

00:15:59.345 --> 00:16:00.905
On her shirt?

00:16:00.985 --> 00:16:02.025
Yes.

00:16:02.105 --> 00:16:04.625
So you had to unbutton it to wipe?

00:16:09.545 --> 00:16:11.305
Why couldn't she do it herself?

00:16:12.025 --> 00:16:14.425
She asked me. Her hands were wet.

00:16:15.785 --> 00:16:19.345
I swear, Jane, it's not what you think.

00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:33.105
I need time.

00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:37.065
I can give you time.

00:16:37.785 --> 00:16:41.465
But I won't let you turn your back on me
for something I never did.

00:16:57.745 --> 00:17:00.305
How's the bandaging going?

00:17:02.225 --> 00:17:05.145
Relationships are complicated.
You wouldn't get it.

00:17:07.345 --> 00:17:08.385
Hey.

00:17:08.464 --> 00:17:11.305
It's not complicated at all.

00:17:11.385 --> 00:17:14.545
No money, no love. Done.

00:17:16.145 --> 00:17:20.065
They love each other.
Love wounds take time to heal.

00:17:22.385 --> 00:17:23.625
Love wounds take time to heal!

00:17:24.865 --> 00:17:27.025
Geez, why'd you sneak up on me like that?

00:17:27.105 --> 00:17:29.105
Why'd you get spooked so easily?

00:17:29.185 --> 00:17:30.025
Look.

00:17:41.145 --> 00:17:42.425
Are you two finished prepping?

00:17:43.425 --> 00:17:44.785
Yes.

00:17:47.385 --> 00:17:48.345
See?

00:17:48.865 --> 00:17:50.545
Love wounds take time.

00:18:04.105 --> 00:18:05.345
Can we drink now?

00:18:06.265 --> 00:18:09.145
It's work hours.

00:18:39.025 --> 00:18:39.945
Yeah!

00:18:40.025 --> 00:18:42.505
It feels great!

00:18:42.585 --> 00:18:43.425
Great!

00:18:47.505 --> 00:18:48.345
Tell me honestly.

00:18:48.985 --> 00:18:50.305
Can I really trust her?

00:18:51.905 --> 00:18:52.745
Well,

00:18:53.505 --> 00:18:55.345
from what you said,

00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:57.625
if I were you, I would believe her.

00:18:59.385 --> 00:19:03.065
I'm lovesick.
If she asked me to, I'd do anything.

00:19:04.665 --> 00:19:05.865
True.

00:19:06.385 --> 00:19:08.745
That's why you blew all your money
and work like crazy now.

00:19:09.625 --> 00:19:12.745
Got scammed by a guy
just so he could spoil his girl.

00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:16.745
I loved him, so what?

00:19:16.825 --> 00:19:19.345
If love means paying like you did,

00:19:19.425 --> 00:19:21.905
I'd rather hire a gigolo.

00:19:24.465 --> 00:19:25.705
That's right.

00:19:27.225 --> 00:19:30.465
Hey, Bam! You little…

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:35.225
Did you just curse me in front of Jane?

00:19:35.305 --> 00:19:36.185
Hey!

00:19:36.265 --> 00:19:37.705
Yeah, I did.

00:19:40.985 --> 00:19:43.385
Ah, alright.

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:47.025
Let's focus. We got sidetracked.

00:19:47.945 --> 00:19:48.785
Let's talk.

00:19:49.385 --> 00:19:51.625
The real question is

00:19:51.705 --> 00:19:54.105
how much do you trust her?

00:19:54.785 --> 00:19:57.425
If you do, don't question it.

00:19:58.145 --> 00:19:59.305
Exactly.

00:19:59.385 --> 00:20:00.345
You want me to be a fool?

00:20:01.905 --> 00:20:04.225
You aren't blind.

00:20:04.305 --> 00:20:06.225
You know Lin better than us.

00:20:06.945 --> 00:20:08.145
After all this time,

00:20:08.945 --> 00:20:10.825
has she been faithful

00:20:11.465 --> 00:20:14.425
or slutty?

00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:18.025
-Who's like that?
-You.

00:20:18.105 --> 00:20:19.385
Hey!

00:20:21.385 --> 00:20:22.745
Lin only loves one person at a time.

00:20:57.825 --> 00:20:59.065
Wanna grab food after this?

00:20:59.145 --> 00:21:00.825
Sure. What should we eat?

00:21:00.905 --> 00:21:02.465
-I feel like…
-I'm hungry.

00:21:04.985 --> 00:21:06.025
Lin's coming.

00:21:06.105 --> 00:21:08.225
Oh, let's go.

00:21:11.385 --> 00:21:12.625
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Lin.

00:21:41.665 --> 00:21:42.665
Lin.

00:21:49.585 --> 00:21:50.625
I'm sorry

00:21:51.385 --> 00:21:52.625
for making you feel bad.

00:22:13.385 --> 00:22:16.785
I'm the one who should apologize
for not trusting you.

00:22:27.705 --> 00:22:31.145
I should've asked you instead of assuming.

00:22:35.745 --> 00:22:38.065
If you don't want me working with Pie,

00:22:39.385 --> 00:22:40.945
then I won't.

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:46.305
If it comes down to choosing
between work and you,

00:22:48.465 --> 00:22:49.945
I'll always choose you.

00:22:50.785 --> 00:22:53.065
You're happy when you're shooting.

00:22:53.145 --> 00:22:56.385
It's the job you love
and you're good at it.

00:22:59.465 --> 00:23:01.545
But I acted stupid,

00:23:02.425 --> 00:23:04.585
starting a fight over nothing.

00:23:07.145 --> 00:23:08.625
I'm sorry.

00:23:13.385 --> 00:23:15.865
Sorry for making you feel this way.

00:23:27.025 --> 00:23:28.785
I'm awful,

00:23:29.345 --> 00:23:32.145
making you choose
between me and your work.

00:23:36.545 --> 00:23:38.785
I'm sorry for not trusting you,

00:23:39.305 --> 00:23:42.465
when you're the one I should trust most.

00:23:44.265 --> 00:23:45.385
I'm sorry.

00:24:20.905 --> 00:24:22.185
Listen, Jane.

00:24:25.465 --> 00:24:28.305
I know how much it hurts to be betrayed.

00:24:31.185 --> 00:24:34.745
I would never, ever hurt you like that.

00:25:07.705 --> 00:25:10.185
From now on, no matter what,

00:25:12.065 --> 00:25:13.705
I'll always choose you.

00:25:20.425 --> 00:25:22.865
You're the most
important thing in my life.

00:27:14.305 --> 00:27:15.305
Guess what?

00:27:16.585 --> 00:27:18.585
I ran into Whan this morning.

00:27:20.345 --> 00:27:22.145
Our senior from school?

00:27:25.545 --> 00:27:26.465
Yeah.

00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:32.665
She told me about you.

00:27:36.385 --> 00:27:37.865
I just found out

00:27:38.425 --> 00:27:39.745
it was your doing.

00:27:44.745 --> 00:27:46.505
When she dumped you,

00:27:47.425 --> 00:27:49.065
I was secretly thrilled.

00:27:50.265 --> 00:27:51.705
But I pretended to be sad.

00:27:53.905 --> 00:27:57.185
Then why didn't you just tell me
you liked me back then?

00:27:58.105 --> 00:27:59.265
I didn't dare.

00:28:00.465 --> 00:28:03.345
Funny, isn't it? I could threaten her,

00:28:03.905 --> 00:28:05.465
but I couldn't confess to you.

00:28:11.985 --> 00:28:15.265
From now on, you have to say it.

00:28:17.705 --> 00:28:19.465
If you don't like something, tell me.

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:22.585
If you're jealous, tell me.

00:28:24.225 --> 00:28:25.345
If you love me, tell me.

00:28:32.505 --> 00:28:34.305
Don't keep it bottled up.

00:28:35.425 --> 00:28:38.585
I don't want to fight with you anymore.

00:28:44.865 --> 00:28:46.585
You're mine now, Jane.

00:28:55.265 --> 00:28:56.145
Jane.

00:29:08.625 --> 00:29:09.665
I'm not available.

00:29:12.345 --> 00:29:14.705
Was my offer too low?

00:29:15.465 --> 00:29:16.425
So,

00:29:17.105 --> 00:29:19.625
what price works for you?

00:29:19.705 --> 00:29:22.745
If it's possible, I'll pay it.

00:29:22.825 --> 00:29:25.825
It's not about money.
I just don't take catering jobs.

00:29:28.545 --> 00:29:31.745
But this could be your debut
in our magazine.

00:29:32.385 --> 00:29:35.585
I could even write
a feature column on you.

00:29:37.265 --> 00:29:40.065
I need to prep food
for the evening service.

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:41.705
If I go off-site,

00:29:41.785 --> 00:29:44.305
I won't have enough staff
to prepare for my customers.

00:29:44.905 --> 00:29:47.465
So you mean

00:29:47.985 --> 00:29:51.505
even if I pay any amount, you still won't?

00:29:52.345 --> 00:29:54.265
Correct. I won't.

00:29:57.705 --> 00:29:59.425
To be blunt, Pie.

00:29:59.505 --> 00:30:01.225
I don't want to work with you.

00:30:02.305 --> 00:30:04.265
We're in different fields.

00:30:04.345 --> 00:30:06.585
Food and fashion? We won't get along.

00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:09.145
So, I don't want to do it.

00:30:16.545 --> 00:30:20.225
They say sharp tongue, delicious food.

00:30:21.305 --> 00:30:22.625
I guess that's true.

00:30:25.625 --> 00:30:27.305
My sharp tongue is
reserved for certain people.

00:30:32.545 --> 00:30:33.385
Wait.

00:30:36.825 --> 00:30:40.225
And doing something like spilling water
on yourself to cause misunderstandings,

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:41.465
just stop it.

00:31:00.185 --> 00:31:01.145
Lin.

00:31:01.225 --> 00:31:02.265
Pie?

00:31:04.585 --> 00:31:06.625
Can you talk to Jane for me?

00:31:06.705 --> 00:31:08.745
I wanted to impress Ayla

00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:11.625
so I asked Jane to cook
and send to the set,

00:31:11.705 --> 00:31:12.985
but she refused.

00:31:14.185 --> 00:31:15.705
Maybe she's really not available.

00:31:15.785 --> 00:31:17.305
Why not try another vendor?

00:31:17.985 --> 00:31:19.345
But her restaurant is famous.

00:31:19.985 --> 00:31:22.065
Having her food on set
would be such a statement.

00:31:22.585 --> 00:31:24.825
Can you talk to her?

00:31:27.265 --> 00:31:28.425
I'll try,

00:31:29.145 --> 00:31:30.985
but I doubt she'll agree.

00:31:33.985 --> 00:31:35.105
Thanks, Lin.

00:31:35.825 --> 00:31:38.305
I really want Jane's food there.

00:31:38.985 --> 00:31:41.385
Whatever she can manage, I'll take it.

00:31:41.465 --> 00:31:43.665
I'm happy with any dish.

00:31:43.745 --> 00:31:46.025
Just having her name is enough.

00:31:48.865 --> 00:31:50.425
I'll see what I can do.

00:31:52.705 --> 00:31:53.665
Thank you.

00:32:12.105 --> 00:32:13.265
You ran into her outside?

00:32:20.585 --> 00:32:22.225
She asked you to talk to me, right?

00:32:24.385 --> 00:32:25.225
Yeah.

00:32:26.105 --> 00:32:27.705
I'm not going.

00:32:31.865 --> 00:32:32.905
I know.

00:32:34.505 --> 00:32:36.465
Then why even try to speak for her?

00:32:40.105 --> 00:32:41.585
Are you mad, little Jane?

00:32:43.705 --> 00:32:45.905
I'm only two hours younger.

00:32:47.425 --> 00:32:48.905
I'm your girlfriend,

00:32:50.705 --> 00:32:52.705
and a jealous one, too.

00:32:55.425 --> 00:32:57.145
I knew you wouldn't want to go.

00:32:58.025 --> 00:33:01.225
I'll just tell her I asked
but you really can't.

00:33:01.305 --> 00:33:02.145
Okay?

00:33:04.105 --> 00:33:05.345
Next time,

00:33:05.985 --> 00:33:07.865
don't bother trying to spare her feelings.

00:33:09.985 --> 00:33:11.625
But Pie and I still have to work together.

00:33:12.225 --> 00:33:13.985
I need to keep things civil.

00:33:17.265 --> 00:33:18.505
Fine.

00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:23.905
So, what can I help you with?

00:33:27.385 --> 00:33:29.065
That restaurant is not even that famous.

00:33:29.145 --> 00:33:30.785
Why is she so stuck-up?

00:33:48.905 --> 00:33:52.625
MY BALANCE

00:33:56.385 --> 00:33:58.465
If I can't get funding soon,

00:33:58.985 --> 00:34:00.705
the company will have to close.

00:34:05.745 --> 00:34:06.585
What is it?

00:34:09.945 --> 00:34:12.425
I found the photographer
you've been looking for.

00:34:41.985 --> 00:34:43.225
Lin.

00:34:44.945 --> 00:34:47.105
Why does Aunt Aom like Kate so much?

00:34:55.304 --> 00:34:56.145
Money, maybe.

00:35:02.825 --> 00:35:04.025
Just money?

00:35:06.225 --> 00:35:07.305
Not really.

00:35:08.305 --> 00:35:09.945
At first, Mom didn't even like Kate.

00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:12.465
But she still won her over.

00:35:13.905 --> 00:35:14.785
Yeah.

00:35:16.465 --> 00:35:18.825
At first, Mom wasn't okay
with me dating a woman.

00:35:19.825 --> 00:35:22.065
Older folks don't always understand.

00:35:23.305 --> 00:35:25.345
But Kate showed her

00:35:25.425 --> 00:35:27.385
it wasn't wrong,

00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.145
and she treated Mom so well.

00:35:32.265 --> 00:35:35.985
In the end, Mom loved Kate more than me.

00:35:40.585 --> 00:35:41.985
She even told me

00:35:42.585 --> 00:35:44.585
it was better I dated women.

00:35:45.305 --> 00:35:48.185
At least I wouldn't face
what she went through.

00:35:48.265 --> 00:35:50.705
That's what I don't get, Jane.

00:35:51.545 --> 00:35:54.825
Why would she want me
to turn a blind eye and stay with Kate?

00:35:56.185 --> 00:35:57.385
You know,

00:35:57.465 --> 00:36:00.185
I still remember
chasing after my dad's car

00:36:00.265 --> 00:36:02.145
the day he left.

00:36:02.225 --> 00:36:04.025
How can Mom forget that?

00:36:10.705 --> 00:36:12.465
Maybe Aunt Aom
just wants you to live comfortably.

00:36:13.105 --> 00:36:15.305
She's worked so hard her whole life.

00:36:16.225 --> 00:36:17.985
She doesn't want you to struggle the same.

00:36:21.545 --> 00:36:23.385
Money buys a lot,

00:36:23.465 --> 00:36:25.145
maybe everything.

00:36:25.745 --> 00:36:28.265
But if it means being blind and stupid,

00:36:29.625 --> 00:36:31.665
I'd rather earn my own and keep my pride.

00:37:24.185 --> 00:37:25.905
Why are you smiling to yourself?

00:37:29.385 --> 00:37:32.465
Lin, no, I haven't even showered yet.

00:37:32.545 --> 00:37:34.185
You smell so good.

00:37:36.985 --> 00:37:37.985
Lin.

00:37:38.825 --> 00:37:40.145
I'm going to shower.

00:37:47.385 --> 00:37:48.385
Jane.

00:37:56.825 --> 00:37:58.345
When I shoot for the magazine,

00:37:59.345 --> 00:38:00.505
come with me.

00:38:02.985 --> 00:38:04.585
Did Pie put you up to this?

00:38:06.465 --> 00:38:08.265
No.

00:38:11.745 --> 00:38:13.665
I just want you there.

00:38:14.505 --> 00:38:15.985
So you'll feel at ease.

00:38:18.225 --> 00:38:20.825
You'll see for yourself.

00:38:21.425 --> 00:38:22.785
It's only work with Pie.

00:38:24.985 --> 00:38:26.065
At first,

00:38:27.425 --> 00:38:29.905
I thought you wanted me
to shower with you.

00:38:37.065 --> 00:38:39.225
I already showered.

00:38:39.305 --> 00:38:40.585
I know.

00:38:41.665 --> 00:38:42.825
I was teasing.

00:38:43.985 --> 00:38:45.625
I'll go shower now.

00:38:51.425 --> 00:38:52.745
I'll go now.

00:38:57.905 --> 00:38:59.465
But now,

00:39:00.985 --> 00:39:02.465
I think I want another shower.

00:41:43.185 --> 00:41:44.025
MAIL BOX

00:41:48.585 --> 00:41:49.745
INBOX

00:41:49.825 --> 00:41:50.945
NO EMAIL

00:42:09.305 --> 00:42:10.905
Ms. Lin is here.

00:42:12.465 --> 00:42:13.785
Did she come alone?

00:42:13.865 --> 00:42:15.465
She's with another woman.

00:42:16.145 --> 00:42:17.065
Really?

00:42:18.705 --> 00:42:20.065
I'll go take care of her myself.

00:42:20.665 --> 00:42:21.665
Sure.

00:42:32.225 --> 00:42:33.145
Lin.

00:42:36.425 --> 00:42:37.385
Want something to eat?

00:42:38.385 --> 00:42:39.905
I don't want to keep Ayla waiting.

00:42:42.305 --> 00:42:43.665
It's almost done, right?

00:42:43.745 --> 00:42:45.025
Yes.

00:42:45.625 --> 00:42:48.625
Then can we talk a bit?

00:42:54.745 --> 00:42:55.905
About work.

00:43:01.625 --> 00:43:03.065
What is it?

00:43:04.705 --> 00:43:07.225
Can we go somewhere private?

00:43:10.225 --> 00:43:11.585
Okay, wait a sec.

00:43:13.785 --> 00:43:15.945
Jane…

00:43:16.785 --> 00:43:17.985
I'll go talk to Pie for a bit.

00:43:19.745 --> 00:43:20.865
Then…

00:43:21.905 --> 00:43:22.825
I'll wait here.

00:43:24.305 --> 00:43:25.145
Okay.

00:43:25.225 --> 00:43:26.065
I'll be right back.

00:43:27.585 --> 00:43:28.665
Let's go.

00:43:35.625 --> 00:43:38.105
I know you've got
a stable career in New York,

00:43:38.785 --> 00:43:42.065
and your magazine credits

00:43:42.145 --> 00:43:43.665
are way better than mine.

00:43:43.745 --> 00:43:46.545
But I want you to consider this.

00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:50.185
What if we start
an online magazine together?

00:43:51.345 --> 00:43:52.545
Would you be interested?

00:43:55.145 --> 00:43:56.785
Are you asking me
to be your business partner?

00:43:56.865 --> 00:43:57.905
Yes.

00:43:58.505 --> 00:44:03.025
To keep you, I have to make you
an offer you can't refuse.

00:44:04.225 --> 00:44:06.945
Just signing you as a photographer

00:44:07.025 --> 00:44:08.425
wouldn't be enough.

00:44:13.465 --> 00:44:15.465
It's tempting.

00:44:16.425 --> 00:44:17.985
But can I think about it first?

00:44:20.505 --> 00:44:21.585
I understand.

00:44:21.665 --> 00:44:24.745
Walking away from a great job
takes thought.

00:44:24.825 --> 00:44:26.945
But let me know soon.

00:44:40.705 --> 00:44:42.985
Jane, let's go over there.

00:44:44.625 --> 00:44:45.465
Where?

00:44:46.065 --> 00:44:47.745
I want to talk with you alone.

00:44:51.465 --> 00:44:52.545
Come on.

00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:54.305
We can't.

00:44:55.545 --> 00:44:58.105
It's a set. There are too many people.

00:44:58.705 --> 00:45:00.025
We can't do it here.

00:45:00.745 --> 00:45:02.425
I just need to talk.

00:45:04.425 --> 00:45:07.705
I mean it. It's a secret, okay?

00:45:10.025 --> 00:45:11.145
Let's go.

00:45:24.185 --> 00:45:25.345
What secret?

00:45:32.745 --> 00:45:33.865
Pie asked me to be her partner.

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:35.465
Partner?

00:45:36.545 --> 00:45:39.985
She's starting an online project
and wants me in.

00:45:41.225 --> 00:45:44.345
She could just hire you.
You already have work in New York.

00:45:45.985 --> 00:45:49.545
She wants me to leave New York
and work here with her.

00:45:51.145 --> 00:45:53.945
If it were anyone else, I wouldn't mind.

00:45:54.025 --> 00:45:55.265
But Pie?

00:45:58.305 --> 00:45:59.625
She's not trustworthy.

00:46:02.825 --> 00:46:05.665
But wouldn't it be nice?
I could stay with you,

00:46:05.745 --> 00:46:06.985
no more flights back and forth.

00:46:08.865 --> 00:46:10.345
That would be good.

00:46:11.065 --> 00:46:11.905
So?

00:46:13.425 --> 00:46:14.465
Let me think.

00:46:15.065 --> 00:46:15.905
Oh?

00:46:15.985 --> 00:46:16.985
I'm going.

00:46:24.185 --> 00:46:24.985
Jane!

00:46:25.065 --> 00:46:26.745
Lin got clipped by a car.
She must be hurt.

00:46:26.825 --> 00:46:27.905
Let's check on her.

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:29.025
Let's check on Lin.

00:46:30.105 --> 00:46:31.345
I know

00:46:31.425 --> 00:46:34.945
it's hard at first, but over time,

00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:36.585
anger can fade.

00:46:36.665 --> 00:46:39.705
When it does,
you might be ready to listen.

00:46:39.785 --> 00:46:42.985
I'm sorry I disappointed you, Mom.

00:46:43.665 --> 00:46:45.905
But I will never get back with Kate.

00:46:49.385 --> 00:46:51.185
Jane! Jane!

00:46:54.065 --> 00:46:54.945
Jane!

00:47:20.825 --> 00:47:23.425
