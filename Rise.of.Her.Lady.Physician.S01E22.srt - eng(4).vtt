=I've Seen Through Your Stupid Trick!=

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.720
Thank you for telling me this.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.320
I shall take my leave.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.800
Have you found any clues
from Her Highness?

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.040
I've already checked every step

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.240
but found nothing wrong.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.880
What am I missing?

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.080
It's getting hotter and hotter.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.560
I heard that Lord Wu even
proposed to His Majesty

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.920
that all water used in the palace
must be boiled first.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.480
We can't drink cold water
drawn from the well.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.720
Why?

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.920
Why do we have to
drink hot water on hot days?

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.240
Wouldn't that make it even hotter?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.120
Lord Wu said

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.000
it could prevent insect eggs.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.510
But the well water

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.040
looks quite clean.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.880
Your Highness.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.040
I got it!

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.480
It's water!

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.320
Your Majesty,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.840
based on my careful investigation,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.600
the cause of the premature delivery

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.440
lies in the water used for decoction.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.280
Someone secretly replaced it

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.960
with water boiled in a copper pot.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.880
What's wrong with

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.520
that?

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.360
Water boiled in a copper pot

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.280
will greatly change the nature of herbs,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.680
making them harmful.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.120
Moreover, this method cannot
be detected with a silver needle.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.680
Someone replaced
the water used for decoction

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.320
with water boiled in a copper pot,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.120
and I unknowingly used it.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.160
In this way,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.120
it is the same as making a decoction
in a copper pot,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.920
which

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.960
caused the Princess Consort's
premature delivery.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.480
I can't believe it.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.800
Do you know

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.880
who did it?

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.960
Your Majesty,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.440
I don't know.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.880
Your Majesty,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.040
I've heard

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.760
we got a spirit cat
from abroad as tribute.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.640
This cat is extremely intelligent

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.800
and can detect
whether a person is telling the truth.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.520
The person may answer questions

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.320
with their hands on its body.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.640
If it's the truth,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.560
the cat will remain calm.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.280
If it's a lie,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.480
the cat will become restless.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.680
I suggest we use this cat.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.600
Perhaps it can help us
find the real culprit.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.000
This is so ridiculous.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.680
Your Majesty,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.680
this method sounds very mysterious,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.640
but in order to uncover the truth,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.640
I'm also

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.000
willing to give it a try.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.320
Guards,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.880
bring the spirit cat here.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.600
In addition,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.440
bring all personnel involved
from the bureau

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.560
here and

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.760
inspect them one by one.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.320
Aye.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.660
Your Majesty,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.600
the cat fears light

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.520
and will become agitated
when it sees light.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.120
We need to extinguish the candles.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.920
Do it.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.080
Aye.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.560
Did you tamper with the water?

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.440
No.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.000
Did you go to the Decoction Office?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.000
No.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.920
Did you change the water?

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.320
No.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.560
Did you change the water?

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.160
No.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.400
Did you go to the Decoction Office?

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.680
No.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.360
Did you change the water?

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.400
No.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.760
Did you go to the Decoction Office?

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.360
Did you tamper with the water?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.000
No, I didn't.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.440
Lord Feng,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.280
did you tamper with the decoction

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.920
for Her Highness?

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.560
Did you ever change the water?

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.120
Officer Song, you're so funny.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.440
How could I possibly harm Her Highness?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.760
I

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.880
didn't change the water.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.760
You've inspected everyone.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.160
However,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.320
the cat hasn't made a sound.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.880
Your Majesty,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.600
we may light the candles.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.360
Light the candles.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.800
Everyone,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.520
please extend your right hand.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.040
Attendant Wu,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.000
why is your hand so clean?

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.760
Were you too guilty

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.120
to place your hand on the spirit cat?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.520
Answer me!

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.280
Everyone,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.560
the cat is fake.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.280
We just played a lie detection game.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.080
Lord Song and I

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.200
had applied charcoal powder

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.160
onto the black fur ball.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.360
An innocent person

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.000
would naturally dare
to place their hands on it.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.240
But if the person is guilty,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.240
they definitely wouldn't dare.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.160
Well, Lord Feng,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.560
why didn't you reach out your hand?

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.520
Lord Feng,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.520
are you afraid?

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.160
Or could it be

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.240
that your hand

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.520
is also clean?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.240
I just find

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.000
such a trick too ridiculous,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.160
and I don't

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.280
want to be a part of it.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.600
You're still denying it.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.840
Feng Mingyuan,

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.480
show me your hand!

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.870
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.320
(I've seen through)

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.600
(your stupid trick.)

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.160
Attendant Wu,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.360
with solid evidence,
are you still going to deny it?

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.040
Did you change the water
used for the decoction?

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.600
Spare me, Your Majesty!

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.360
I did

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.000
change the water.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.920
I...

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.600
I had no choice!

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.480
Who ordered you to do this?

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.120
Guards,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.360
drag her away

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.840
and interrogate her thoroughly.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.840
Your Majesty, have mercy!

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.120
I'll say it!

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:01.980
I'll say it!

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.040
It was...

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.360
It was Minister Feng who ordered me

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.040
to replace it

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.680
with water boiled in a copper pot.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.120
Not just that,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.440
the plague as well!

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.080
It was also Lord Feng

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.440
who lured Rong Zelan to Su Ye's side

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.200
to make her fall ill

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.540
so that he could get rid of her!

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.570
I've said everything I know!

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.720
Your Majesty!

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.080
Please spare my life!

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.120
Your Majesty!

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.240
He forced me into this!

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.040
Attendant Wu,

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.000
I heard you stole medicine

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.920
because of your sick brother.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.920
Tell me,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.200
did you really steal it
for your brother?

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.400
Minister Feng,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.320
I... I'm so sorry.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.600
I'll never steal medicine
from the pharmacy again.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.040
Don't be afraid.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.600
You only need to be a good girl

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.960
and do whatever

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.440
I tell you to do.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.120
If you can complete the mission,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.360
I won't

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.880
send you to the Office of Punishment.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.840
What do you think?

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.880
I got it.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.800
I will follow your orders.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.360
Okay.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.400
Your Majesty, I'm innocent!

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.440
Attendant Wu is talking nonsense

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.680
and slandering me!

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.000
I...

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.440
I'm innocent!

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.040
Lord Feng,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.680
we've got the evidence and witness.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.920
How dare you deny it?

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.320
Why is your mouth

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.880
as stiff as a dead duck's beak?

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.400
Your Majesty!

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.480
It's getting hotter.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.840
I asked Attendant Wu
to boil the well water

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.520
only to kill insect eggs.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.120
Every year in this season,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.080
we always boil well water
before drinking.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.680
Besides, even if I had her

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.960
boil the well water,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.680
how could it

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.880
be poisonous?

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.200
We all drink

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.640
boiled water,

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.080
but no one has been poisoned!

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.280
Minister Feng,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.560
we've been emphasizing

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.600
that the decoction used
water boiled in a copper pot.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.400
I will now prove to you

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.480
whether such a decoction

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.600
is poisonous or not.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.120
Look at you!

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.360
After I discovered the problem,

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.080
I secretly asked Officer Song to

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.520
replace the water you used

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.280
for making tea and tonic soup

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.320
with water boiled in a copper pot.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.840
Look at you,

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.080
your hair is falling out.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.320
How dare you say it's not poisonous?
