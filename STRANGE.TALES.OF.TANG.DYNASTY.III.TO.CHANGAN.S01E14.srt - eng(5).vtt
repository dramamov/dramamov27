[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.009
[Episode 14]

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.950
To be honest,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.039
I've loved

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.280
folk storytelling since I was a child.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.610
Sir,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.160
what story will you tell us today?

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.200
I want to go to the capital,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.840
but I got lost here.

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.890
Could you give me directions?

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.400
Well...

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.490
Didn't you say

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.680
you'd let me in to rest for a bit?

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.930
I said...

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.430
we'd rest together.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.470
You're so naughty.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.750
Sounds like...

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.670
neither the scholar nor the lady

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.100
were human.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.430
Indeed.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.800
What a pity for that lady.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.730
Can't you tell something else?

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.520
Your story is too scary.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.180
Scary as it may be,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.200
everyone loves to hear it.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.430
Don't believe me?

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.620
Ask everyone here.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.840
General,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.870
this story is too frightening.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.940
Don't you agree?

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.740
-Let's stop listening.
-Sir.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.120
Don't be afraid.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.520
As long as you have this Bai Ze Scroll,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.010
whether you're traveling

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.750
or staying home,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.710
it'll ward off evil

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.340
and keep you safe.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.840
Only 90 cash each.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.630
[Bai Ze Scroll]

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.710
Fair price.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.390
So you two as a couple,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.210
one tells ghost stories

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.630
and the other uses them to sell scrolls.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.010
You're no hermits.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.560
You're merchants!

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.470
The temple keeper
is generous and kind-hearted.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.940
Travelers can rest here

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.210
for free,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.370
food and shelter included.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.620
But as time goes by,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.750
how can we afford it?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.120
I can only

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.290
do some sewing to get by.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.450
Why don't you...

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.380
buy a cloth doll?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.810
Only 100 cash.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.120
How much?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.400
100 cash?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.910
Come on.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.310
Look at them.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.670
The dolls you made

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.430
all look strange,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.610
like burial figurines.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.940
And 100 cash?

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.870
Who would buy them? Come on.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.560
Yes.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.970
Since no one would buy them...

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.180
I can only sell them to ghosts.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.310
But this Bai Ze Scroll is different.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.190
It's specifically for humans
to ward off ghosts.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.430
Isn't that still just selling things?

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.040
Just nonsense.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.320
Nowadays in Chang'an,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.440
a bushel of rice
sells for only a dozen cash,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.040
and you're charging 90 cash for a scroll.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.040
Aren't you being too greedy?

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.190
That's right.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.390
They say all merchants are cunning.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.830
See?

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.159
Just as expected.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.300
You sly merchants.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.420
What do you know?

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.750
This Bai Ze Scroll

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.360
is an original from the Western Zhou.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.620
The drawings of ghosts

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.560
and the methods

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.880
to subdue them

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.440
are extremely accurate.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.500
You're saying this is an original
from the Western Zhou?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.900
May I take a look?

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.940
90 cash.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.120
I just want to take a look.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.830
If it really is from the Western Zhou,

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.720
I'll buy it.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.420
Don't get it dirty.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.230
He actually believes it?

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.970
What happened

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:43.770
to that scholar

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.680
and that lady in the end?

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.190
-Yeah.
-Go on.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.650
I won't stay to listen.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.980
I'm really too tired.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.800
I won't listen anymore.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.730
Well, Wei,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.060
please go rest in the west wing first.

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.190
I just checked.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.950
The west wing is one big room

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.840
for 4 people.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.980
It's not spacious,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.880
but it'll do.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.800
Ding, guys,

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.220
please bear with it.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.640
What about the east wing?

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.940
The east wing is divided into 2 rooms.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.650
One is for Commander Li,

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.700
and the other

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.670
will be shared by Su Wuming and me.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.920
Temple keeper,

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.320
we have a guide with us.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.730
Can you find him a place to rest

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.530
in this main hall?

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.880
Certainly.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.410
Lu, you're the leader.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.400
We'll follow your arrangements.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.150
General,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.580
I'll go rest first.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.710
You guys keep drinking.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.120
-Stay a little longer.
-He's at the exciting part of the story.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.920
I'm going. I'm going.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.090
Do you dare to go to sleep alone?

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.820
I'm leaving.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.320
Commander Li,
want to stay and keep listening?

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.290
I have no interest

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.620
in these ghost stories.

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:48.510
Su Wuming.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.120
What about you?

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.120
I'm not tired.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.280
I'll stay a bit longer to read it.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.520
She told me
this is an original from the Western Zhou.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.120
I haven't verified it yet.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.380
I mainly want to hear

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.440
the temple keeper finish the story.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.090
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.530
Hurry.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.730
Keep going.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.390
Keep going.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.920
Alright!

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.560
As I was saying, the lodging girl

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.050
was about to bite the scholar when,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.700
suddenly, looking up,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.290
she noticed that
on the wall in the candlelight,

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.580
there was no shadow of the scholar.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.240
She was terrified.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.940
On this romantic night,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.010
why do you want to leave?

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.900
You don't have a shadow either?

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.320
You're not human?

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.050
Of course I'm not human.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.900
You just realized that now?

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.800
Too late.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.220
The two evil demons in the room

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.730
are actually hiding together?

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.610
Come out and meet your end!

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.050
Just as the two demons

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.530
were at a loss,

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.520
a deafening roar

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.730
rang out,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.620
and an exorcist burst in

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.230
wielding a demon-subduing staff!

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:13.240
Wait.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.630
Roar?

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.650
Is that exorcist also a...

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.620
Do you really think this exorcist

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.810
is really an exorcist?

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.800
Don't keep us guessing.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.110
What kind of creature made that roar?

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.200
A tiger? A lion?

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.800
Yes!

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.220
Well...

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.540
What kind of roar was that?

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.870
It was neither a tiger's roar
nor a lion's.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.510
General,

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.060
did you also hear that roar?

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.130
Yes.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.970
But it's hard to tell
what kind of beast it was.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.070
Could it be Bai Ze?

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.980
Wei, you really believe there's a Bai Ze?

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.230
Of course I do.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.080
Otherwise,

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.040
why would His Majesty order us

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.900
to search for it in the mountains?

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.440
General.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.980
Judging by the sound, it shouldn't be far.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.410
I wish to join you in the search.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.890
If we find Bai Ze,

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.370
when the rewards are given...

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.680
General,

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.900
could you include me?

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:36.930
Official Wei,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.880
it rained heavily earlier,

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.250
and the mountain path is muddy.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.630
Please go back and rest first.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.560
We can search for Bai Ze

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.290
first thing tomorrow morning.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:58.600
Don't panic.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.330
It's not unusual
to encounter wild beasts in the mountains.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.130
If the scholar and the lady

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.360
in my folk storytelling appear,

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.680
that would be truly unusual.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.130
That's true.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.220
Who is the temple keeper?

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.740
My wife and I

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.160
would like to stay for the night.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.800
Wait.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.170
Are you

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:42.960
humans?

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.410
Of course we are.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.600
I'm a scholar.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.360
My surname is Shi,

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.200
and this is my wife.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.800
I have a name.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.720
My wife

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.110
is called Jiao.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.020
Why are you here in the mountains?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.900
Why are you here in the mountains?

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.130
You didn't also take the wrong path

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.060
like us, did you?

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.410
We were

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.480
on our way to Chang'an.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.540
To take a shortcut,

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.010
we accidentally entered the mountain.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.080
Then came the heavy rain.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.290
We're in quite a mess.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.890
[Scholar Shi] [Jiao]

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:11.800
We even heard the roar

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.130
of a wild beast earlier—

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.970
it nearly scared us to death.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:15.810
Luckily,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.350
we found this temple.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.380
So you're here to stay the night?

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.260
Do you recognize this statue?

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.600
Isn't that Deity Bai Ze?

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.860
We worship his statue at our home too.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.960
It's the best
for warding off evil spirits.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.710
Honey,

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.600
let's go pay our respects.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.760
Of course, Honey.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.440
More visitors?

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.880
They're quite devout.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.640
Hurry up.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.250
If you're not buying,

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.590
don't waste my time.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.750
I'll sell it to that couple for 90 cash.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.790
Commander Li,
why haven't you gone to sleep?

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.440
Did you hear

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.640
the beast's roar too?

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.650
I want to avenge Huo Jing.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.770
Official Lu,
are you sharing the east wing with me

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.900
to protect me,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.770
or to keep watch on me

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.130
so I won't go out

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.860
to kill that scoundrel Huo You?

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.080
It is said that Huo You
pushed Huo Jing off the cliff,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.540
but no one actually saw it.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.410
Besides,

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.500
we entered the mountain
on imperial orders.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.060
Until we return to the capital to report,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.000
please be patient,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.100
I am the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.130
and the incident happened
within my jurisdiction.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.350
Once we return to the capital to report,

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.440
I'll see this case

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.610
through to the end.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.690
If it was truly Huo You who did it,

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.380
I will show no mercy.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.140
Do you think I would believe you?

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.960
You're all Imperial Guards,

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.790
birds of a feather.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.240
The two sides fought fiercely.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.830
In the end, the two demons joined forces,

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.450
threw the exorcist

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.510
onto a stone slab,

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.110
and stomped hard on his spine

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.670
until it broke.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.350
Then the two demons
looked at each other, smiled,

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.740
and walked away

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.400
hand in hand.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:57.250
Wait.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.630
Didn't you just say

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:00.840
this exorcist

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.970
was no ordinary exorcist?

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.720
How did he die so quickly?

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.440
Exactly.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.750
I thought he would be more formidable.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.690
Why did they break his spine?

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.200
Yes.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:16.620
This method

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.950
was indeed strange.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.050
Well...

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.990
Could these two demons

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.160
be the legendary weight-bearing ghosts?

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.280
You even know about weight-bearing ghosts?

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.280
I know a little.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.040
Legend has it,

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.650
if a weight-bearing ghost

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.410
wants to return to the human world,

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.640
it must find a replacement

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.000
and kill them.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.200
If the person being killed

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.030
dies sitting up,

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.210
3000 years later,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.690
they can find

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.170
a new successor.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.300
But those two demons

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.600
broke the exorcist's spine,

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.710
so he must have died lying down.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.290
Anyone who dies lying down

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.290
can never

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.380
choose a successor

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.750
to replace themselves.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.350
That means they can never reincarnate.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.730
Only in this way

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:12.670
can a weight-bearing ghost

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.210
remain in the human world forever.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.820
You got it right.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:17.990
Those two

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.620
are weight-bearing ghosts.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.720
You're quite knowledgeable.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.680
I wouldn't say I'm knowledgeable.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.350
I've just read a few books.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.000
But I can't tell a story

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.820
as entertainingly as you do.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.800
Elder, you've been cultivating here
in Mount Zhongnan

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.400
for many years, haven't you?

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:34.360
Indeed.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.170
Earlier you said

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.130
that if we waited here,

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.970
we could see the Bai Ze.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:42.600
That wasn't a joke, was it?

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.850
Long ago,
the Yellow Emperor brought 100 Bai Zes

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.510
from the shores of the Eastern Sea
to the capital

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.790
and then sent them in all directions.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.600
During the Western Zhou Dynasty,

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.260
Emperor Mu, who loved to travel,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.510
once had four Bai Zes pull a chariot
through Mount Zhongnan.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.890
In truth, he used the journey as an excuse

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.560
to cleanse the mountain of demons.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.240
After his victory,

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.690
he left the four Bai Zes in the mountain

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.750
to permanently suppress

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.650
the demons of Guanzhong.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.970
Are you saying

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.050
there really are Bai Zes in this mountain?

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.600
So-called divine beasts

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.850
are really just ordinary creatures

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.320
that existed in ancient times

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.060
and later became extinct,

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:29.730
like

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.650
phoenix,

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:31.560
Qilin,

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.990
and Bai Ze.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:34.970
There's no need to make a fuss

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.940
when they occasionally appear.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.600
Temple keeper,

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.590
aren't you afraid we'll stay here

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:42.640
and not leave?

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.850
If we don't see Bai Ze,

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.710
how will you explain yourself?

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.210
If you don't see Bai Ze,

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.990
you can

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.030
smash my temple!

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.010
Quite a temper.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:03.660
I'm tired.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.329
I'm going back to sleep.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.470
What about you two?

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:07.000
Let's go.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.460
I'll stay a bit longer to drink.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.280
Huo You.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:21.520
Where did you touch that woman

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.780
who fell off the cliff—

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.599
her face or her butt?

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:26.609
Wait.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:28.770
General, I...

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.550
The Princess's Mansion sent two women.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.680
We thought they were quite something,

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:36.750
but surprisingly,

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.350
one was dealt with so easily.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.070
You'll be credited

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.020
with the greatest merit.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.770
Thank you, General.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.760
You scoundrel, stop!

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.440
Commander Li!

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.400
This is none of your business.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.400
If you interfere,

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:59.890
don't blame me
when my blade shows no mercy!

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.060
We're all acting
under His Majesty's orders.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.130
With me here,

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.730
internal fighting will not be tolerated.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:05.590
His Majesty...

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.380
only sent you.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.070
He has no control over me!

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.400
Ding,

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:22.820
what are you doing?

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.580
This young lady has quite a temper.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.940
If she doesn't vent her anger,

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.200
won't she end up burning herself with it?

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:28.930
Huo You!

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.120
Let's have a friendly match

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:31.840
and see what

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.840
the Commander of the Princess's Guards
is capable of.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.390
Being so gentle with the ladies?

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.270
General Ding.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.500
You agreed to a friendly match,

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:15.970
so why use deadly force?

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.420
Let me avenge Huo Jing!

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.520
See?

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.110
She's the one using deadly force!

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.490
Commander Li,

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.390
a wise person knows when to stop.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.130
You want her to be wise?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.290
Does she deserve it?

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.080
Come on!

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.580
Since the Tanglong era,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:35.970
my blade

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.970
hasn't tasted blood for a long time.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:39.730
Enough!

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.410
I am the leader appointed by His Majesty.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.520
General Ding,
please return to your room and rest.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.600
Fine.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:03.640
Let's go.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.610
You, as a woman,

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.890
instead of getting married,

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.930
insist on being a commander.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.260
There has never been
a female regimental commander before you,

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.120
and there will never be one after!

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:21.270
Otherwise,

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.210
what are we generals for?

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.670
It's all the General's fault!

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.600
Otherwise I would have killed her!

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.360
With Lu Lingfeng protecting her,

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.890
it won't be easy to kill her.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.100
I purposely provoked her earlier.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.410
Next time she strikes,

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.890
we will swarm her

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.240
and cut her down.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.880
We must not let her return to Chang'an.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.680
That's right.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.040
Anyone who obstructs our search
for the auspicious beasts

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.740
must die,

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.750
including the General.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.210
General Ding,

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.160
His Majesty is a wise ruler

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.680
and he will lead the Tang Empire
to a glorious age.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.450
But now that
he has just ascended the throne,

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.530
both the court and common people

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:15.800
are full of gossip.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:17.770
The appearance of an auspicious beast

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.980
is the perfect strategy
to silence thousands of mouths.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.240
We cannot be careless.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.210
But His Majesty has entrusted this matter

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.830
to Yongzhou Prefecture Office,

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.170
with Lu Lingfeng as the leader.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.100
That's because
His Majesty wants to test him.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.240
His Majesty values talent,

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.430
but the more talented the disloyal are,

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.130
the less we can tolerate them.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.460
After all,

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.140
what His Majesty urgently needs now

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.540
are trusted commanders,

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.610
not potential threats.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.900
As for Su Wuming,

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.350
he's one of the Princess's faction.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.090
Doesn't he always

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.480
claim to be Master Di's disciple

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.810
and act so smug about it?

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.470
Then for Master Di's sake,

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.890
let Mount Zhongnan

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.790
be his final resting place.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.740
His Majesty's previous reward

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.100
was meant for the heroes of Tanglong era,

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:01.830
for brothers

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.510
of the Imperial Guard like us.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:04.520
Lu Lingfeng

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:06.590
was once among us.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:08.800
At that time,

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.780
who could've thought that his mother

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.310
was actually the Princess?

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.540
At the very moment
his true lineage was revealed,

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.230
he stood on

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.110
the opposite side of His Majesty.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.790
A pity indeed.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.000
Where is Wei Qi?

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.680
He couldn't be so eager for merit

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.310
that he went alone

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.640
to find Bai Ze, could he?

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.810
How ridiculous.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.550
He actually believes

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.810
the legendary auspicious beasts exist.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.460
Great Deity Bai Ze,

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:45.840
where are you?

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.360
I know you're a divine beast

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.440
who can speak in human language.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.710
I'm here to find you.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.160
I mean no harm.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.070
Just now, I specifically paid respect

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.480
to your statue at your shrine.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.500
I am very sincere.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.630
Would you please show yourself?

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.090
If I am ever granted rank and title,

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:03.740
I promise

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.240
I'll build you a golden statue.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.420
Is that you, Great Deity Bai Ze?

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.680
Darling,

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.360
let's rest early after we finish eating.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.310
Scholar,

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.200
traveling at night

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.530
with such a pretty lady,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.460
aren't you afraid of encountering demons?

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.920
Who says we're not afraid?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.100
I'm terrified, actually.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.140
Then buy a Bai Ze Scroll.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.330
It's the most effective
in warding off evil spirits.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.300
Only 90 cash.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.000
90 cash?

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.850
So expensive?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.510
Expensive?

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.200
Aren't you afraid of
being possessed by evil spirits?

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.400
If you care about me,

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:00.960
buy me one.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:02.790
Darling, I...

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.060
Alright, alright.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.520
Wait a moment.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.050
Give me the book now.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.800
I've already found a buyer.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.400
I haven't finished reading it yet.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.460
You penniless guy,

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.050
don't get my book dirty.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:23.460
You know what?

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.310
This really looks like
an original from the Western Zhou.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:27.850
There are many stories

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.250
I've never seen before.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.780
Looks like?

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.600
It is!

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.720
They offered 90 cash for it.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:34.580
Give it to me.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.450
So you only have this one scroll?

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.240
Just this one.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.560
Then can I read a bit longer?

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.880
Only if you buy it.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:45.320
Alright!

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.590
90.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.070
90 cash counted.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:50.590
Where's the Bai Ze Scroll?

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.200
Bring it to my wife.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.370
Sorry, young scholar.

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:56.650
This old scholar bought it first.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.510
Honey,

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.600
he bought it.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.200
Look.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.570
This isn't my fault.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.160
Honey,

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.270
-There's nothing I can do.
-All because you were dawdling.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.530
Don't be mad, alright?

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.080
Two's company, and three's a crowd.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.660
May I join you two

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.400
for a drink?

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.030
Sir,

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.640
I...

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.830
I was just thinking
this water's too bland.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.100
Is that good wine

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:20.440
in your flask?

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.960
Yes, it is.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.590
Sir,

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.580
have a seat.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.370
Absolutely good wine.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.070
I promise one sip

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.810
will make you want 10 more.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.350
I wonder how many sips

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.530
that "10" really means.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.310
As many

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.550
as you say.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:39.960
Anyway,

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.920
it's up to you.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.160
Sir,

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.200
here.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.830
You'd better not drink.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:47.720
If you pass out later,

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.680
who could carry you?

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.140
Why won't you let me drink?

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.030
It's such good wine.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:51.890
I must drink it.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.270
Come, sir.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.590
A toast to you.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.160
Counted.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.070
90 cash.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:07.550
Here.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:09.400
Sir,

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.820
it's good wine.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960
Really good wine.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.920
Here.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.440
Here.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:14.610
Thank you, sir.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.090
It's fate that

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.070
in this remote temple
on a desolate mountain,

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.670
we get to drink such fine wine

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.450
and meet such a good person.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.000
Here.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.310
Let me fill your cup.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:28.420
Well,

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.640
thank you.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:34.480
Miss,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:35.550
please.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.940
-Please.
-Please.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.320
Good wine.

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.150
Good wine.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:02.310
Don't close the door.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.350
You're right.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.200
On the way here,
Huo Jing fell off a cliff.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:10.810
Now,

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.560
this wild temple is mysterious

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.360
and the visitors are strange.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.640
If I hadn't spent 90 cash

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.060
on this Bai Ze Scroll,

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.880
I wouldn't dare to sleep.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.130
She fell asleep?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.730
I don't know.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.920
After a fierce battle earlier,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.440
she hasn't left her room since.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.680
A fierce battle?

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.720
With whom?

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:35.990
The Imperial Guards?

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.380
But I didn't hear a thing

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.290
in the main hall.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.910
But I heard that monster's cry

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.020
very clearly.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.510
Why is it so quiet in her room?

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.750
Commander Li
didn't escape through a window

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:54.720
to fight that Huo You,

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.620
did she?

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.760
I checked that room.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.980
There's no window.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:00.490
The only entrance

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.440
is this door.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.340
No wonder
you arranged the lodging this way.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.170
How thoughtful.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.590
With your protection,

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.690
Commander Li is definitely safe.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.270
However...

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:14.750
Chen He's purse

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.510
[Bai Ze Scroll]

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:17.680
might not be so safe.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.610
What do you mean?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.510
I told you not to drink so much,
but you did anyway.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.030
He hasn't bathed for half a month.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.350
He smells awful.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:33.790
Let's continue drinking.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.590
I just took a bath
before entering the mountain.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.310
Smell it.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:42.480
You're...

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:43.660
too bold.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.280
It's not my fault
your man can't hold his liquor.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.440
What if he's just pretending?

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.030
How could that be?

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.880
Does he enjoy watching you

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:53.640
getting teased by another man?

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:55.880
Who knows?

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.810
A man's heart

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.760
is like the fog in the mountains—

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.190
who can see through it?

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.480
That's because
you're not looking carefully enough.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.270
Later,

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.560
I'll let you take a good look.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:12.790
You're really...

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.470
outrageously bold.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.710
Your voice isn't exactly quiet either.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.930
Aren't you afraid of waking him up?

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.000
A demon!

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.270
Where?

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.500
Right there just now.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.730
It had horns

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.640
and fangs.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:36.920
I think

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.030
you're talking about
the statue of Deity Bai Ze.

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:40.760
If there's a demon in this room,

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:41.920
it's you—

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.030
the little temptress
daring to seduce someone

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:46.100
under a god's nose.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.680
Maybe

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.450
I really was seeing things.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.430
You weren't seeing things—

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.680
you were...

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.130
lovestruck.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.240
My apologies.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.210
Wait for me.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.220
You're even more eager than I am.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:37.960
I'm just afraid

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.310
you'll rush into my arms

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:43.640
and tear my clothes.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.780
That's exactly what I like about you.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.170
Where are you two going?

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:08.300
Traveling at night?

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.240
The road's slippery after the rain.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.890
Aren't you afraid of running into ghosts?

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:12.890
Where we're going

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.570
is none of your business!

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.790
You're quite skilled

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:21.720
at pretending to be drunk—

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.470
waiting till your wife's
carried off by another man

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:24.690
before waking up.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.350
What did you say?

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:28.730
You shameless woman!

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:30.440
You let another man carry you?

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.700
I-I was drunk.

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.070
I didn't know a thing.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.110
Honey,

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.790
some other man was taking advantage of me.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.250
You have to stand up for me.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.060
Speak! Which man carried you?

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.680
Tell me!

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.660
I was drunk.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.360
I don't remember anything.

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:00.600
What's going on?

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.830
Search him

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:02.880
and see if he has

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.210
Official Chen's purse.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:09.080
General.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.610
Where is Chen He?

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.850
You pair of thieves!

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:26.590
Tell me!

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.920
Where did you take Official Chen?

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:28.440
Huo You.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.510
Speak up!

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.650
Isn't he sleeping in bed?

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.090
That's exactly what I like about you.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:52.160
He's down?

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.690
I've never once failed

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.870
when using a knockout drug.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:58.780
He's an official.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.090
He must have money.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.730
Let's go.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.070
What's

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.160
all this noise?

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.200
What's...

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.480
all this noise?

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:53.570
[Bai Ze Temple]

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.370
I guess

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.990
Chen He

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.290
must have acted foolishly while drunk

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.590
and fell into those thieves' trap.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.420
Too embarrassed to face us,

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.480
he just left first.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:07.830
That's possible.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.760
Good morning, General Ding.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.360
Good morning, Official Huo.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.380
Where is Official Wei?

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.310
Mind your own business!

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:21.030
What?

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.960
Don't tell me Wei Qi also...

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.400
You...

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:27.250
Ding,

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.760
where is Wei Qi?

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.679
He disappeared last night.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.239
He must have been eager to earn merit

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:34.100
and went to find Bai Ze overnight.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:37.230
So, Ding,

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.420
what's the plan for today?

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:40.670
You're the leader.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.650
We'll follow your orders.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.320
Didn't Hermit Baize

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.260
say yesterday

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.100
that as long as we waited here,

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.630
Bai Ze would appear?

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.150
The temple keeper's old, half-blind,

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:53.280
and talks nonsense.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:54.710
You actually believe him?

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.190
Of course not.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.040
Good morning, Commander Li.

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:06.130
Did you sleep well?

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.630
Yes.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.000
Well then,

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.990
let's set out to find Bai Ze.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.660
Wait a moment.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.090
Something's not right.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:15.760
Well...

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.590
Where's our guide, Ling Ji?

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:18.760
Why isn't he up yet?

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.280
You mean...

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:30.000
that hunter?

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:33.440
The storehouse next to the kitchen.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.500
That house is tall.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.060
He said he liked it,

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.590
so he slept there.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.110
Ling Ji.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.100
How can you
still be sleeping at this hour?

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.360
Ling Ji!

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.230
Well?

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.920
He hanged himself.

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:47.840
Do you even know how to examine a corpse?

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.500
He was our guide for this trip.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:51.670
If we really find the divine beast Bai Ze,

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.500
he will be set for life

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:54.670
with riches and pleasure.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.130
Why would he hang himself?

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.250
Scholar Su is Master Di's disciple

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:02.770
and an expert in autopsies.

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.100
His autopsy results are beyond question.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.400
Huo You.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.210
Lu Lingfeng,

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.210
do me a favor.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.280
Commander Li,

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:23.610
what are you doing?

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.950
Lift Ling Ji's body onto my back.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.760
I want to bury him.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.780
Do you know him?

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:36.760
Do I

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.680
have to know him to bury him?

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:42.110
Should we just leave his body
to rot in the wild?

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:42.970
Think about it—

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.650
if Ling Ji hadn't taken this job
as our guide,

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.230
how could he have met
such a tragic incident?

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.710
Wait.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.630
Incident?

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:54.110
Commander Li,

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.930
my examination concluded it was

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.090
suicide by hanging.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:00.390
I'm not deaf.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.380
He may have ended his life himself,

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.920
but if he hadn't joined
this absurd expedition,

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.510
I believe

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:09.970
he wouldn't have died.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:14.840
Lu Lingfeng.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.510
Help me.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.740
[Tomb of Ling Ji]

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.260
[Tomb of Ling Ji]

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:15.920
It's General Ding!

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:08.290
Isn't...

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.880
Isn't this Wei Qi, Official Wei?

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.630
Do I need you to tell me that?

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.360
You think I wouldn't recognize

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.060
my brother?

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.590
Silence, all of you!
