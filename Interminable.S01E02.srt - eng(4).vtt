[Previously]
Khun Phra Nai had this white house built…

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.880
in hopes of living with his lover here.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.720
You finally came back to me.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.680
My dear Chuichai.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.040
I feel strangely familiar with this place, Mum.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.280
As if it were a home I had left for so long.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.600
We used to have a great time here together in the past.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.760
I thought I’d never get to see you today.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.760
Where have you been?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.920
I went to Kaew’s house.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.640
That’s her best friend. His name is Kaewta.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.920
You’ve finally returned.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.880
Try to make merits whenever you can.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.160
When the time is right, you’ll finally see that person you wish to see.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.440
Hey!

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.640
You!

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.720

[2490 B.E.]

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.000
You can see me, dear?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.200
No, you can’t.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.560
Where did he go?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.240
When the time comes, you will finally see me.

Mum.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.120
Are you done giving alms to the monks?

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.880
Yes, Mum.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.000
I also dedicated merits to Khun Phra Nai, the owner of this house,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.200
and to all the spirits here too.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.680
Amen.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.600
Let us also rejoice in your merit…

and be thankful to you on behalf of all the spirits here.

Amen.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.880
That’s right, Mum.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.080
Have you seen anyone walking this way earlier?

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.440
Who is it?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.720
I don’t know too.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.000
He’s a man in a white suit.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.440
I didn’t see anyone.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.320
That’s strange. I was walking right after him but then he suddenly disappeared.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.120
I’ll go get you something to eat then, okay?

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.520
Yes.

Saen.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.000
Are you sure this is where my dear Chuichai lives?

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.440
Aww, is she “your dear Chuichai” now, my lord?

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.600
Of course, I am sure.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.040
I already asked the servants at *Luang Sanor’s house. (*Head of Classical Thai Orchestra Bureau)

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.680
They said the lady who performed the Chuichai dance that day…

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.520
Her name is Payom.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.080
Is anybody home?

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.240
Who are you here for?

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.040
My name is Saen, Miss.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.680
And this is my brother, Khun Yai.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.880
Hello, Miss.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.960
Yes.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.200
Why are you here then?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.840
We’re looking for Lady Chuichai who performed the dance at the party…

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.799
at His Royal Highness Prince’s palace the other day.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.120
The one called Payom, Miss.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.080
Oh, I’m afraid that’s me then.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.040
Your name is Payom?

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.320
So? Why do you want to see me?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.480
Those servants at Luang Sanor really told me it’s Payom.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.840
How reckless. We could’ve been killed if that were a thief’s lair.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.240
Then we should just arrest them and send them to the police.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.880
Thief! Catch him!

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.320
There’s a thief, Khun Yai.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.600
Move! Out of the way!

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.120
Hey! Stop!

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.400
Only within an arm reach but feels so far away.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.080
Although he can’t see you yet,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.120
his heart still remembers you, Khun Yai.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.000
But when, Saen? When will Kaew notice me?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.720
That day will certainly come.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.840
Do you still remember what the Abbot said?

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.920
Souls that are bonded…

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.400
cannot stay parted forever.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.880
That’s right but…

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.240
Everything happens in its own time.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.080
When that day comes, I shall never let him go ever again.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.320
May that day arrive soon.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.600
Kaewta.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.160
That’s Ruedee’s best friend.

His name is Kaewta.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.000
Kaewta?

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.520
Be careful, dear.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.400
Sister.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.080
Does it hurt a lot, dear?

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.200
Kaewta!

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.720
Why was I so furious?

Miss Sophee.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.360
Miss Nid and Miss Ruedee are here to see you. Would you like them to come up now?

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.760
Let them in.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.880
Yes, ma’am.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.200
Hello, Aunt Nid.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.640
Hello, Sister.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.120
I heard you have a fever, so I’m a bit worried.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.080
How are you feeling, dear?

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.520
Much better now. A few more days and I’ll be as good as new.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.520
Thank you so much for your concern, Aunty.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.680
You shouldn’t have troubled yourself coming all the way here.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:26.360
My mother would like to invite you to my brother’s welcome back party.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.160
Is he returning from abroad soon?

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.160
Yes.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.000
How wonderful. I’d absolutely be there.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.880
I also have something for you.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.120
What is it?

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.160
Here, take it.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.040
This hairpin…

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.840
is an inheritance from my cousin Sophee.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.200
It looks so familiar.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.880
Sophee, I think this pin belongs to you, dear.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.640
Is it for me?

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.040
Yes, think of it as a gift to welcome you back.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.800
[2455 B.E.]

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.240
Can you please put it on for me?

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.760
Of course. Come.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.640
Thank you.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.840
You look beautiful with this hairpin on you.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.000
Shall the next life truly exist…

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:55.200
I solemnly vow to remember this love and pain…

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.640
and shall get back at all of them!

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.800
What’s wrong, dear?

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.240
Sister, are you all right? Sister!

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.240
- Sophee!
- Anyone, fetch me an inhaler!

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.960
Sophee just fainted. Quickly!

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.040
An inhaler!

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.360
The moment she touched that hairpin,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.800
she screamed so loud and fainted right in front of me and my mother.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.360
Was it that bad?

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.520
Kaew, I think there’s a ghost trapped in that pin.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.080
Nonsense, Ruedee.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.520
What kind of ghost will live in such a tiny pin like that?

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.640
You didn’t see what she was like after she became conscious.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.440
Why?

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.920
It was very strange and also…

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.440
very scary.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.760
Mother, she already came to.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.360
Sister.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.400
Sister.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.400
Nid.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.480
Yes.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.680
How are you feeling, Sister?

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.160
I’m fine!

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.720
Are you sure, dear? You screamed so loud everyone here got frightened.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.200
Then you fainted.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.800
It was just a bad dream.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.480
When she looked at me,

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.440
I felt so creepy and had goosebumps all over.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.640
You know how I usually don’t like her and am quite scared of her.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.600
But now, it’s even worse.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:51.280
As if I might be dead if I spent just a minute longer in her presence.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.400
You’re overthinking, Ruedee.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.800
She’s your sister somehow.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.280
She might be just a cousin, but you two are still related so I don't think she'd hurt you.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.440
I don’t know. But I’m scared.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.840
Sophee.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.840
This pin is proof that I was the first one he loved.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.760
You look beautiful with this hairpin on you.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.920
I still remember how you used to practise making garlands for the monks.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.120
She grew up so quickly, Father.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.400
Thank you, Yai. You were on a business trip…

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.440
but still didn’t forget to buy me and your sister gifts.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.080
Next time, just buy it for her only.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.760
How could I?

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.600
Since my parents passed away,

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.880
you have always taken good care of me, Father.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.640
These gifts are indeed nothing…

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.120
compared to your kindness in caring and raising me up.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.280
No matter how far…

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.720
or how many lives I must live,

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.760
I will find you, my love.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.960
Kaewta!

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.040
Why are you dressed up today?

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.280
What’s with being so meticulous?

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.000
Kaewta!

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:16.960
Kaewta!

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.640
Kaew.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.120
Mum.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.040
Are you leaving, dear?

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.560
Yes, I’ll probably be home late tonight.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.880
But don’t worry, Ruedee has promised to drop me off.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.480
Just take care of yourself.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.600
Yes. I’m going then.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.360
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.320
Why would he be home late?

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.800
Why do you have to come home late?

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.160
I’m worried.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.600
Where are you going, Kaewta?

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.320
Kaewta, I’m talking to you!

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.040
Kaew!

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.360
Kaewta, are you all right?

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.360
Sin! Saen!

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.400
Come help Kaew!

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.120
Khun Kaew!

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:18.920
Khun Kaew!

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.040
What happened?

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.160
Are you all right?

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.280
I just tripped.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.880
Sin, go get the first-aid kit.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.360
Go!

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.760
Please be careful. Can you get up?

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.280
Yes.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.800
I’m okay, Saen.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.120
Is watching you like this the only thing I can do?

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.120
Do you think you can walk?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.160
Yes.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.560
At least it’s not so swollen.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.640
But you still have to be careful though.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.160
Saen!

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.280
Yes?

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.360
Can you see it?

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.280
See what?

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.560
I can come out of the white house now.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.960
You’re right, Khun Yai!

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.240
Saen,

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.560
who are you talking to?

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.120
Sin! Did you find it?

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.960
Yes, coming!

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.320
Hurry up.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.520
Here you go.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.240
Go tend the wound for him.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.920
Where is it, Khun Kaew?

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.440
It might be because of Kaew or…

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:54.520
perhaps it’s not the white house that traps me inside…

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.080
but rather my own heart.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.120
I’m trapped inside my own heart only to wait for him.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.200
It’s about time, Khun Yai.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.280
It’s time for your spirit to become free from such interminable wait.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.440
There you go. You should be fine soon.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.760
Go get the car then.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.520
To drop Khun Kaew off.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.560
Okay.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.920
Please wait for Sin to get the car first.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.960
It’s really nothing at all.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.120
It’s good that you’re fine.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.200
Listen, why do you have to dress up so meticulously for someone else’s party?

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.360
You’re only a guest, not the host.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.760
Here you go, Khun Kaew.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.240
Thank you, Sin.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.200
My pleasure.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.440
Sin.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.840
Why? Are you getting possessive?

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.800
I was just stating the fact.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.960
Oh, right.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.680
Who are you talking to?

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.320
No one. I wasn’t talking to anyone.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.640
See? There’s no one else here.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.640
I think we’d better hurry or we might be late.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.520
Please.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.440
Wow, are you really not possessive?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.560
Are you talking to me?

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.440
Of course, I’m talking to you.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.560
I mean if you’re going to attend someone else’s party,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.440
it’s important to be very meticulous in what you’ll be wearing…

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.200
in order to show respect to the host.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.320
Is what I’m wearing meticulous?

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.120
Very much.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.440
- Sin.
- Yes?

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.160
Shut up and drive!!

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.680
Yes, sir. Let’s get going, Khun Kaew.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.520
Hello, Uncle and Aunty.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.760
Do you know Ruedee has been waiting for you all morning?

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.680
She’s afraid her bestie might bail on her.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.520
Why would I do that?

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.960
A promise is a promise.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.600
That’s right, my bestie.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.120
Sin.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.640
Yes?

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.880
Thank you for dropping me off.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.000
You’re welcome.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.920
You can go back first.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.880
I can go home myself.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.920
You can’t do that. My da…

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.520
I mean, Saen, he has ordered me to wait for you and take you home after the party.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.240
But…

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.320
It’s all right, Khun Kaew. I can wait.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.840
It’s fine, Kaew.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.280
If Sin wants to wait, then let him.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.280
He will also get to have some eye-opening experience at a party like this.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.040
You don’t have to worry about him, Kaewta.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.920
Okay then.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.920
Let’s go, Kaew.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.160
I have everything ready.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.200
Come, let’s go.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.480
Follow me.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.520
Make yourself comfortable, Sin.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.000
Thank you, sir.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.680
It’s done, ma’am.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.000
Put this hairpin on for me.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.080
It looks very antique. Is it an inheritance from your ancestors, ma’am?

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.600
No, it has always belonged to me from the beginning.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.040
How long has it been since I last put it on?

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.320
Hello, Sophee.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.200
Hello.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.400
Sophee.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.680
Sophee.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.080
Chai

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.120
Yes, Mother?

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.080
Do you remember who this is?

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.000
Sophee?

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.560
Is it really you?

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.240
You’ve grown up to be such a pretty lady.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.480
Your gift, Brother.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.560
Thank you so much.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.480
It’s already been a pleasure to have you at my party.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.760
Now you even came bearing me gift.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.960
I couldn’t be more thankful.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.640
Please don’t be. You’re Aunt Nid’s son,

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.680
my very beloved aunt. We’re considered close cousins.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.920
Aww, how I wish you were my blood sister instead.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.160
Unlike my own sister, she doesn’t have any gift for me.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.120
Ahem!

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.400
Who said I don’t have a gift for you, Brother?

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.200
Hello, Sister.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.840
Both you and Mother just wait and see.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.640
Okay.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.880
Father, please also look forward to what gift I’ll give to my brother.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.320
Yes, my dear.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.720
You reincarnated, Sophee.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.600
Let’s go, Sophee.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.120
Sin.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:10.640
Yes?

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.960
I brought you some snacks. Please have them.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:14.960
Thank you.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.240
How kind.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.240
Oh, it’s good.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.800
Khun Yai.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.480
Sin.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.280
What are you doing here?

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.760
Have you seen Kaewta?

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.760
No, sir.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.200
Go find out where he is.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.960
- Yes.
- Go!

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.400
Brother, this way.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.000
Kaewta!

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.080
Now I know you also reincarnated.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.120
It’s too late.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.199
Khun Kaew.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.360
Shall we go home now?

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.280
What? Do you want me to go home now?

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.600
That’s right. Your performance is done, isn’t it?

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.280
I think we’d better go home then.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.120
But I still haven’t greeted the host.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.280
Also, Ruedee told me earlier that she’d introduce her brother to me.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.600
It’d be quite rude of me to leave now.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:13.480
Sin,

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.160
Just pretend you’re sick or have a headache.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.000
Kaewta is soft-hearted, he’ll definitely go back with you.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.040
Sin, what’s wrong?

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.280
I suddenly have a headache.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.440
Are you okay?

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.960
I don’t think so, Khun Kaew.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.560
Ouch, why suddenly a headache?

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.680
Fine, let’s go home.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.440
Yes.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:40.600
Kaew!

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.960
I see you’ve finished changing.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.880
Why are you loitering here? All the guests are asking about you.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.040
Let’s go.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.320
Wait, Ruedee. Sin is not feeling well.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.880
So, I might have to go home now.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.800
You’re not feeling well?

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.400
Yes.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.640
How fortunate of you. We do have a guest here who’s also a doctor.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.200
I’ll ask my servant to tell the doctor to check on you, Sin.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.680
Let’s go, Kaew.

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.520
Sin!

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.200
My head is bursting. My stomach hurts. What to do?

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.200
I’ll go get the doctor now.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.280
Let’s go, Kaew.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.400
Khun Kaew, wait! Khun Kaew!

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.000
Ouch, my head and stomach hurt. Khun Kaew!

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.200
Sin, you’re so useless.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.880
Oh, come on, Khun Yai.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.000
I’m doing all I can here.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.160
What do you expect me to tell him then?

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.400
Should I just tell him, “Khun Kaew, Khun Yai is glaring at me right now”?

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.240
Should I?

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.480
Brother.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.960
Where have you been, Ruedee?

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.680
I went to fetch this one here.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.600
To introduce him to you.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.840
This is Kaewta, my best friend.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.640
The one who performed the dance earlier.

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.880
Hello, Ruedee’s brother.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.720
Hello.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.360
Hello.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.520
I never thought a guy could look so beautiful dressing up as Chuichai.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.360
Beautiful?

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:44.320
Beautiful? Did you mean Kaewta?

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.560
Yes. I mean, he danced so beautifully.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.800
Thank you.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Why is he smiling?

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.960
Don’t look at Kaew like that.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.680
Kaew is mine!

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.320
Do you know that this best friend of mine…

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.840
can dance so well despite never taking any proper dancing class.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.240
Is that true, Kaew?

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.560
You’re exaggerating, Ruedee.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.080
When I was young, my neighbour was a classical Thai dance teacher.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.960
I just learnt it through observation.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.280
I see.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.280
But I agree with Ruedee that you’re certainly good at it.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:44.040
My dear, it’s time to open the dance floor.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:49.560
I think our guests probably want to start dancing now, son.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.760
But if the host still hasn’t initiated the first dance,

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.320
the guests wouldn’t dare open the floor themselves.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.600
But Father…

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.600
I still don’t have a dance partner.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.640
How about Lady Lek, dear?

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.880
Son, but I think Lady La-ong Dao,

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.960
the daughter of Lord Anirut, would suit you more.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.680
I think Lady Lek is a perfect match for you, dear.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.120
But Lady La-ong Dao holds a higher status, honey.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.440
But Lady Lek is prettier.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.160
But Lady La-ong Dao is the daughter of Lord Anirut, honey.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.120
Father. Mother. Please stop.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.760
Is this a welcome back party…

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.560
or a matchmaking party?

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.760
Who will you choose then?

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.320
Who?

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.600
I think I’ve found my dance partner.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.400
Don’t tell me…

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.560
Could you please dance with me, Kaew? Please help me.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.800
- Sin!
- Yes?

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.320
You have to help me.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.440
What is it?

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.400
Are you sure?

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:58.120
I’m going to dance with Kaewta tonight.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.640
What do you mean? This is not a charade, son.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.320
I agree, honey.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:13.560
How can two men dance together?

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:18.600
But Father, if I decide to pick one of the girls here tonight,

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.480
the others might feel humiliated.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.480
I agree with him.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.600
Then, why don’t you just pick Ruedee…

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.320
or your cousin, Sophee, instead?

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:36.120
Father, if he chooses to dance with his own sister,

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.400
wouldn’t all the girls here be disappointed?

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.280
They might think none of them is good enough for him.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.160
Yes, Rueduee is absolutely right.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.440
I often saw men dance together back when I was still abroad.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.640
Kaew.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.360
Please dance with me.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.720
Please, Kaew.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:21.640
None of us here can help him right now except you.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.240
Please help him.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.680
Please help me, Kaew.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.040
Please.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.720
It’s time to go home, Kaewta.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.480
You!

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.360
Sin, is there something wrong?

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.160
Sin?

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.560
Sin, what’s wrong?

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.640
It’s time to go home, Kaewta.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.560
My apologies to everyone.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.760
Let’s go, Kaewta.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.600
Kaew!

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.560
Wait, Kaew!

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.200
What’s going on here?

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.480
Wait.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.840
Dragging me out like this is very rude of you.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.160
I’m saving you from an awkward situation.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.720
Why? Or do you want to dance with that brat?

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.800
Why do you have to be angry, Sin?

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.640
It’s not like I want to dance with Ruedee’s brother.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.480
And what’s wrong with you?

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.520
Why are you gripping so hard?

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.440
Let’s just go home.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.440
Ouch!

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:23.720
Sin.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.120
Sin!

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.280
Sin! What’s wrong?

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.360
Sin!

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.160
Sin, can you hear me?

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.080
Sin!

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.480
Sin, can you hear me?

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.680
You.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:56.640
Sin.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.560
You fainted earlier. Did you know that?

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.160
And I saw someone here too.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.520
He walked that way and just disappeared.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.440
Oh, dear.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.120
What is it?

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.560
Let’s hurry home, Khun Kaew.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:27.880
Saen!

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.400
Saen!

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.480
Saen!

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.280
Geez, what’s with the ruckus?

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.520
Don't ask now, Come here.

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:35.520
What?

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.720
We have a problem.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:37.760
What is it?

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.600
What’s going on, dear?

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.160
I don’t know too, Mum.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.640
Why didn’t you stop him then?

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:54.240
How could I? You know what he’s like when he’s mad.

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:56.760
Where’s he now?

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.400
Please excuse us.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.960
Saen, wait for me.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.000
Saen!

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.360
Khun Yai.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.120
Khun Yai.

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.120
Saen.

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:33.920
Khun Yai!

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.080
[Next Episode]
I can feel there’s someone else living in this house.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.040
It’s just us here.

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.720
Why does that man look so much alike the one in my dream?

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.920
Why is he behaving suspiciously?

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.760
There must be something in there.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.720
Khun Kaew!

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.760
What are you doing here?

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.280
Sin is always sleeping here to guard this room.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.880
What’s in there?

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:06.440
Why is there a forbidden area for the house owner?

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.280
Who are you? How did you get in here?

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:10.920
Well…

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.520
Why do you want to see me?

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.080
My cousin, Sophee, wants you to draw her portrait.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.720
The white house…

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.480
Have you seen Khun Yai yet?

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.240
Actually, I have seen him.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:41.040
-You've seen him but you're not sure?
-Yes, because it was so quick and sudden.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:46.120
-Not clearly.
-Not yet. I haven't seen enough.

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.600
What did you do in the previous scene?

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.920
The previous scene was offering food to monks
in front of the house.

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:53.560
After offering food,
I poured the water over the flowers for the merit.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.920
The spirits in the house are fulfilled!

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.120
Everyone said "Amen," almost giving it away.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.480
We would like to rejoice in the merit.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.720
And thank you on behalf of all the spirits in this place.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.520
Amen.

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.080
Do you see the ghost behind you?

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.880
[He's gone.]

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.760
[The ghost is gone.]

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.680
The ghost is gone.

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.120
I ate chicken noodles and I'm so full. I ate two bowls.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.040
[Two bowls?]

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.520
I'm so stuffed right now.

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.880
Is anyone here?

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.480
Is anyone here?

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.480
Is anyone here?

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.800
Do you have some business?

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.640
I'm looking for the classical dancer
who performed the Chui Chai dance at the party

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.720
at the event of His Royal Highness, the Prince, the other day.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.800
The one named Payom.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:56.240
Oh, if her name is Payom, that would be me.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.960
Thief! Catch him!

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.400
There’s a thief, Khun Yai.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.680
Move! Out of the way!

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:27.800
[Walk past him, we can't see him.]

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.320
[Where are you dressing up so handsomely to go?]

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.920
Today, I'm going to Ruedee's house party.

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.560
Am I speaking clearly? Rue Dee's house.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.640
I'm angry and irritated now.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.920
He's dressing up too nicely to go out.

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.960
He is already taken.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.960
Of course, I'm jealous, right?

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.160
I'm mad. I close the book and throw it away.

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.240
I don't have much power, so this is all I can do.

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:13.440
All I can do is watch him every day and smile.

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.720
A spirit who spies on his loved one.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.880
Tired, I'm tired.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.040
-It's a long run.
-A lot of running too.

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.840
Combined across all takes, it must be a kilometer.
It's a kilometer for sure.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.920
-Got some cardio.
-Khun Yai ordered Sin to go get the medicine.

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.920
Yeah, the scene where he goes to
get the medicine, he ran a lot!

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.760
-Ran in at first, then ran out again.
-Yes, sir.

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.080
-And then went to get the car.
-Yes.

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.080
Father ordered me to get the car again, oh my.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.400
He's a runner.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:52.040
-The runner.
-The storyteller. Always moving.

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:55.560
-Was the previous scene easy?
-Kaewta is probably the main cause of the story.

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.800
-Yes, Kaewta.
-It was fun.

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:03.480
You don't have to dress up too meticulously for someone else's party.

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.800
You're a guest, not the host.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.560
Mmm-hmm.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.840
-Take a picture for me.
-Why dress so meticulously for someone else's party?

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.720
It's not your own event, understand?

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.960
[Can he compete with you?
I saw you dancing together.]

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.920
Oh, no, no. I concede to Babe.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.400
He is all dressed up today.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.120
-Are you cold?
-Not cold, but not hot.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.160
Not hot?

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.760
-**%^&**
-I can't hear you.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.480
Who killed Araya?

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:10.840
Be careful not to be deceived.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.600
-Payoon...
-Huh?

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.720
...didn't kill her.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:14.680
What about Babe?

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.240
He didn't kill her either.

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:17.680
I like you.
