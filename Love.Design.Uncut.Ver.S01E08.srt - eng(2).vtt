00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.930
So… do you guys know who's the mole yet?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.200
We need to catch them red-handed.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.000
Auntie, you take the hard disk and give it to Thee.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.800
But don’t let him know you’ve been caught.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.370
We won’t take action against you.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.200
Uh… so does that mean we’re throwing away the first design?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.900
No. We’re not throwing it away.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.430
We’re going to use it to bait Mind Space.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.570
As for Khun Parat’s project—

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.900
let’s compete fair and square.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.130
Looks like we finally get to compete for real this time.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.370
You’re competing with me, too.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.070
Hello.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.070
I’m Mind, from Mind Space.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.870
We can’t deny that in this era…

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.070
technology is becoming more and more a part of our daily lives.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.430
It’s practically a part of us now, and it’s clear that…

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.800
our world — and the way we live — is about to change.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.470
Which brings us to today’s concept —

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.400
Smart Hotel.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500
A hotel that brings together technologies of the future…

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.600
to provide the highest level of convenience for every guest.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.300
Sis.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.700
She's not using the design that they take from us.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.600
But it still maintains the distinctiveness—

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.400
—the luxury and perfection—

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.000
—that define The Eraside.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.970
In an age where privacy matters most,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.900
The Eraside will minimize the use of staff—

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.070
—while still catering to every guest’s needs, twenty-four hours a day.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.900
To deliver true comfort and happiness for every guest.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.100
So that they’ll experience absolute ease—

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.400
—especially the new generation, our guests of tomorrow.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.370
Why didn’t you use the design I gave you?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.300
I’m just doing what’s right—

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.670
—and what’s best for our company.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.970
Mind.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.970
So… what do you think of her work?

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.100
Honestly, I’m glad she showed her own skills.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.670
But after seeing it—

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.670
I have to admit… she’s really talented.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.500
You’re amazing, and so am I.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.900
Our whole team is amazing—

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.630
everyone’s giving their all on this project.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.030
And I believe it’s going to turn out great.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.570
Come here— energy recharge!

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.700
Be confident.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.200
Thanks.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.370
Anytime.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.100
Honestly… I’m nervous.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.470
Charging up!

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.270
You got this.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.500
It’s like…

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.300
a five-star buff.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.270
I thought you were—

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.700
—casting a spell or something.

Hello, I’m Aokbab from Jinta Architects.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.970
I’m Rin.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.400
When we talk about the hotel of the future—

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.300
what’s the first thing that comes to mind?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.400
Modernity? Futuristic innovation?

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.130
Or perhaps something entirely new?

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.130
The word future can be interpreted—

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.470
—in endless ways, right?

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.570
Today, Jinta Architects—

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.900
—will present a new vision of the hotel of the future.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.570
Our concept is—

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.730
“Anything Is Possible.”

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.400
At The Eraside, anything is possible.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Through our research—

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.430
studying customer needs and feedback,

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.870
both from existing guests and new potential customers,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.700
we found that a five-star hotel doesn’t just mean—

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.100
rankings of luxury,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.570
or having complete facilities.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.970
It means—

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.870
five stars in the hearts of our guests.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.800
With air pollution this bad, how do we even get rid of it?

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.000
We can’t. Not while humans are still here.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.430
Huh?

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.100
Since humans created this problem—

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.170
and can’t undo it—

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.500
we let nature do the cleanup.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.970
Rebuilding

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.800
Restoring the planet.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.370
Our first star—

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.600
Green spaces and clean, breathable air.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.070
Thailand is currently facing serious air-pollution issues.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.770
Guests who stay at a hotel—

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.670
besides wanting to relax,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.370
to escape the chaos—

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.200
they also long for soothing, refreshing nature.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.670
and clean, pollution-free air.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.370
We aim to design the space with as much greenery as possible.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.200
Using large trees to reduce heat and dust.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.870
To provide cleaner and fresher air for our guests.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.100
We will also design the building to—

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.800
—utilize renewable energy,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.000
reducing energy consumption

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.200
by applying natural mechanisms such as—

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.700
wind direction and natural lighting.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.130
Our second star—

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.770
Comfort and exceptional service.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.670
At The Eraside, convenience begins—

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.100
from the moment our guests walk through the door.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.300
Every room’s interior—

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.670
beautifully designed and fully functional—

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.670
truly meets guests’ needs.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.070
ensuring the highest level of comfort.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.800
Our third star—

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.330
health, happiness—what we define as—

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.870
Happy Wellness.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.770
A life of wellbeing and genuine happiness.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.500
We’ve designed a full healthcare center—

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.430
within the hotel zone, ready to support guests’ health—

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.000
and address any medical needs they may have.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.830
But wellness here doesn’t only mean physical health—

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.570
we also focus on lifestyle design—

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:53.170
that supports both emotional and physical wellbeing.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.570
The fourth star — value.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.770
Guests expect satisfaction equal to —

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.400
or greater than what they pay.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.500
But value means different things to different people.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.730
Which brings us to the final star — the heart of our hotel.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.870
The experience itself.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.300
That’s why we designed the new Eraside —

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.730
to deliver experiences that feel fresh,

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.870
meaningful, comfortable, and exceptionally serviced.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.500
Something no other hotel has offered before.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.900
Every room is uniquely designed —

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.200
to match each guest’s lifestyle and personal taste.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.800
We want a five-star hotel to be accessible to all ages and groups —

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.470
because everyone is an important guest.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.900
We believe that listening to guests —

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.900
and designing with empathy and heart —

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.530
is what allows —

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.200
“Anything is possible” at The Eraside.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.900
The hotel of the future — for everyone.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.600
After discussing with all the judges,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.100
there were two projects whose votes —

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:54.470
truly stood out —

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.670
among the panel.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.100
They are —

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.470
Mind Space.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.500
And —

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.470
Jinta Architect.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.000
As the owner of The Eraside,

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.000
I will cast —

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.500
the final deciding vote for the winner.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.470
Jinta Architect.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.300
Mind Space.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.870
Both companies delivered designs that —

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.570
clearly represent the hotel of the future,

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.770
with a distinct identity that feels complete.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:48.200
The Mind Space team —

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.930
created a concept that fits perfectly with the modern era of hospitality,

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.870
integrating advanced and forward-thinking technology.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.970
But what I personally like the most —

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.400
is how they captured the luxury of —

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.600
The Eraside in such an exceptional way.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.470
As for Jinta Architect,

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.000
they delivered something truly distinct —

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.670
a vision we never expected The Eraside could become.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.900
But it is filled with sincerity,

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.300
something they genuinely want to give every guest.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.600
This kind of design lets us clearly see the future —

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.970
the direction The Eraside will take moving forward.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.770
And because of this —

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.830
I want to choose the best hotel concept for —

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.370
my guests.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.070
And while the hotel proposed by —

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.700
Mind Space may be lacking in one area…

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.970
Technology —

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.470
may not always meet the needs of every age group.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.530
I firmly believe that in the hotel business —

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.970
the heart of hospitality still matters the most.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.870
And service is the element I value above anything else.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.730
Therefore, my final decision goes to —

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.770
Jinta Architect!
Woo!

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.170
Thank you very much

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.470
Congratulations.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.870
Due to an unexpected incident…

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.030
The Eraside would like to…

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.470
take some time to verify the facts, and postpone the contract signing with the winner.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.200
- Hey
- Hey, what's going on!?

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.700
What?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.830
What happened?

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.600
What's going on?

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.800
They’re guessing the people in the leak…

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.170
…are Khun Aokbab, and Khun Mind.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.030
Who the hell spread this nonsense?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
It’s that page again.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.800
They always post gossip to attack and discredit other companies.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.170
Before this…

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.930
they’ve already caused trouble for so many companies.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.570
I wasn’t the one who did this, Aokbab.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.770
The thing I regret most in my life…

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.070
is knowing someone like you.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.100
Khun Prim…

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.200
Have you seen this news?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Oh god…

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.430
Slandering people like this…

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.270
If you want to take legal action…

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.700
…you can.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.100
I’m really worried about Rin.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.000
I keep calling but she won’t pick up.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.430
Wanna go see her? I can drive for you.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.100
I think I'll pass.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.070
It’s not like I can help anyway.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.600
I’ll just send her some desserts instead.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.000
Good idea. Maybe some food support will help her de-stress.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:39.870
Okay.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.070
—Want me to help?
—Sure.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.200
That rumor page…

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.470
That was you, wasn’t it?

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.400
How would you know?

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.000
Because you’re always discrediting other companies.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.400
If you’re still gonna lie…

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.770
Want me to check your computer?

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.900
Why are you making a big deal out of this?

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.870
Our company isn’t losing anything.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.630
And no one knows it’s my page anyway.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.230
It’s not just about the company!

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.000
My name is in the middle of all this.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.300
I don’t want people digging up this stuff.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.670
If you want to survive…

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.700
you do whatever it takes, right?

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.900
If you’re gonna kill a snake—finish th...

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.170
Stop it, P’Thee.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.700
I told you this since the day we started this company.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.000
This is how the designing industry works.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.630
And you were the one who told me—

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.800
that you wanted to be successful.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.930
Wanted recognition.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.370
Well, now you have it.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.770
Success comes with a price, doesn’t it?

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.900
I must have made the wrong decision.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.230
I’m resigning.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.600
Resign?

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.700
Someone like you…

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.070
You don’t have the nerves to walk away from everything you built.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.370
Don’t let me find out who owns that shitty page.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.500
Do you have any proof—

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.000
That the design really belongs to you?

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.370
I don’t.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.230
Even if I got the drawing back from P’Mind—

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.100
it still wouldn’t count as proof that I drew it.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.200
Everyone—

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.230
Guys,

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.200
Look at this.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.170
Khun Thee.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.200
What?

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.670
Are you quitting following your senior?

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:40.470
I’m not letting you resign.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.370
I don’t like the way you run things, Khun Thee.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.400
What did you say?

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.400
From the rumors that have been spreading—

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.300
today, I want to tell everyone the truth.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.100
Ten years ago…

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.000
Khun Aokbab and I really did have an issue.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.200
Just like everyone suspected.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.170
Today, Mind would like to tell everyone the truth.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.330
Ten years ago…

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.070
What’s going on?

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.570
I don’t know.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.870
But the person who stole the work…

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.370
wasn’t Khun Aokbab.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:45.970
It was me.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.270
I used Khun Aokbab’s design and submitted it to the competition.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:03.200
And that architect gossip page that leaked the news…

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:07.670
was actually Khun Thee’s doing.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.470
Khun Thee owns those pages.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.700
He uses them to spread rumors and destroy his competitors’ reputations.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.500
Out of the way! Out of the way!

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.600
Mind! Open the door! Mind! Mind!

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.600
What the hell is wrong with you, Mind?!

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.500
I told you to open the damn door!

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.770
Where’s the key? Go get it! Now!

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:30.970
Open it!!

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.100
And besides that—

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.770
Khun Thee has been using dirty tricks to sabotage and steal other companies’ work.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.700
Taking their designs and claiming them as his own.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.400
I have all the evidence—

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.770
enough to incriminate Khun Thee completely.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.000
After this live ends—

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.870
I will send everything to the reporters immediately.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.100
Mind!

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.970
Damn it, Mind!

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.300
Mind!!

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.400
I know that what I’m doing right now—

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.270
…can’t undo the terrible things I did in the past.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.370
But I want to finally do the right thing.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.570
And I want to sincerely apologize to Khun Aokbab—from my heart.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.800
Aokbab…

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.470
I’m really sorry.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.600
See? I told you.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.100
I told you before—the truth is the truth.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.870
- Ow!
- What the hell are you doing!? huh?

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.900
I’m just taking responsibility for what I did.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.830
Whatever happens to you… that’s on you.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:58.700
- Mind, you little—
- Let go!

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.800
- Khun Thee—
- What?

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.070
The Board of Directors needs you in the meeting room immediately.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.930
Everyone is waiting for you, sir.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.930
You're removing me from this company?

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.770
I'm afraid that's the only decision.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.100
You're believing the nonsense from that employee—

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.430
who went live just now?

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.730
I built this company.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.900
You have no right to throw me out.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.070
Before Khun Mind went live,

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.400
she sent me copies of the documents.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.400
I reviewed them myself.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.970
I truly didn't expect…

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.000
that someone like you…

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.370
would dare do something so unethical in your own profession.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.670
All for the sake of the company’s reputation.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.970
Mind Space is no longer yours.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.400
You're believing that lunatic?

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.700
There’s no proof behind anything she said!

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.500
Someone left a letter for you, Khun Thee.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.670
It's done, Khun Pad.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.070
Yes, it’s been delivered to Khun Thee.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.470
Oh, it’s nothing. Just a small matter.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.300
If there’s anything else, just let me know — I’ll handle it for you.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.030
Yes, yes. Okay.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.100
Yes. Goodbye.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.170
Thank you so much for taking care of this.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.800
My pleasure.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.200
Well then…

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.370
Would you like a cup of coffee? I can make one for you.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:25.900
That sounds great.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.100
Uh… Khun Prim.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.400
Yes?

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.670
Uh… could you teach me…

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.400
…how to make coffee?

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.000
I mean… in case…

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.500
one day I might apply to be…

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.270
…a barista here or something.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:51.770
I’d be happy to.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.470
Okay.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.970
– That’s the coffee handle.
– Yes.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.000
First, we have to take this part out.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.570
Then we grind the beans from here.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:05.400
And then fill it from this side.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.770
Lock it in, then tamp it lightly.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.270
Congratulations.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:45.670
Thank you for trusting Jinta Architect.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.070
We’ll make your hotel the very best we can.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.800
I’m counting on you.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:59.470
Yay!
Yay!

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.470
Oh right—everyone, I forgot to tell you.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.500
– I have something important.
– What is it?

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.430
Today…

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.600
we’re not working!

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.400
– I’m taking everyone out to celebrate!
– Woo!

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.270
– Really?
– Yay! Then let’s hurry!

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.800
It would be bad if P’Pad changes his mind!

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:01.570
Congratulations.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.400
For winning Khun Parat’s project.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.030
Aokbab…

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.370
– If I asked for your forgiveness…

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.170
– I forgive you.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.670
It’s all over now.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.770
The past is the past.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.670
Can I keep this one?
I’ll take another photo for you.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.500
You’ve always been my inspiration.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:05.070
I wanted to be an architect as good as you.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.200
And after this…

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.000
what will you do next?

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.400
I’ll probably stay abroad for a while.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.400
To rethink everything.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.530
Then…

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.270
Good luck.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.500
I’m leaving then.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:44.800
Let’s go eat.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.200
A hug… to give you strength.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.700
Giving encouragement… to someone who just lost her job?

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:13.070
Mm-hm.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.070
You’re… not stressed at all?

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:24.400
I don’t have a job anymore, you know.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:27.700
I don’t even know how I’m supposed to take care of you.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.430
It’s okay.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.570
I’ll take care of you instead.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.970
And I believe someone as talented as you…

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.300
anywhere you apply, they’ll accept you.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.970
My P’Vee is super talented already.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.700
Oh—

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.870
So now you might get to work with me, right?

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:51.400
Would Jinta really hiring me?

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.470
They won’t accept me...

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:55.470
But you never know unless we try.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:56.730
Just watch me.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.600
I’ll psycho Khun Aokbab until she hires you.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:01.930
And if she still refuses…

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.370
I’ll threaten to quit.

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.200
That far, huh?

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:07.400
Yup.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.870
I may be tiny—

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.470
but I’m good at everything, you know.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.770
…or am I wrong?

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.900
Finally…

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.070
everything’s over now, Sis.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:41.970
Yeah…

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:43.500
It’s finally over.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.000
Thanks, Rin.

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.700
Thanks for…

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.200
Well…

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.870
thank you for working with me.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.000
That’s it?

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:05.970
[Sigh]

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.370
Thank you for designing love… for me.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.970
Designing love…

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.500
sounds really nice.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.530
Do you love Aokbab (Designing)?

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:45.470
Rin really loves designing.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.900
And…

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.700
do you love this P'Aokbab?

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.370
This P'Aokbab?

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.400
I love you more than anyone in the world.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.170
From now on…

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.800
From now on…

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.800
let’s design our love story together.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.500
- Okay.
- Hurry up!

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:48.170
Bee.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:50.670
- Yess?
- Come here a sec.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:51.800
Just a moment.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:56.830
What is it?

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.100
Let me fix this part, then you can send it to the client.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.000
Okay.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.200
Lip color looks pretty, right?

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.700
Of course

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.500
Whoa— tone it down, please.

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:09.870
My sugar level’s rising.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:11.800
Seriously, I’m gonna puke from the sweetness.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.370
Ugh, way too sweet. Diabetes is coming for me.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:16.870
I can’t. The love in the air stinks too strong.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.000
I’m reporting this to Khun Aokbab.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.900
She should set a rule—no flirting at work.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.200
Hey, no way.
This CEO’s girlfriend does NOT approve.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.400
Why am I the only single one here…

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:30.970
Then hurry up and find someone.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:32.070
Wait— or maybe…

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.900
Oops.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:37.570
That could work.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.900
- Yeah, that works.
- Heyy, what's going on?!

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.670
Huh?

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:41.600
It's alright Yong.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.770
What??

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.170
We are ending up single together.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.700
Are you guys crazy or what?

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.070
Who’s ending up single?

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.500
No way.

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:58.270
What would you like to order?

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.470
Can I order you… to be my girlfriend?

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.600
No.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.100
…don’t know why I even refused.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.370
These days, Khun Prim…

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:48.670
…your jokes are getting so much better.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.370
I learned them from you, Khun Jade.

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:01.370
- The stairs here are pretty sturdy.
- Yes.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.470
I remember you like roses.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.370
Yes, I do.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.470
Do you like these?

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:12.870
I do.

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:13.670
I mean…

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.000
Do you like me too?

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.870
Excuse me, are you Khun Pad from Jinta Architect?

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.400
No problem at all. Please, have a seat.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.300
I’m NhomPang, the one with the appointment.
- Yes.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.370
My house… will the budget be okay?

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.100
Please~ help me out...

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.400
P’Pad…

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.500
Sure, then…

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.100
Let me take a look for you.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:59.500
You’re really beautiful… hmm.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.170
I mean Khun NhomPang

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.670
Let's make it more minimal

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.970
About things like…

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.570
Like the kitchen, um…

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.000
This plan,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.070
The toilet.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.270
Are you alright?

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.670
If it's like this, I'm ok.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.770
Damn it!

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.200
I hope you choke on your coffee and die!

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:31.600
You…

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:32.900
You…

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.570
You…

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:39.770
You…

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.600
I hate you!

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.570
I can hear you, you know.

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:52.800
Sorry.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.170
Thought I was alone.

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:57.370
Your voice is loud enough to reach my tent.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.100
What are you doing here?

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:02.930
What do you expect me to do?

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.470
I’m heartbroken right now.

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:09.870
Heartbroken?

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.430
Yeah.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.270
He brought me here for coffee…

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.100
And then suddenly dumped me right here.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.700
So I came here to curse him to my heart’s content.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:26.900
What's your name?

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.300
Blue.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
I'm Chan.

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:34.500
How about this?

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.970
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.200
When you're done drinking, you stand right here and yell at him again.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:41.970
Shout at him right here.

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.630
I'll stand here and yell with you.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.330
What beans do you use?

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.630
Colombia medium roast.

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:56.970
The taste notes are chocolate and caramel.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.470
Is that okay for you?

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:01.370
Works for me.

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.070
You have a great taste.

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.000
Come on, follow me to my tent.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.670
Here you go.

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.000
You love watching me drawing that much?

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:46.170
I like both —

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.430
I like both you and the drawings you make.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.900
And what are you drawing now?

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:02.600
I’m…

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.500
designing our love.

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:08.170
Hm?

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:11.900
I’m…

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.900
designing our future home…

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.000
the home we’ll live in together in the future.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:23.870
Let me see.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:29.570
Whoa…

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.770
It’s beautiful.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.100
But I think…

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:42.500
I might hire a Master architect to help designing it.

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:46.370
But I’m not sure will she accept this project.

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.700
Why pay someone? Why not do it yourself?

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.070
And how much is her fee, huh?

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:03.770
Money probably isn’t enough… you might need another offer.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.170
And what if…

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.430
I offer both my heart and body?

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.270
Would that be enough?

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.400
If she agrees, we can sign the contract tonight.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.470
Tonight?

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.800
Can we do it right now instead?

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.900
Like—right now.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:33.700
Rin

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.230
I'm gonna fall

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.500
I'm nearly fall!

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:47.400
…That’s cute.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:56.100
Did you know, I'm alittle bigger

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.500
What do you think?

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.200
This is the place.

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:08.500
Nice location.

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.430
Perfect for the house you designed.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.100
The house we designed together.

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.530
I love you, Rin.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.870
I love you too.

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.130
You really called a Feng Shui master?

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:45.600
Well…

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.670
P'Pad insisted it’s a must.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.900
Master, is this area not good?

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.100
The land itself has no problem.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:08.070
This land will bring happiness…

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.000
…and wealth flowing in.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.000
However…

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.630
You cannot build the house right now.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:19.970
Huh? You just said it was good.

00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:25.070
You two must get married first.

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:29.300
If you don’t marry within this year…

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.700
…you’ll definitely break up.

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.600
Get married!?

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.400
You two must get married first.

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:49.900
Get married!?

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:52.200
I want to get married.

00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:54.670
I'm not really into ceremonies.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.200
Listen to me.

00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.170
If two people truly love each other—

00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:59.670
Something this small—

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.100
—won’t make them break up.

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:01.900
…Hopefully.

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.230
My girlfriend—

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:06.470
She doesn’t really seem to want to get married.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.300
Where did you two first meet?

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:09.870
Then start from there.

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:11.270
Whatever makes you happy—

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:13.500
I want to do that for you.

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:37.970
