00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:01.345
Such nice weather.

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:03.345
I only took a short drive from Bangkok.

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:13.025
Don't do that, Jane.

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:15.105
-Do what?
-What you're doing.

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:17.505
You should go put on an apron.

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:24.385
CAN I LOVE YOU?

00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:25.305
It's here.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.385
Come, I'll help you put it on.

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:28.625
You loved me, Jane?

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:32.745
Let's do homework.

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:09.584
If I'm not here one day, who'll tutor you?

00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:12.825
No one.

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:14.705
Oh?

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:17.425
Because you'll never leave me.

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:21.785
How do you know?

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:27.305
Because I won't let you leave.

00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:36.865
And I promise,

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:39.705
no matter what happens,

00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:41.625
I won't leave you either.

00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:48.865
Promise.

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:55.305
What's wrong? Hesitating?

00:02:58.425 --> 00:03:00.465
Your grades are so low.

00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:02.945
What if
we get into different universities?

00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:06.385
Are you bullying me about my grades?

00:03:06.465 --> 00:03:08.345
-Are you a bully?
-No!

00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:10.745
-Lin!
-You wanna fight?

00:03:11.505 --> 00:03:12.545
Take this!

00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:32.105
Promise me that you won't leave me.

00:03:51.025 --> 00:03:54.145
Promise me you won't leave me.

00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:00.985
Or will you?

00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:05.785
Promise me.

00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:08.425
Promise me.

00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:12.505
Please.

00:04:13.105 --> 00:04:14.345
Fine.

00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:16.465
Here.

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:26.065
QUESTION

00:04:26.145 --> 00:04:29.225
ANSWER

00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:32.145
When I came to get the apron,

00:04:32.745 --> 00:04:34.265
I found this shirt.

00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:42.585
That's your shirt, the one
you gave me to sign after graduation.

00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:50.865
Did you ever read what I wrote on it?

00:04:50.945 --> 00:04:53.705
No. I didn't have time.

00:04:54.785 --> 00:04:56.305
That day I rushed to sign yours

00:04:56.945 --> 00:04:58.705
and return it,

00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:02.545
but by the time I got to your house,
you were gone…

00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:05.985
without a word.

00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:12.025
I'm sorry, Jane.

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:18.425
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:24.305
I had so many chances, but…

00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:28.665
I didn't dare.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.425
And you chose to leave
without saying anything.

00:05:38.185 --> 00:05:39.345
Jane,

00:05:41.265 --> 00:05:43.025
It's my fault.

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:48.025
I was afraid if you told me not to go,

00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:51.425
I'd change my mind.

00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:59.825
You're that important to me, Jane.

00:06:01.985 --> 00:06:04.425
No one can replace you.

00:06:07.265 --> 00:06:09.865
You're the best friend I've ever had.

00:06:26.305 --> 00:06:29.025
What if I don't want
to be your best friend?

00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:33.065
Jane…

00:06:36.985 --> 00:06:38.225
You asked

00:06:39.705 --> 00:06:41.625
if I still loved you.

00:06:44.665 --> 00:06:45.945
If I do…

00:06:50.025 --> 00:06:52.265
can you love me?

00:07:54.705 --> 00:07:56.625
I haven't wanted to be just your friend…

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:00.585
for a long time.

00:09:19.265 --> 00:09:20.305
Lin,

00:09:21.465 --> 00:09:23.545
Kate sent so many gifts.

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:25.265
Come look.

00:09:26.865 --> 00:09:29.825
At first, I didn't know who would send

00:09:29.905 --> 00:09:31.225
such a huge box.

00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:33.545
See?

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:36.745
Even when you're apart,
she still sends these things.

00:09:36.825 --> 00:09:37.905
Such a lovely girl.

00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:41.025
It makes me so happy

00:09:41.105 --> 00:09:43.505
seeing Kate look after you.

00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:03.225
What's wrong?

00:10:07.505 --> 00:10:09.345
Why are you crying?

00:10:15.585 --> 00:10:17.305
I broke up with Kate, Mom.

00:10:18.825 --> 00:10:19.865
Why?

00:10:24.225 --> 00:10:25.865
She was with someone else.

00:10:28.305 --> 00:10:29.865
How do you know?

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.425
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:10:41.345 --> 00:10:42.665
She was in bed with a man.

00:10:51.305 --> 00:10:52.785
You know

00:10:53.305 --> 00:10:56.305
how it feels to be betrayed, don't you?

00:11:02.665 --> 00:11:03.505
I know.

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:09.825
And I know I made mistakes too.

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:15.225
I don't want you
to make the same mistakes I did.

00:11:19.185 --> 00:11:20.625
You didn't make mistakes, Mom.

00:11:20.705 --> 00:11:21.785
Yes, I did.

00:11:22.385 --> 00:11:24.825
I walked out, and the mistress swooped in.

00:11:24.905 --> 00:11:27.345
I slaved away, barely surviving,

00:11:27.425 --> 00:11:30.185
just to take care of myself and raise you

00:11:30.265 --> 00:11:32.385
while they lived comfortably.

00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:34.665
The one in trouble was me.

00:11:34.745 --> 00:11:37.105
I wanted to take the best care of you.

00:11:39.745 --> 00:11:42.385
And who lived comfortably? That mistress.

00:11:43.025 --> 00:11:45.585
The mistress became the legal wife,

00:11:45.665 --> 00:11:47.785
admired and respected.

00:11:48.305 --> 00:11:51.785
Who even remembers
she was once a mistress?

00:11:57.705 --> 00:11:58.545
Lin,

00:11:59.545 --> 00:12:01.825
why couldn't you just close one eye?

00:12:03.585 --> 00:12:07.305
I don't want you to be stupid
and walk away like I did.

00:12:09.505 --> 00:12:12.785
If you walk away now, you get nothing.

00:12:13.505 --> 00:12:14.665
But if you stay,

00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:17.785
even if those two love each other,

00:12:17.865 --> 00:12:20.025
everything will still be yours.

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:28.105
I don't want you to struggle like me.

00:12:29.705 --> 00:12:32.305
Better to endure than to suffer.

00:12:35.585 --> 00:12:38.145
How long
can a photographer's career really last?

00:12:39.785 --> 00:12:42.545
Someday you won't earn
as much as you do now.

00:12:43.225 --> 00:12:46.385
What then?

00:12:47.905 --> 00:12:49.345
Think carefully.

00:13:39.265 --> 00:13:42.545
Oh my, with that much green,
I'll have to invest more.

00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:44.305
Wow.

00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:45.225
AOM

00:13:45.305 --> 00:13:47.105
Whoa, Aom, you're interrupting me.

00:13:48.385 --> 00:13:50.265
Yes, Aom?

00:13:55.985 --> 00:13:59.425
Calm down. Do you want to go out and talk?

00:14:00.585 --> 00:14:01.425
Alright.

00:14:02.545 --> 00:14:03.785
What's wrong with Aunt Aom?

00:14:03.865 --> 00:14:05.905
She had a fight with Lin. A big one.

00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:07.945
You go check on Lin.

00:14:08.865 --> 00:14:10.025
Hurry up.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:46.385
Lin.

00:14:47.585 --> 00:14:49.825
I know you can hear me.

00:15:02.745 --> 00:15:05.425
If what I said earlier made you upset,

00:15:06.265 --> 00:15:07.785
I'm sorry.

00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:11.225
If you can only see me as a friend,

00:15:16.465 --> 00:15:18.185
then I'll just be a friend.

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:22.065
I just want you to know

00:15:22.705 --> 00:15:24.505
I'll always be by your side.

00:15:26.785 --> 00:15:29.025
Remember our promise?

00:15:30.185 --> 00:15:32.065
That I'd never leave you?

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:37.625
I really meant it.

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:18.145
I already sent your shirt to the cleaners.

00:16:31.185 --> 00:16:33.425
CAN I LOVE YOU?

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:42.785
If you have time,

00:16:42.865 --> 00:16:45.425
read what Lin wrote.

00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:12.665
Nothing.

00:17:22.025 --> 00:17:23.184
Lin.

00:17:25.224 --> 00:17:26.424
Jane.

00:17:52.545 --> 00:17:54.265
I didn't mean it like that.

00:17:55.185 --> 00:17:56.305
Mean what?

00:17:57.425 --> 00:17:58.745
I wasn't angry

00:18:00.025 --> 00:18:02.385
when you asked if I could love you.

00:18:05.625 --> 00:18:06.865
I wasn't angry

00:18:08.985 --> 00:18:10.265
when you kissed me.

00:18:13.785 --> 00:18:15.905
I feel good when I'm with you.

00:18:20.785 --> 00:18:22.385
You make me feel

00:18:23.345 --> 00:18:25.425
excited when you come close,

00:18:28.225 --> 00:18:29.945
shy when you look at me.

00:18:34.265 --> 00:18:36.105
Since I came back,

00:18:40.025 --> 00:18:41.985
it's not the same anymore.

00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:54.505
It's more than friendship.

00:19:50.945 --> 00:19:52.385
What are these flowers? So cute.

00:19:53.185 --> 00:19:54.505
Lily of the valley.

00:19:55.545 --> 00:19:57.065
They're this tiny?

00:20:07.505 --> 00:20:08.345
Jane.

00:20:09.385 --> 00:20:12.465
Jane, there are flowers
delivered at the front.

00:20:14.785 --> 00:20:18.025
Same sender, same flowers. Every 15th,

00:20:18.105 --> 00:20:19.865
like lottery day.

00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:28.665
If I finish the food photos today,

00:20:30.025 --> 00:20:31.065
can I take one of you too?

00:20:32.465 --> 00:20:33.625
Up to you.

00:20:37.425 --> 00:20:38.945
Jane,

00:20:39.025 --> 00:20:41.785
I'll put the flowers in a vase.

00:20:41.865 --> 00:20:43.185
I'll get the vase.

00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:44.585
Let's go.

00:20:45.985 --> 00:20:47.825
Go.

00:21:03.825 --> 00:21:04.865
Don't you think so too?

00:21:13.945 --> 00:21:16.905
I'm sure of it.

00:21:18.225 --> 00:21:19.385
Sure of what?

00:21:20.825 --> 00:21:24.105
They're together.

00:21:24.705 --> 00:21:26.545
-Yeah.
-Oh?

00:21:27.345 --> 00:21:28.745
Aren't they just close friends?

00:21:28.825 --> 00:21:30.185
Come on.

00:21:30.265 --> 00:21:32.545
Please.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.345
The couple vibes are stronger

00:21:34.425 --> 00:21:36.545
than the garlic I fried earlier.

00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:38.665
If I'm wrong,

00:21:38.745 --> 00:21:42.265
you can rub garlic in both my eyes.

00:21:42.865 --> 00:21:45.345
You're insane.

00:21:52.025 --> 00:21:53.185
What about the flower sender?

00:22:31.625 --> 00:22:33.505
You do all this alone every day?

00:22:35.865 --> 00:22:36.985
Don't you get bored?

00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:39.625
Not really. There's one day off each week.

00:22:40.145 --> 00:22:41.745
And I get to do what I love.

00:23:06.945 --> 00:23:08.185
Lin.

00:23:09.625 --> 00:23:10.505
Come on.

00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:16.185
Jane.

00:23:19.705 --> 00:23:21.585
Can I sleep over tonight?

00:23:22.545 --> 00:23:24.265
I don't want to face my mom.

00:23:25.185 --> 00:23:28.665
Then text Aunt Aom so she won't worry.

00:23:38.025 --> 00:23:39.865
Aunt Tuk's probably over there.

00:23:42.065 --> 00:23:43.465
Mom needs to vent.

00:23:44.105 --> 00:23:47.225
It's good she gets to talk.
She'll be in a better mood tomorrow.

00:23:47.945 --> 00:23:51.465
Right. Let her vent as much as she wants.

00:24:00.665 --> 00:24:02.385
You shower first. I'll wait.

00:24:16.145 --> 00:24:18.585
Why didn't you write anything
for me back then?

00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:20.705
I did.

00:24:21.585 --> 00:24:22.865
You never read it?

00:24:25.025 --> 00:24:28.585
When you left, I was so mad.
I never looked at it.

00:24:29.345 --> 00:24:30.745
I only just pulled it out today.

00:24:36.105 --> 00:24:36.945
Here.

00:24:43.465 --> 00:24:44.945
I'M SORRY… I COULDN'T KEEP MY PROMISE,
LIN

00:24:54.945 --> 00:24:59.945
I'M SORRY… I COULDN'T KEEP MY PROMISE,
LIN

00:25:08.345 --> 00:25:10.745
That time I wanted to say sorry.
But I couldn't admit…

00:25:13.225 --> 00:25:15.345
I broke our promise.

00:25:19.665 --> 00:25:21.225
So I wrote it on the shirt.

00:25:22.065 --> 00:25:23.465
I thought if you read it,

00:25:26.505 --> 00:25:27.825
you'd know…

00:25:30.985 --> 00:25:33.305
I failed our promise.

00:25:55.705 --> 00:25:56.625
But today…

00:26:02.985 --> 00:26:04.785
can we make a new one?

00:26:06.465 --> 00:26:07.665
What promise?

00:26:11.905 --> 00:26:13.785
That if this doesn't work,

00:26:17.305 --> 00:26:18.705
we'll go back to how we were.

00:26:40.185 --> 00:26:42.425
Don't disappear from my life again.

00:29:20.905 --> 00:29:22.385
Why are you staring?

00:29:24.305 --> 00:29:25.785
You're making me shy.

00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:34.985
Actually, I do remember that night.

00:29:38.825 --> 00:29:40.305
The night you were drunk?

00:29:43.665 --> 00:29:45.145
You remember everything?

00:30:04.625 --> 00:30:05.945
But here,

00:30:06.665 --> 00:30:08.025
I'm not hurting anymore.

00:30:13.505 --> 00:30:15.385
You said you couldn't remember.

00:30:17.505 --> 00:30:19.185
It just feels strange…

00:30:19.705 --> 00:30:21.745
From friends, and then suddenly…

00:30:29.825 --> 00:30:31.265
Does it still feel strange?

00:30:34.665 --> 00:30:35.785
Does it?

00:30:42.025 --> 00:30:43.225
Not anymore.

00:30:56.585 --> 00:30:58.465
When you go back to New York,

00:30:59.065 --> 00:31:01.025
I'll miss you so much.

00:31:05.225 --> 00:31:06.825
I might not go back.

00:31:08.665 --> 00:31:09.705
What about work?

00:31:13.785 --> 00:31:15.145
I don't know yet.

00:31:16.505 --> 00:31:18.025
But if things work out,

00:31:19.345 --> 00:31:20.865
you'll be the first to know.

00:31:21.625 --> 00:31:23.945
I don't want you to go anywhere.

00:31:27.705 --> 00:31:29.545
I don't want to either.

00:32:15.785 --> 00:32:17.345
Can't you just not answer?

00:32:20.585 --> 00:32:21.945
It might be important.

00:32:23.985 --> 00:32:25.305
One sec.

00:32:42.185 --> 00:32:43.385
Good news?

00:32:44.225 --> 00:32:45.105
Yes!

00:32:45.185 --> 00:32:48.905
And I need a favor from you.

00:32:48.985 --> 00:32:51.905
What could you possibly need from me?

00:32:51.985 --> 00:32:53.345
A lot.

00:32:53.425 --> 00:32:55.705
Will you shoot a fashion set for me?

00:33:00.105 --> 00:33:02.065
How could I say no to you?

00:33:02.665 --> 00:33:03.745
See you soon.

00:33:12.105 --> 00:33:14.625
Pie? Why is she calling?

00:33:18.785 --> 00:33:19.825
Jane.

00:33:20.585 --> 00:33:22.505
What did she want, calling this early?

00:33:23.105 --> 00:33:24.145
Work stuff.

00:33:29.745 --> 00:33:32.025
Aunt Tuk and Aunt Aom went out of town.

00:33:33.545 --> 00:33:35.785
I'M GOING TO THE BEACH WITH AUNT AOM
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. TAKE CARE. AUNT TUK

00:33:35.865 --> 00:33:37.345
For over a week?

00:33:43.465 --> 00:33:45.465
Mom must be so mad

00:33:45.985 --> 00:33:47.625
she doesn't even want to see me.

00:33:50.465 --> 00:33:51.505
Don't overthink it.

00:33:52.105 --> 00:33:53.985
She might just need time.

00:33:56.065 --> 00:33:57.105
Thanks.

00:34:02.665 --> 00:34:03.825
Tasty.

00:34:04.425 --> 00:34:06.825
The restaurant's closed today.
Want to go to the beach?

00:34:13.304 --> 00:34:14.344
Can we go next week?

00:34:17.784 --> 00:34:18.985
Are you busy?

00:34:21.185 --> 00:34:22.105
Well,

00:34:22.665 --> 00:34:24.824
I just made plans with Pie.

00:34:29.264 --> 00:34:30.145
Well,

00:34:30.665 --> 00:34:34.145
she wants to go over details.

00:34:36.625 --> 00:34:39.465
Then at least eat before you go.

00:34:46.264 --> 00:34:47.784
Can I eat later?

00:34:48.425 --> 00:34:50.665
I need to shower
and get ready or I'll be late.

00:34:51.545 --> 00:34:52.505
She's in such a rush?

00:34:53.945 --> 00:34:56.025
I still need to prepare
references for her.

00:34:57.945 --> 00:34:58.945
That's fine.

00:35:00.065 --> 00:35:01.385
Thanks for understanding.

00:35:28.225 --> 00:35:30.625
We can raise our kids,

00:35:30.705 --> 00:35:33.625
guide them about right and wrong,

00:35:33.705 --> 00:35:36.145
but in the end, it's their choice, Aom.

00:35:37.825 --> 00:35:40.145
I just want her to live comfortably.

00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:42.105
I don't want her to suffer like I did.

00:35:43.945 --> 00:35:46.065
But it's her life, isn't it?

00:35:49.705 --> 00:35:51.025
Look at Jane.

00:35:51.625 --> 00:35:54.825
She was a five-star hotel chef
with a steady paycheck.

00:35:54.905 --> 00:35:56.385
One day, she wanted to quit

00:35:56.465 --> 00:35:58.745
to open a small restaurant at home.

00:36:00.025 --> 00:36:01.345
Of course, I worried.

00:36:01.425 --> 00:36:04.025
I didn't know if she'd succeed.

00:36:06.385 --> 00:36:09.585
But my role is to cheer her on

00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:12.665
and support her choice.

00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:15.785
It's not the same, Tuk.

00:36:17.545 --> 00:36:19.425
I know she has the right

00:36:19.505 --> 00:36:21.585
to choose her own path.

00:36:22.425 --> 00:36:24.465
Marriage is hard.

00:36:24.545 --> 00:36:27.105
You've never married, you don't know.

00:36:27.865 --> 00:36:30.185
Sometimes you have to close one eye.

00:36:30.265 --> 00:36:33.745
Look at me.
Pride doesn't put food on the table.

00:36:34.265 --> 00:36:37.145
I walked away and had to suffer alone.

00:36:37.225 --> 00:36:40.665
If I had stayed and pretended not to know,

00:36:40.745 --> 00:36:43.465
maybe Lin and I
wouldn't have struggled so much.

00:36:47.185 --> 00:36:50.465
I just want Lin
to think of it from that side too.

00:36:51.505 --> 00:36:55.545
I know she's hurt that Kate betrayed her.

00:36:56.385 --> 00:36:58.385
But can't she forgive her?

00:36:59.145 --> 00:37:02.025
Give her one more chance?

00:37:02.625 --> 00:37:06.185
Maybe she just made a mistake.

00:37:06.705 --> 00:37:09.905
Who else will look after her for life

00:37:09.985 --> 00:37:11.665
like Kate would?

00:38:05.505 --> 00:38:08.065
Your references look
exactly like what she wanted.

00:38:09.345 --> 00:38:11.225
Now I believe what they say,

00:38:11.305 --> 00:38:13.865
working with talented people is easy.

00:38:15.825 --> 00:38:18.705
You must have some faith in me

00:38:18.785 --> 00:38:20.265
to trust me with this project.

00:38:23.145 --> 00:38:25.265
I like working with you…

00:38:26.785 --> 00:38:28.065
specially.

00:38:31.025 --> 00:38:32.625
You haven't told me

00:38:32.705 --> 00:38:34.505
who the model is yet.

00:38:36.105 --> 00:38:37.865
You're gonna be so happy.

00:38:38.545 --> 00:38:39.385
Yeah?

00:38:40.465 --> 00:38:43.025
I personally contacted her
to work with you,

00:38:43.545 --> 00:38:44.705
and she accepted.

00:38:45.705 --> 00:38:46.945
Who is she?

00:38:47.745 --> 00:38:51.025
Ayla, the hottest singer right now.

00:38:55.585 --> 00:38:57.825
She'll be thrilled

00:38:57.905 --> 00:39:00.225
that the protographer

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:02.465
is you.

00:39:06.585 --> 00:39:09.505
And maybe if you and I work well together,

00:39:11.585 --> 00:39:13.385
we can keep doing it long-term.

00:39:17.305 --> 00:39:19.425
Let's see how this one goes first.

00:39:20.105 --> 00:39:22.305
Let's talk about location references

00:39:22.385 --> 00:39:24.465
so we know where to shoot.

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:10.225
Planning to stay forever,
like an ancestor shrine?

00:40:22.905 --> 00:40:25.905
If you're here this long,
you might as well be a spirit shrine.

00:40:25.985 --> 00:40:27.705
Ancestor shrine doesn't suit you.

00:40:36.585 --> 00:40:38.305
I really like you when you're working.

00:40:39.905 --> 00:40:41.305
Do I look happy?

00:40:41.945 --> 00:40:44.065
Yes. You look so happy.

00:40:44.145 --> 00:40:46.225
It makes me enjoy the work too.

00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:50.025
Before the actual shoot,

00:40:50.105 --> 00:40:52.265
we'll need a location check.

00:40:52.345 --> 00:40:55.825
Thank you for accepting my project.

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:30.065
Did Jane do all this by herself?

00:41:36.745 --> 00:41:37.905
Done talking already?

00:41:39.745 --> 00:41:42.545
Yeah. And I've got good news.

00:41:48.905 --> 00:41:50.905
That took forever.

00:41:52.505 --> 00:41:55.225
Jane, what's wrong? Are you mad?

00:41:55.305 --> 00:41:56.305
Yes.

00:41:56.905 --> 00:41:59.985
Wouldn't you be
if you saw me with someone else like that?

00:42:01.105 --> 00:42:04.345
You know how betrayal feels.

00:42:05.105 --> 00:42:08.385
Betrayal? With Pie?

00:42:09.665 --> 00:42:11.625
Jane, there's nothing like that.

00:42:11.705 --> 00:42:14.665
How can you say that?
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:42:15.665 --> 00:42:17.945
If you're hanging around
like a spirit shrine,

00:42:18.025 --> 00:42:19.745
Shaman Jane's gonna smash it down.

00:42:19.825 --> 00:42:21.345
What were you two talking about so long?

00:42:48.985 --> 00:42:50.105
Jane.

00:42:54.145 --> 00:42:56.065
I'm glad I ran into you.

00:42:57.745 --> 00:43:01.265
Lin is so sweet, and talented too.

00:43:02.185 --> 00:43:04.985
Since we'll be working together,

00:43:05.065 --> 00:43:06.305
I'll see her often.

00:43:07.865 --> 00:43:10.225
I think it's because

00:43:10.305 --> 00:43:11.665
we're in the same field,

00:43:11.745 --> 00:43:14.505
it's easy to talk, easy to click.

00:43:14.585 --> 00:43:15.985
I didn't ask.

00:43:17.665 --> 00:43:19.065
I just wanted to say

00:43:19.145 --> 00:43:22.185
when people share interests,

00:43:22.265 --> 00:43:25.225
it's easy to connect.

00:43:26.425 --> 00:43:29.225
If we date,

00:43:30.425 --> 00:43:32.745
I'll be seeing you a lot.

00:43:32.825 --> 00:43:35.425
And if I take some of Lin's time,

00:43:38.745 --> 00:43:40.225
don't be mad, okay?

00:43:44.505 --> 00:43:47.905
Are you sure you weren't
talking about every single detail?

00:43:48.825 --> 00:43:49.705
Jane.

00:43:50.585 --> 00:43:53.945
Jane, there's nothing more than that.

00:44:00.465 --> 00:44:01.705
You lied.

00:44:02.705 --> 00:44:05.465
How can you lie to me so easily?

00:44:06.065 --> 00:44:08.785
Just go. I want to be alone.

00:44:12.905 --> 00:44:14.225
If you want to be mad, fine.

00:44:14.305 --> 00:44:16.345
But won't you at least hear me out?

00:44:17.105 --> 00:44:19.905
If you always assume on your own,
how can we ever work?

00:44:20.585 --> 00:44:23.585
That way, your relationships
won't last with anyone, Jane.

00:45:01.825 --> 00:45:03.265
Are you really not going to talk to me?

00:45:04.385 --> 00:45:05.505
Jane,

00:45:06.105 --> 00:45:08.585
Lin's still waiting outside.

00:45:08.665 --> 00:45:11.065
How much do you trust her?

00:45:11.785 --> 00:45:13.345
If you do…

00:45:13.425 --> 00:45:15.665
-Then don't question it.
-Exactly.

00:45:15.745 --> 00:45:17.185
You want me to be a fool?

00:45:17.265 --> 00:45:18.505
Are you asking me
to be your business partner?

00:45:18.585 --> 00:45:20.905
-Yes.
-I can give you time.

00:45:20.985 --> 00:45:24.345
But I won't let you turn your back on me
for something I never did.

00:45:56.785 --> 00:45:58.665
