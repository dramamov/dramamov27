and 300 warning signs.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.700
So, what does that make this situation?

(Revoke the Hangang University Merger)

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.670
How did we end up in this mess?

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.350
I thought it was just a GitHub push, like a single commit message.

(Dept. of Converged Physical Tech and Global Content Development)

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.020
But the errors piled up without any alerts,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.430
and between the conflicts I just glossed over,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.030
what were you and I missing?

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.600
What if we were already infected?

- This is a sophisticated virus. - Hey, emergency!

Emergency!

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.479
It puts us both at risk,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.850
but strangely, it keeps the system on.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.190
Anyway, what we need to do now is debug.

All the way back to that moment we thought was our safe zone,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.290
let's rewind the timeline.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.390
Find the first log entry of this disaster.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.900
Let's start with your stereotypical image of an engineering student.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.700
Black backpack with a water bottle, a three-fold umbrella on the left,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.970
unstyled hair,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.040
and cheap horn-rimmed glasses.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.680
And on top of that, pants with a questionable fit.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.950
And a plaid shirt you can draw graphs on in a pinch.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.190
But what's missing is a subtitle for the year.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.519
Visit a Korean engineering school now,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.890
and you'll quickly realise...

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.390
how distorted your information and narrow-minded your views are.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.129
Ten-dollar horn-rimmed glasses?

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.130
These are Gentle Monster, those are Moscot,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.200
and these are Projekt Produkt. Unstyled hair? Give me a break!

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.940
They use conditioner, treatments, and even get Brazilian waxes.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.810
Don't get me started on the fantasy of the "Belle of Engineering."

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.219
She's pretty, has a great body,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.780
and is a pro at soldering and gaming.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.790
She helps price parts at Yongsan. She's cool with the returnees.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.760
Who is it? Who makes up these stereotypes?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.030
Who is it?

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.360
Who the heck is spreading this crap about us?

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.730
And another thing.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.029
Since we're not a Seoul university,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.270
campus dramas don't film at our school.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.270
Stuck on the outskirts of the city, where it blizzards on the first day.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.770
It is a little embarrassing.

(Hangang University)

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.380
And in the middle of this bizarre weather,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.250
that Tinder Guy asked you to come all the way out to Seoul, right?

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.550
Yes.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.350
He asked me to come to his place and fix his desktop?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.920
Said no one was going to be home for a few days.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.020
It's obvious what he was trying to pull.

What do you expect from a guy who posts shirtless profile pics?

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.500
Says the guy who met his girlfriend on an app?

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.170
It's different for guys and girls, okay?

(Notes: Dept. Rep, aka Kang Dong Won, is taken)

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.640
I was explaining a system restore, and then he said he already knew.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.610
Because I'm an engineering student, he wanted to see if I was for real.

(Notes: BL fangirl, pastor's daughter)

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.879
He got defensive and put down my school.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.990
He bragged about his school in Seoul.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.820
How tiresome. So?

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.960
I couldn't let it slide, so I dissed my own school right back at him,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.330
and told him the new name of our department.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.860
He told me to stop making it up. He asked, "What department is that?"

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.470
- Oppose the Engineering merger! - Oppose!

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.310
Save the Department of Computer Engineering!

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.410

The merger of Computer Engineering and Modelling, effective this spring.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.120
A combination of buzzwords.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.020
I guess you could call this a bug too.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.690
No less than Dept. Converged Tech and Content Dev.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.730
But really, why should I care?

If we don't foster interdisciplinary convergence,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.080
we can't navigate the rough seas of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.180

Right. They're just broke.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.660
Or wait, Con-Tech-Con?

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.630
Guys, let's stop trying to adapt and start fighting back.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.800
A surprise merger during the break? This is basically a scam. Right?

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.070
When we enrolled, they kept talking about becoming the "next KAIST."

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.350
They promised full scholarships. But look at us and KAIST now.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.480
The only thing we have in common is the Jang Yeong Sil statue.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.550
Even that's different.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.420
KAIST has a full-body statue of him. Ours is, well, as you can see.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.770
So that's what it is. They were prepping this for the merger.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.000
It looks so sloppy and rushed. The art styles are so different.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.140
You're right, Dong Won.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.680
The art styles really are completely different.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.360
Which one is the CompSci major and which one is the Modelling major?

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.890
It's so obvious which is which...

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.130
that "convergence" hardly seems like the right word.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.800
But having these prickly pretty boys around,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.540
I guess that kind of diversity isn't so bad after all.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.040
What do you mean, "not so bad?" They got a grant for "innovation."

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.380
Our scholarships were cut in half, our budget was cut in half,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.710

- Excuse me, sir. Your name and... - You know, back in my day...

Yet, the school's main contributors haven't uttered a single complaint.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.100
Like your star client and her brother.

That's right. And she's shooting a commercial at Jang Yeong Sil Hall?

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.450
Yes.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.750
Always boosting campus revenue, I see.

The director insisted on this place. This lounge really is gorgeous.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.830
So she's shooting that ad with Jennie from Blackpink here?

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.500
Not quite. It's Jinny, an older idol but just as famous and popular.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.570
- Jinny? - You know her, right?

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.570
Of course, of course.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.670
I'm all about relating to Gen MZ, you know?

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.650
In fact, that new department name? That was my idea.

(Dept. of Converged Physical Tech and Global Content Development)

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.750
That explains it.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.420
It sounded so trendy.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.420
Now, let's see.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.990
So, about what time will her brother be here?

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.760
Well... He wanted to see the new campus.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.030

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.170
- What a joke! What a joke! - What a joke! What a joke!

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.340
Engineering degree for being tall? Makes no sense! Makes no sense!

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.440

Are you seriously asking because you don't...

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.470
You have every right to ask.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.810
You absolutely should ask. This has nothing to do with you...

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.850
It's not about you guys personally. Not at all.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.050
Exactly. It's not about individuals. Everyone's special in their own way.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.050
That's a relief.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.160
I'll read this over and come find you again, okay?

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.760
Yes, of course.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.360
Got it.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.230
See you around.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.300
Yeah, definitely come back!

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.110
Dude, he's gotta be a celebrity. He's way too good-looking.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.410
- We should've gotten his autograph. - He totally is, right?

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.580

No. I'm a CompSci major.

We heard a celebrity was coming today.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.420
A celebrity?

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.690
The model from Match on Wheels! Kang Min Hak!

Will you please keep it down?

She's a huge fan of his, so we all tagged along.

Her name's hilarious, isn't it? Ahn In Dae.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.180
- Gosh, TMI. - That's not TMI.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.720
But you guys really aren't supposed to be signing this.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.360
- Please, not you too. - She's actually kind of funny.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.730
Hilarious.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.200
That's Kang Dong Won for you. Living up to his handsome namesake.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.700
Yeah. "Converged Physical" definitely suits you.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.000
Hey, you two should be the ones joining in.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.210
I don't know if this will help, but...

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.280
Converged Technology, or whatever.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.580
If you don't sign, that's what will be printed on your diploma.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.220
But does our department name matter? For developers, experience is key.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.420
You sound like you're in favour of the merger.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.520
Why do you have to put it like that?

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.660
- Hey, write neatly in the box. - Okay, okay.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.980
Excuse me, do you know which building C103 is in?

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.390
My map app says it's this way, but...

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.150
I can show you the way. I happen to be heading there myself.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.760
Really? Thank you.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.160
No, thank you.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:57.900
Shall we?

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.960
See you again!

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.600
Take care.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.940
So much for solidarity in our major.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.880
They chose us over the other majors. They knew we were pushovers.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.950
Wow, this lounge is huge.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.980
Sa Ni, you seem kinda excited about this yourself.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.320
Don't tell me you're for the merger, too.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.960
Does the department name matter? Not for a developer.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.760
Not you too!

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.360
For a developer, it's all about the gear.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.560
And I just got a new setup.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.410
Intel Core Ultra 200HX and a GeForce RTX 5070.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.410
Data storage is a Super RAID 5.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.040
Okay. Congratulations, I guess.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.380
Excuse me, could you sign this?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.950
Bet you're wondering where I suddenly got all this cash.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.320
Not really.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.590
Here.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.050
I consulted on a TV script for some clueless liberal arts majors.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.260
A TV show?

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.190
It was a freelance gig. A client set me up over winter break,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.100
and I met a writer, director, and producer who are big shots.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.830
"We're making a campus drama set in the Computer Engineering Dept."

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.800
"A genius coder uninterested in love falls for a cold startup guy."

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.040
Sounds boring already, but... what can you do? It's work.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.579
The problem is, the writers are all liberal arts majors...

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.640
who know nothing.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.850
Like what the professors are saying in the background...

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.050
or what today's engineers or IT professionals in 2025...

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.990
how they talk, what they care about. They were completely clueless.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.560
So, with a script full of hundreds, even thousands, of errors,

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.529
I started my nitpicky edits,

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.500
and they suddenly started complaining.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.839
"We want to focus on the love story..."

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.879
"And, you know, a real love story..."

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.810
"doesn't unfold before a laptop or behind a lectern."

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.220
"Are you an extreme 'T' on the MBTI or something?"

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.650
"No. I don't like being defined by MBTI."

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.960
So I just took my advance and we terminated the contract.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:08.830
Which was a total win for me, anyway.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.700
Congratulations again.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.999
Thanks to that, I upgraded to a laptop...

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.200
that's about 3.7 times more powerful,

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.800
so my compile time will be 2.5 times faster,

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.740
and if I use that time to take on 0.8 more freelance gigs a month,

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.980
I can get out of this place at least six months sooner.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.810
The reason I'm sharing my stats with you in such detail is...

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.710
I know. You're trying to rope me into your project.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.380
I'm being serious.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.620
We're running out of time.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.190
Time?

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:41.030
Seoul's average temp rose last year. Just look outside.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.160
It's March, and we got hit with a sudden cold snap.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.330
I know, right? It even snowed on the first day of the semester.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.600
The college merger is the least of our problems right now.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.399
You know me. If the world were ending,

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.470
I'm the type to plant an apple tree.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.239
But we must control what's immediate.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.240
For you, that's the Student Council,

00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.310
and for me...

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.879
Hey, the scholarship results are up!

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.950
Hey, they're posted, they're posted!

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.079
Sweet!

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.150
Are you checking it? Is it posted?

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.719
A full ride!

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.320
Guys, I got it! Oh my gosh!

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.360
Wait, what is this?

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.830
Where the heck is this place supposed to be?

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.960
What?

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.300
What?

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.770
This way? Gosh, darn it.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.600
Not interested.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.510
- It's freezing, freezing, freezing. - Excuse me.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.710
Excuse me. Ex-excuse me. Hey, excuse me.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.150
Hey!

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:38.780
What's with this guy?

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.990
Sorry, would you happen to know where the Dean's Office is?

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.560
Which college's dean? And from what department?

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.920
One sec.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.200
Converged Physical Technology...

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.130
- Glo... - Dept. of Global Content Dev?

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.230
Yes, that's the one.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.340
For the former Comp. Eng. Dean's Office,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.800
head to Jang Yeong Sil Hall.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.440
Jang Yeong Sil... Isn't Jang Yeong Sil Hall this way?

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:08.050
Nope! Most go through the main gate and the College of Human Ecology,

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.810
and cross the Cloud Bridge. But if you need the Dean's Office,

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.080
it's faster via the Central Library. Got it?

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.960
- Right. So I should... - So he didn't get any of that.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.430
In terms of sheer distance, the Human Ecology route is faster,

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.930
but that calculation doesn't account for the elevator algorithm.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.129
Elevators were replaced last year,

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.500
and now the two are dumb and in sync.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.270
And why do you suppose that is?

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:35.910
Beats me.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.210
Like I said, they must've changed the algorithm.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.850
It used to check each car's distance to the user's selected floor...

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.750
and send whichever one was closer.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.990
- So that way... - I'll assume you've got it, then.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.960
So cool. That's the engineering student vibe.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.030
Can I get your Instagram handle?

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.400
No, it's just, you look so familiar.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.400
If you're not comfortable, you really don't have to. It's fine.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:06.770
Give it here.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.310
You have a cute name.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.940
Yang Na Rae.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.679
Na Rae, Na Rae, Yang Na Rae

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.780
That's how I'll remember it.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.280
Stop.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.290
No way. 20,000 followers?

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.260
So you must be the top dog in the Modelling Major, then.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.090
20,000 followers is nothing.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.930
A classmate has a million followers. See?

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.990
A million followers?

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.860
For just one of his Reels,

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.370
he makes, what, like five grand?

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.870
You don't know him? Kang Min Hak.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.820
- For me, that's a lot of money. - It is for everyone.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.260
I understand the scholarship review can be subjective,

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.960
and there was some negative wording in my letter of recommendation,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.360
"While not lacking the talent required for academic success..."

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.500
"she only seeks her own glory." Is that the part you mean?

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.440
This is from Dean Gi Myo Han, I see.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:17.880
I didn't realise our evaluations would have our names attached,

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:22.580
I may have slipped up last semester, but did you see my GPA is a 4.28?

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.350
- Computer Science and Engineering? - Yes.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.779
Major in CompSci and Engineering,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.150
School of Converged Tech and Content.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:34.090
But you applied as a CompSci Major. That's your old department name.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.100
It's from a duplicate registration, and we can't resubmit it for you,

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.030
we've been trying to contact you to correct and resubmit it.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.640
But I never received anything.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.670
Yes, you never picked up. Not our calls or our texts.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.140
We even contacted you yesterday.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.280
That's impossible. If I check my call log...

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.810
It is in my call log.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.850
I implemented an SVM model and ran a simple test on my phone,

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.990
It's projected to stop 81% of spam. With more data from Jan and Feb...

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.060
Okay, okay, guys. Sorry to interrupt your game.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.930
I can't believe my spam beta app made this mistake.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.599
So if I change the name...

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.600
to Converged Physical and Global Content...

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.430
and apply again, that should fix it right? It's a simple fix?

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.840
It was, until yesterday.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.510
It's now a special exception, so you have to start over.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.440
And get the dean's signature.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.510
The dean?

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.050
The Peculiar Dean.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.550
We have distinguished guests today, but this spring weather is amazing.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.620
Anyway, this climate crisis these days...

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.460
We'd appreciate it if you could be flexible with his classes.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.190
Besides, it's all practical training for his major.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.160
Attendance? That's not a problem.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.000
Just be discreet about it.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.000
- Excuse me. - Yes? Was there something?

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.400
I was looking into it,

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.240
and CompSci has many classes that could be useful for models.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.770
- Is that so? - Yes, look here.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.940
There's something called Cap Design?

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.380
- For making hats or something? - Hats?

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.020
- Caps? - Cap...

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.450
Oh!

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.320
Oh, that. That's, that's called "Capstone Design."

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.790
It's a senior class for solving engineering problems, basically.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.230
- Right. I saw one for "running." - Running?

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.730
Oh, we models only learn how to walk.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.340
Hey, they teach running in the College of Engineering.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.870
That's probably "Machine Learning." But anyway.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.580
Machine?

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.250
Anyway, I'd like to try taking classes like that.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.250
Machine Learning.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.150
Cool Running.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.090
That would be a perfect name for a running crew.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.360
Wow.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.230
Capstone...

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.760
Stone?

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.170
Thank you again for your time.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.800
Then it's settled. You'll observe my class that day.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.710
- It's great for the school's promo. - Yes, that would be...

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.280
- Right. Goodness, thank you. - Yes, of course.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.350
Take care.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.480
- I'm all about that recycling life. - Min Hak! Awesome morning!

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.550
Hey.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.290
Right.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.060
Hey!

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.330
My follower count suddenly shot up.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.360
I'm at, like, 998,000 now.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.130
Really?

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.330
That's great. You were stuck there for a while.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.840
Yeah, and some of my new fans have really funny usernames.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.140
Check this out.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.570
Chun Nyeon Hak, Jong Yi Hak. And get this, Ahn In Dae.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.480
What?

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.250
No, if someone's name is Ahn In Dae...

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.450
say they come to a fan signing. And I ask, "What's your name?"

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.749
and they say, "I'm Ahn In Dae."

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.420
I couldn't tell if they aren't a fan,

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.319
or if their name is really Ahn In Dae.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.160
It'd be so confusing, right?

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.060
This is no time for jokes.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.000
Yeah, like that. I'm pretty good at riffing on stuff.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.040
- Hey, I was wondering... - The lounge is nice. Want to go?

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.670
What?

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.340
What? I thought you were into that whole engineering student vibe.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.250
We should scout out the engineering building beforehand.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:17.550
But just a minute ago...

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.720
you gave me a look for even bringing up the class.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.220
My bad. I wasn't thinking.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.520
With the merger, that engineering student look could help your career.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.530
That's how we landed that laptop commercial.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:30.790
That I landed for you.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.430
I know. That's why I suggested wearing my bangs down.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.330
Good call. Forewarned is forearmed.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.630
What does that mean?

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.640
(Study Plan)

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.840
"By leveraging the IT and tech from the Yeong Sil Scholarship,"

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.710
"not for my own personal success,"

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:52.350
"but to help advance humanity?" You? Seriously?

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.880
Don't talk to me. The deadline's in ten minutes.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.349
How did you miss that?

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.520
They sent so many notices to reapply.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.830
Stop nagging and contribute a line. I'm all out of fancy words.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.160
Guys! You're not going to believe this!

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.529
This is huge. Huge!

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.200
A student here has one million followers.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.330
- One million followers? - Yep.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.200
That can't be a million students at Hangang University.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.240
So, one of a million followers just happens to be a student here?

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.140
Those aren't very surprising odds.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.810
No! Someone with a million followers is in our Modelling Major!

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:26.750
A person with one million followers. Here, on this remote campus.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.620
A celebrity like that has graced us with their presence.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.220
I doubt that empty online popularity matters at Hangang University.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.690
It's not entirely meaningless.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.560
With that kind of following, for every post they upload...

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.160
They supposedly get around 5,000.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.960
Wow.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.270
- To even make minimum wage... - What?

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.640
They'd have to upload almost 20 posts an hour.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.770
Guess being famous isn't so easy.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.580
What are you talking about? Not 50 cents, 5 thousand dollars.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:58.650
- What? - That's a whole semester's tuition.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:59.750
Exactly.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.790
They get to live life that easily?

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.820
Who?

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.090
- It's Kang Min Hak! - Where?

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.760
There he is! Kang Min Hak! Wow, he's so handsome!

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.030
He's so freaking hot. So handsome.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.600
Wow, he's seriously good-looking.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.740
Wow, he's unreal!

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.790
I have a feeling he's the one. The one with a million followers.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.660
The Modelling Major we were just talking about.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.599
You're handsome, even to other guys.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.730
Loved you on "Match on Wheels!"

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.570
- Can I get your autograph? - You're so handsome!

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:50.630
Please sign this for me!

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:58.510
Why does it feel like time is moving in slow motion over there?

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.880
That's theoretically possible if the gravity is strong enough.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:07.250
You can't experience that on Earth. So Na Rae, it's an optical illusion.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:11.890
Exactly. I mean, time isn't a proven concept.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:13.660
Oh, come on!

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.390
Just look, will you?

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:20.030
When you see beauty, enjoy it. So just enjoy the view!

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.430
- But I was here first. - I'm sorry.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.139
I knew it. They're all taking photos.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.210
These nobodies with nothing to share...

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.210
are happily doing our marketing for us.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.180
- Min Hak! - Whoa, hey!

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.550
We're here to see you!

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.380
- Hey, you can't rush him like that! - Hey, you!

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.320
- Let go of me! Don't touch me! - What's with all these fangirls?

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:44.420
We're just here to see him!

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.360
Teenagers from the suburbs who rarely get to see a celebrity?

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.760
An influencer on his level is as popular as a pop idol.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.160
Tell me about it.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.530
What's his deal, anyway?

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.299
He gets five grand for a single post.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.770
Why are people so crazy about him?

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.270
So cute. Way too cute.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.080
Zoom out, cute. Zoom in, cute.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.510
From this angle or that one? Pure cuteness overload.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.420
Why am I here and not there with them?

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.520
I don't think there's anyone as perfect as he is.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.620
He is so handsome, and he is so talented.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:23.290
I think he's literally the most perfect boy...

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.360
I've ever seen.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.030
Professor Eum,

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.900
when did you get here?

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.470
So you're a K-pop fan too?

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:34.700
Is that guy from BTS?

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.650
- Sorry. - No, he is not a K-pop idol.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.210
He is actually from this dating show...

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.380
called "Match on Wheels."

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.220
On this show,

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.090
he won people over with his own special kind of charm.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.390
At first,

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.820
no one noticed him among flashier contestants.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.360
Doesn't he look really young?

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.460
- He looks like a kid. - I think he's a college student.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.460
- He looks like a college student. - He seems down-to-earth.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.270
He didn't try to stand out,

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:03.500
just quietly cared.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.069
Also fans noticed one of his sexiest traits.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.370
His serious recycling habits.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.470
Cleaning up after everyone isn't easy.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.410
He's just like me, isn't he?

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.580
While the other male cast members...

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.980
were gossiping behind backs...

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.909
and showing their unfiltered macho sides,

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:18.980
he didn't get caught up in it.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.720
No wonder the female cast members...

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.650
couldn't help but be drawn to him.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.920
- Back in high school... - Jinny, is Min Hak your type?

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.230
I think he's pretty cute.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.329
Midway through the show,

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.430
when the girls were all fighting for his attention,

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.030
I honestly felt the same.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.630
Maybe it's because the show...

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.030
has no script or direction,

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.200
just real emotions...

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.270
that Min Hak stood out even more.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.109
It's interesting.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.610
That someone like you, an elite, with advanced intellect,

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.450
would display such an inexplicable emotional response.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:50.010
I'm sorry, professor.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.510
What do you mean by that?

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.480
Okay, look at this, Nisha.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.450
If there were no crews around,

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.020
it'd be kind of hard...

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.160
to get a close-up shot like this...

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.590
from this angle in this frame.

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.230
I'm sorry, what?

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.500
Well, unless there was a drone...

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.400
the size of a fruit fly...

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:13.170
with a wide lens bigger than itself flying around the cast.

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.310
It would make sense. However,

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:21.710
given the physical and mechanical limits of current lens technology,

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.910
that's impossible.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.550
And one more thing.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:26.850
Please forgive me...

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.950
for pointing out such an obvious error.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.020
For a rational engineer,

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:33.060
this setup just doesn't fly.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:37.830
No, this is truly a bare match. No room for tricks or interference.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.500
Right. It's not like the director or writers set this up, right?

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.200
He seemed sweet, but he's a beast. He's full of surprises.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.800
- Wait a minute. - What?

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.010
- Isn't this game a bit one-sided? - How so?

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:55.450
One look, it's obviously set up for your boy.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.650
The angle opposite that kid is 160 degrees,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.150
and his opponent's angle is, what, about 100 degrees?

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.620
Then, according to the law of sines,

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.120
for that string to be in equilibrium...

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:10.730
The opponent's force is the kid's times the ratio of sines.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.399
That's 0.9848 over 0.3420, which equals...

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.760
- 2.878. - 2.878.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.669
So the other guy has to exert...

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.470
2.878 times more force than the boy...

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.970
just to maintain equilibrium and not get pulled back.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.240
(Seconds until the game ends)

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.110
The "unexpected charm" you mentioned was meticulously engineered.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.410
Gosh, I get it, Joo Yeon San.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.410
I know what you're trying to say,

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:35.490
but actually, I have no clue. How do you calculate all this stuff?

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:36.920
What? It's obvious just by looking at it.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.720
Hey, didn't you say you only had ten minutes left?

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.960
Darn it! I need The Peculiar Dean's signature.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:44.590
Oh, my!

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:49.830
Hey, make sure you have everything. Shouldn't you look more presentable?

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:54.100
Considering The Peculiar Dean's crankiness,

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.440
you have a point.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.110
Here, give me your jacket.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.640
You're very high-maintenance, Joo Yeon San.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.880
Go on.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.149
Come on, my friend's a huge fan.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.780
What? Yeah, I'm a fan too.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.120
Not happening. Move along.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.870
Hey...

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.800
Hey...

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.340
Hey!

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:29.610
Hey!

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:31.510
Wait! Hold on!

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.580
Hey!

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.680
- Gosh! - What?

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:38.880
What?

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.770
- Hey. - What?

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.070
Are you okay?

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:02.970
I guess.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:16.520
Haven't we met somewhere before?

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.390
I don't think so.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:26.860
By conventional standards, I suppose he's handsome.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.200
But what I'm experiencing now is just a personal optical illusion.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:36.340
The visible light that the human eye can perceive...

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:41.240
is a tiny part of the EM spectrum. Because of this limited range,

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:44.310
we are incapable of fully perceiving the external reality of our subject.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:49.190
To a more advanced life-form, their appearance might be hideous.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.520
No, it must be hideous.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:59.000
And your name is?

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:02.600
What? He must think I'm a fan.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.530
No.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.570
I'm Ahn In Dae.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.140
Ahn In Dae?

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:10.710
Ahn In Dae?

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.980
So you're her!

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.620
I can't believe I'm actually meeting you here today.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.120
Ahn In Dae.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.130
- Do they know each other? - No idea.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:31.760
What the heck is with this guy?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Ahn In Dae...

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.400
(Three minutes later)

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.270
Someone's in high spirits all of a sudden.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:43.140
To be honest, I was a little suspicious of you.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.170
What?

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.910
I thought maybe you'd bought all those new followers again.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.220
What? You said it felt like a scam. I wouldn't do that again.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.950
Right? You're not the type to do that twice.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.520
But Ahn In Dae, Chun Nyeon Hak...

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.560
I figured fans with weird names like that were fake.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.230
But I just met one of them in person.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:09.330
Man. My bad. I'm sorry.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.769
- Gosh. - Seriously.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:14.600
Don't worry about it. You're getting surprisingly sharp.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.440
But, kid, once we get a million, ad rates go into a new bracket.

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:19.980
How could I not buy accounts?

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:23.250
We don't need pricey Korean accounts when there are foreign ones.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:28.990
Anyway, forget about it. Just know I always have your back.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:30.490
I know.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:36.260
If you have any issues with me, just let it all out.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.560
Dude, I've got nothing like that.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.500
It's just... I was bothered you went to the dean without me.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:48.540
I was helping you get your diploma without having to commute out here.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.480
Then you suddenly say you'll take engineering, putting me in a bind.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.650
I can see that.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.580
Sorry. I'll do better.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.180
All right.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.150
I get it. It's about your first love at KAIST.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.290
That's why you have this thing for the "engineering student vibe."

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.890
What are you talking about? She wasn't my first love.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.330
We just crossed paths that one time. For 5, maybe 10 minutes?

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.230
Was your first love someone else? That quiz kid from grade school?

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.540
What are you talking about? Come on! What first love?

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.810
Excuse me, is the dean in? I have a scheduled meeting.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.280
You're three minutes late. He waited and then left.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:35.520
- But I'm only three minutes late. - That's right.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.090
My scholarship is on the line. Could you please just call him?

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:41.690
The dean really hates getting work calls.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.090
You should have come earlier.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.860
- Come back tomorrow. - Today's the application deadline.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.060
That's too bad.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.230
These celebrity autographs...

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.470
If you hadn't stopped to get this, you might have been on time.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:58.980
So I guess he actually came to school.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.510
What a pain.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:04.680
(To: Ahn In Dae Thanks for everything. Kang Min Hak)

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:05.820
Don't tell me...

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.490
this is actually happening!

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.520
Back to Heinrich's Law.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:16.889
For every major disaster,

00:34:16.890 --> 00:34:20.030
there are always small warning signs.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.700
How a series of small, absurd moments...

00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:25.870
can lead to one monumentally absurd one.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.100
The start of that error code...

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:31.240
Was it the moment our campus became an unwilling runway?

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.550
Wow, he's so handsome. Is he a new actor?

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:36.610
No, a part-timer.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.880
I just asked him to be a stand-in. We're good. Thanks!

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.290
Okay. Thank you.

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:46.090
Or maybe, at some point in the past that seemed safe,

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.119
the disaster had already begun.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.930
New vehicle entered. Redirecting.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:54.900
Excuse me. Hold on. Sir, you can't park here.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.670
What? There's a spot right here. Why are you telling me I can't park?

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.000
As you can see,

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.210
it's a handicapped spot. I'm sorry.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.710
- Come on, on a day like today... - I've got to record this jerk.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.540
- You need to be a little flexible. - Gosh, it died.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.510
- It's a handicapped parking spot... - So... Half air, half sound.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.520
What the? What was that noise?

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.520
Hey! Were you filming me?

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.390
What if I'm still filming? Whose manager are you, anyway?

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.490
Hey, Seung Gon, what's going on?

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.460
Hey. It's nothing. We're all good.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.860
Look, don't cause a scene. Just move the car, all right?

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.640
Excuse me.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.240
- Thanks for your help. - You don't work here, do you?

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:42.680
- Why are you even here? - I work the outdoor section,

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.480
but I was coming back from the restroom. So, yes, my bad.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:48.850
Don't apologise. The real problem is rude people thinking it's a one-off.

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:50.790
Next time, just give them the same attitude.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.720
A battery error.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.460
Wait, so earlier...

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.500
- Are you in college? - I'm starting this year. Still 19.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.830
Oh? Me too.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.640
I mean, me too.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.600
Eager to be friends, are you?

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.110
No, it's not like that.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.010
All right, then. What's your major?

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.310
I'm a modelling major.

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.150
Cool. I'm in CompSci.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.150
- I'm off. - Okay.

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:23.650
What?

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.020
KAIST? Wow, that's a top-tier school.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.790
Wow, you must be a genius.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.860
This? It was a gift from a senior in high school.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:35.400
Hold on. Just one second.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.800
What?

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.200
Yes, I'm coming. I'm on my way now. Okay.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.500
I don't go to KAIST, though.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.710
I'm starting at Hangang University.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.740
Not that you needed to know that.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.560
Come on, Joo Yeon San. For now, just focus on moving ahead.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.629
Then again, should I look back?

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:04.590
No, "moving forward" is the right idea.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:09.030
Not the cliche "look forward" way just because he's in front of me.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.940
Back when I didn't know who he was and his smile gave me butterflies,

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.410
that might've been the moment the real trouble started.
