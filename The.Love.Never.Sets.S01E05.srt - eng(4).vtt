00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.000
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.320
Can you open up and clear this up?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.920
You’re roommates but you only talk when you’re drunk?

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.160
I’ve been waiting all this time to see you again.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.240
You never stopped believing in me.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.120
I'm sorry.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.200
I forgive you.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.320
Do you want to rehearse the scene together?

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.320
Hello, my love.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.200
Did you miss me?

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.880
Warm?

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.880
Hello, my love.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.280
Did you miss me?

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.280
Warm?

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.080
How did you get here?

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.600
Why can't I want to know what my boyfriend is up to

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.600
or where he is?

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.239
Hmm?

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.880
Your room is pretty big.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.560
Where's your roommate?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.760
I don't know.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.280
We don't really talk.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.000
Look, there's even a territory line.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.080
Is that your bedroom?

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.160
Yes.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.280
Can I go in?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.840
Hey! Warm.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.440
Hey!

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.240
Warm.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.880
Wait.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.760
Warm!

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.360
Ice.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.920
Didn’t you say you see me as family?

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.000
Then why aren’t you happy to see me?

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.200
I was just surprised.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.680
You suddenly showed up out of nowhere.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.640
S A I N T

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.320
What’s that, Ice?

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.160
Saint?

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.760
Yeah, the same Saint I told you about.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.320
That Saint, Warm.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.320
Then why are his things in your room?

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.880
So who’s your roommate actually?

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.320
My roommate is Saint.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.880
What?

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.760
Didn’t you tell me

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.360
you hated him?

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.160
So why are you living with him?

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.440
I didn’t have a choice.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.960
It was the only room left.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.760
It’s just a coincidence.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.040
A coincidence, huh?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.280
A coincidence that

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.760
you’re even acting in the same movie?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.360
Huh?

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.880
Kit kisses Seen in the house,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.320
then they push each other with heated emotions

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.320
and end up in a dimly lit room.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.520
Are you acting for the movie,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.920
or are you acting to fool me, Ice?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.480
Is this how people who are dating behave, Ice?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.760
Warm…

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.480
I’m sorry, okay?

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.240
Please?

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.680
I’m hurt, Ice.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.680
That you’d do this to me.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.960
Didn’t you say you hated Saint so much?

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.560
That he pissed you off and

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.800
you didn’t even want to see him again?

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.200
So how can you believe him now?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.200
That he won’t leave you again?

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.159
For all we know, he might quit,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.000
and you’ll end up without a co-star,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.640
because his dad won’t let him act anymore.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.960
because his dad won’t let him act anymore.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.040
And Saint, he…

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.200
I’m jealous, Ice.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.480
That you have to kiss someone else.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.360
I’m scared.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.560
Scared that you’ll start to fall for him.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.040
If you leave me, what am I supposed to do?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.120
I’m here with you now, Warm.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.120
See?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.400
I haven’t gone anywhere.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.920
You see that, right?

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.000
I asked if you saw that?

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.440
Hey!

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.120
I’ve been waiting forever for

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.120
you to finally come out.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.000
But I forgot.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.840
you’re really good

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.960
at staying quiet.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.320
You gonna tell me

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.720
what you two were doing before this?

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.200
Why do you both smell like alcohol?

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.040
Warm.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.560
Don’t jump to conclusions.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.159
I just didn’t want you to know

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:37.200
that we were alone together.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.000
Wow, that makes me feel so much better, Ice.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.159
You said you kept your distance outside,

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.720
but then you two are alone together in a room?

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.560
Warm…

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.280
Now you know where I am

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.240
and who I’m with.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.760
I won’t hide anything from you anymore.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.000
Then you choose,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.280
come back to my place with me.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.800
Or stay here with him.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.720
Warm…

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.920
I’ll go back with you tonight.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.680
Good.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.480
Then

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.000
if you’ll excuse me,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.640
I’m taking my boyfriend back to our room.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.360
We’ll sit and talk

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.000
and do what couples normally do.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.560
Ice,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.000
Didn’t you say you’d make it up to me?

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.240
Yeah, I did, Warm.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.640
But right now, my stomach really hurts.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.160
Can I please go to the bathroom first?

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.120
Ice?

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.480
Ice?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.240
Ice?

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.440
Ow,

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.280
Warm, my stomach really hurts.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.200
You done yet?

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.080
Not yet, Warm.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.160
Do you have colon cancer or something?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.720
Not yet, Warm.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.320
I think I’ll take a shower too.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.160
Sorry, Warm.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.880
It’s just not the right time yet.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.280
You woke up and made porridge this early?

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.040
I was hungry.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.680
At six in the morning?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.880
Yeah.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.400
You want some?

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.120
Sure.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.720
Come sit and eat with me.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.360
About last night, I’m sorry.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.080
Why are you apologizing?

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.880
You didn’t do anything wrong,

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.720
you just brought your boyfriend here.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.720
That’s exactly why it’s wrong.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.120
If I hadn’t kept it from him,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.800
he wouldn’t have gotten that mad.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.240
Anyway, from now on,

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.840
if there’s ever something I do

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.200
that makes you or him uncomfortable,

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.920
just tell me, okay?

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.280
I’ll try to stay out of your way.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.640
Or…

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.400
If you two want to do something in this room,

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.520
I can leave too.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.520
I’ll just forget the rules set before.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.880
Are you being sarcastic right now?

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.440
No, I’m not.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.520
I’m just being a good roommate.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.160
Where are you going?

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.280
Aren’t you gonna eat?

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.640
Nah.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.480
I’ll go take a shower.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.240
About last night…

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.600
I just went back with Warm, that’s all.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.200
Nothing happened,

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.640
not like what you think.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.280
If you’re ready...

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.600
Action.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.680
Seen.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.560
Can I kiss you?

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.319
Don’t, Kit,

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.079
someone might see.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.800
I don’t want to lose you.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.520
Tell me you like me.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.160
I do.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.280
If you can say the line clearly,

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.079
you can go in for the kiss.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.080
Cut!

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.360
Let’s take fifteen minutes, everyone.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.800
Then we’ll continue the workshop.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.720
Ice, take a break,

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.080
clear your mind.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.360
I'll talk to Saint for a bit.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:57.920
Okay.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.000
Come here.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.240
You two were fine yesterday, weren’t you?

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.720
What happened?

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.440
I don’t know.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:22.920
Someone like you?

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.480
Not knowing what happened?

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.040
Just tell me straight.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.320
Otherwise, this workshop is really going to fall apart.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:33.680
Well…

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.680
I just don’t want to kiss someone

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.720
who already has a boyfriend.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.840
You mean…

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.160
Okay.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.600
We’ll talk about this later as friends,

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.640
after work.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.360
But right now, as your acting coach,

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.240
I need you to focus and get through this scene.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.840
Focus on being Kit and Seen,

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.440
not Saint and Ice.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.280
Why’d you come out?

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.520
You’re not comfortable acting?

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.960
You can tell me.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.240
No, it’s not that.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.760
It’s just…

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.560
We had a bit of an issue last night.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.280
So things are still awkward between us.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.400
Lanee told us to take a short break.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.720
If there’s something bothering you,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.000
you can talk to me.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.360
Let’s say… hypothetically,

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.640
if I didn’t tell my friend something,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.600
even though we were getting closer,

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.320
is that really bad?

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.440
Especially if what we didn’t tell him

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.440
ends up causing him trouble later on.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.320
That’s a complicated question.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:58.680
Oh,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.760
he means..

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.520
if Ice hid something from Saint

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.800
and it caused Saint trouble,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.760
would that make Ice a bad person?

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.440
No!

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.400
That’s not what I meant.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.480
I mean…

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.880
it’s about a friend of a friend.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.960
Well, I think it depends on

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.440
what kind of secret it is.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.400
Is it bad?

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.880
Yeah, it can be.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.040
Because some people

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.280
might feel like they don’t matter,

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.320
like they’re not trusted.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.760
But

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.280
I don’t think you’re that kind of person.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.080
If you mess up, apologize

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.000
and if you’re uneasy, talk about it.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.520
If you feel something, tell them.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.960
It helps you understand each other better.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.000
Okay.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.280
Thanks.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.800
Ice, you can come back in now.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.040
Fighting.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.960
I miss you.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.640
Hmm? I miss you?~

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.720
Miss you too.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
I’m going to work now. Bye-bye.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.840
Miss you.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.240
Miss you so much. What?

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.520
Go to work. Miss you.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.600
Get back to work.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.200
Okay.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.680
Miss you.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.280
If you’re ready, we can start.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.680
Seen.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.600
Can I kiss you?

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.200
Yeah.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.520
Saint.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.320
Look into my eyes.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.640
Don’t think about anything else,

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.960
just me.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.680
Imagine

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.080
if I didn’t have a boyfriend,

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.640
how would you kiss me then?

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.360
And if my heart

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.160
had only you,

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.320
and always only you,

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.200
you’re the only one I’d love,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.160
and the only one I’d ever kiss,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.880
then

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.440
would we kiss?

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.520
Could we finally kiss?

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.280
Okay, cut.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.720
That was amazing.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.760
Keep it just like that for the real take.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.080
Sea’s going to be so proud

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.080
that our actors are this good.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.760
So Ice really does have a boyfriend?

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.240
Warm, the senior in year four.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.600
In the end,

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.160
I could only kiss him in the scene.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.040
But honestly,

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.400
I don’t think Ice and Warm are right for each other.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.160
I don’t know if they are or aren’t.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.320
But Ice is kind of strange.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.880
He’s got a boyfriend

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.880
and didn’t tell anyone.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.920
Maybe he just wants to keep it private.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.040
You know

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.800
I’m the one who brought him back into my life.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.520
And we just made up,

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.520
so it’s not weird that he didn’t tell me.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.080
And what Ice said

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.080
that he's never had sex with Warm.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.760
Why would he mention that?

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.720
It's like he's giving you false hope.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.640
Sometimes I really wonder,

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.760
you doing all this for him.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.280
Has he ever done anything for you?

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.680
I never expected anything in return from Ice.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.400
Just being able to take care of him

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.640
in my own space,

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.840
that’s enough for me.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.000
So you’re just gonna let your guy

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.080
go off and be with someone else forever, huh?

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.280
Careful, being too good might

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.520
make him stop valuing you.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.960
You keep asking about me,

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.040
what about you and Prite?

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.640
You two on and off again?

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.320
I was never with Prite.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.160
We were just talking.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.160
And sleeping together, that’s all.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.880
You never think about being serious

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.040
with anyone, do you?

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.080
And who would I even be serious with?

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.840
Weren't you just upset

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.640
because he went to a concert with some girl?

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.080
I just…

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.560
He just asked me for concert tickets,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.680
so I gave them to him, that’s all.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.200
Hmm.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.360
What about you and Sea?

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.680
How’s that going?

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.800
As you can see,

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.240
we’ve gotten pretty close.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.320
How close exactly?

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.480
Let’s just say, very close.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.000
Good evening, everyone!

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.840
What song do you want me to sing?

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.280
Send your requests with shots!

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.400
Woohoo!

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.960
Can you sing Only You by Atlas?

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.800
You got it!

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.640
Uh.. Woohoo!

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.320
(I want to slowly love, love, love)

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.680
(but it caught me off guard)

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.600
(Tried to stop loving, loving, loving)

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.040
(but I just can’t) Don’t give in!

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.880
(My heart keeps saying every time, Only you)

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.680
Ahh, so cute!

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.440
(Can’t stop loving you every single day)

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.480
That was bold!

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.160
Anyone want to top that? Thank you!

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.200
I do!

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.440
Drink!

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.240
Woohoo!

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.120
I’ll give four thousand!

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.160
Oh! Woohoo!

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.840
Oh!

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.760
Cheers!

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.160
Drink up!

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.920
Enjoy!

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.520
Oh dear!

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.840
Wait, I’m coming, I’m coming! Gotta check him out.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.960
You okay?

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.080
Hmm?

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.280
Oh dear!

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.680
I’m fine.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.600
What’s up with you tonight?

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.840
Why are you accepting so many shots?

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.120
I just need money urgently for something.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.320
But thank you so much, really.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.960
No worries, whatever makes you comfortable.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.560
As long as my customers are happy, I’m happy too.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.560
You did great,

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.480
thank you, thank you!

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.720
Hello everyone,

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.800
I’m Warm Voice.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.280
And tonight, I’ve got something special to share.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.960
I actually wrote a new song. Speak of the devil.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.920
It’s still just a demo, not finished yet,

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.960
but I really think it’s beautiful,

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.160
so I wanted to play it for you all tonight.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.840
(Thank you for coming into )

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.920
(my life as a ray of sunshine,)

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.560
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.720
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:32.200
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.960
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:39.200
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:45.720
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.960
Thank you.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.400
You drank so little.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.360
Drink up!

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.760
See?

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.280
People who don't drink still end up drinking.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.480
How about a glass?

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.520
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:31.040
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.080
I'll be right back.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.880
Where are you going?

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.160
There's something I need to clear up with him.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.680
I'm going to leave now.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.680
Ok, get home safe.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.320
Yeah.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.040
You're so silly.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.120
No one will see.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.000
Bye, drive home safely.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.920
Bye bye. Bye.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.880
Tell me when you get home.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.240
Hey!

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.720
What did you just do?

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.320
Did you forget that you already have a boyfriend?

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.600
I was just sending my coworker home.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.440
Why?

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.720
Coworker?

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.080
What kind of coworker acts all secretive,

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.080
kissing each other on the cheek in the parking lot?

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.840
And what kind of roommate

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.400
likes to meddle in other people’s relationships?

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.480
Oh, wait..

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.640
calling you a roommate isn’t quite right, is it?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.040
Maybe I should call you a closetmate instead?

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.160
Shit.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.360
Don’t you think Ice would be hurt

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.880
having a boyfriend who acts like this?

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.760
Let me tell you something.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.520
You think Ice is cold

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.360
but if I just talk sweetly for a bit,

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.720
he’ll stop being mad.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.960
Oh,

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.640
so that’s what you’ve always thought, huh?

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.640
That’s your excuse for cheating?

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.000
You used Ice’s kindness

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.640
to take credit for his song?

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.680
What?

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.280
You think if Ice sang it, it would be popular?

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.160
That trashy person?

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.560
Don’t you dare look down on Ice!

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.120
I’m just telling the truth.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.240
What’s your problem?

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.800
I’m warning you,

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.200
stay out of my business!

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.320
Don’t think I don’t know

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.960
how you really feel about my boyfriend!

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.960
And if you want to tell Ice about this,

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.719
go ahead.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:12.639
But we’ll see if he still trusts someone

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:15.639
who once left him alone in his worst times.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.280
Hey!

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.520
What happened to you?

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:39.760
Come here, let me treat your wound.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.680
Since when did you start being so hot-headed

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.480
and getting into fights like this?

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.400
Because of you...

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.120
What did you say?

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.080
Nothing.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.280
Just talking nonsense.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.680
Saint,

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.600
you’re staring at me like that,

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.360
just say what’s on your mind.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.400
Ice,

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400
if one day

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.640
you found out your boyfriend wasn’t a good person,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.600
what would you do?

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.880
Not good how?

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.200
No time for me?

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.000
Doesn’t acknowledge me publicly?

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.800
Or..

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.600
stole my song without giving credit?

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.640
What if it’s worse than that?

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.720
Worse in what way?

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:07.920
Saint,

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.960
if there’s something you need to say, just tell me.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.720
Sometimes things might be more than they seem.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.720
Worse than that would mean cheating, you know.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.360
Why are you still defending him?

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.680
I’m not defending him.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.280
Maybe Warm has his reasons.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.560
You can think that if you want.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.560
But why don’t you find out for yourself

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.120
what reason he has for acting like that?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.200
Ice, what are you doing here?

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.280
I came to see you, why?

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.240
I can't?

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.240
You two should talk it out.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.120
I’ll wait outside.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.680
Who was that just now?

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:05.080
The lead actress in my new music video.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.960
We were just doing a workshop, that’s all.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.440
Workshop for your new single?

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:14.640
Yeah.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:17.880
Why?

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.840
You don’t believe me?

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.640
Didn’t you and Saint kiss because of work, too?

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.000
Right?

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.920
And besides,

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.800
would this count as proof?

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.280
That Tina and I kissed because of work?

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.120
Hmm?

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.640
Ice.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.520
We’re dating,

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.640
and you don’t even let me touch you half the time.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.400
Forget it.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.680
I don’t think we’ll get anywhere with this conversation.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.160
You should go home.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.280
I don’t want to fight with you, Ice.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.800
But if you want me to trust you,

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.880
why don’t you trust me too?

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.520
Huh?

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:37.920
How about this,

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.720
if you don’t trust me,

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.720
let’s share our GPS locations.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.800
GPS? Yeah.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.920
Why would we do that, Warm?

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.240
So we can be transparent with each other.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.720
You’ll know where I go,

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.160
and I’ll know where you go.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.640
Fair and square, right?

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.680
Done.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.560
Trust me, okay, Ice?

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:36.720
Ice?

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.440
Ice!

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:42.880
So?

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.600
Was I right?

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.960
Are you okay?

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.800
I’m fine.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:01.600
There’s nothing to say, really.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.440
You’re still lying to protect him, huh?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
After everything he’s done to you?

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.240
If you don’t want to confront him,

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.640
I’ll do it for you.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.520
He deserves another punch.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.640
What if I said

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.560
I don’t want you to get hurt?

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.520
What do you mean?

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.000
If you go after Warm,

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.760
you’ll get hurt.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.560
And

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.240
when I said it’s nothing,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.520
it’s because

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.480
I don’t feel hurt

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.040
and I don’t even care about Warm.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.840
I didn’t feel anything.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.200
Not even when I saw him kiss another girl.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.200
Saint, I mean it.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.680
You don’t have to get involved with Warm.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.160
I can handle it.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.680
What are you doing?

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.600
Erasing the boundary line.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.680
And are you feeling better after yesterday?

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.120
I told you I’m fine.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.760
I’m just wondering,

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.160
every time we argue,

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.640
why does Warm always make

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.200
it sound like it’s my fault?

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.480
But whatever.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.560
Anyway, thank you so much.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.240
I think

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.720
I need to stop seeing you in such a bad light.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.400
Then

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.280
I guess I’ll keep letting my face get punched up and bruised,

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.560
just in case it helps me win your heart.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.560
Hey Saint,

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.760
wait here for a sec.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.560
I’ll be right back.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.280
I know

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.240
I’ve made things hard for you lately.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.320
I broke your stuff too.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.520
So…

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.120
this is my apology gift.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.800
Why’d you buy the matching set?

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.040
You might not believe me,

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.440
but this was the cheapest one in the store.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.240
Hey,

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.680
don’t look at me like that.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.120
I really meant to get it for you.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.160
At first

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.520
I wanted to buy the same model you had,

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.880
but who knew

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.520
your pen costs tens of thousands per piece?

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.320
You didn’t have to do this.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.160
It’s expensive and it’s not even your fault.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.200
I had to.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.440
You’ve used that pen since high school, right?

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.520
You remember that?

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.800
Then take one for yourself too

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.720
so it’s not a loss.

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.720
Hello, Dad.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.240
You didn’t forget, right?

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:28.000
We have a dinner appointment tonight.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.440
You and Lanee are getting married.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.760
Me and Mrs. Jan have already planned everything.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.320
While you’re still in school,

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.440
we’ll just make it publicly official

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.000
so people can see

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.880
that your relationship is progressing.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.280
But Lanee and I are childhood friends.

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.840
We could never think of each other that way.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.520
That’s even better.

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.040
Me and my husband were friends too.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.880
Friends can turn into lovers, right?

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.880
Then you'd know each other so well already.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.680
Hmm?

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.760
Or..

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:13.080
do you two already have someone you like?

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.960
Well, since you don’t

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.560
we don’t see

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.960
any harm in Saint and Lanee dating.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.680
Right, Saint?

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.240
I know what kind of person Lanee is.

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.640
Mrs.Jan, you also know what kind of person Saint is.

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.760
So that we can both be at ease.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.400
knowing our children

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:45.040
won’t end up dating just anyone random.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.120
Mrs. Jan,

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.640
about the new film project

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.760
sponsored by TQB for the students.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:57.800
I was wondering

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.680
if we could change the lead actor.

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.360
Maybe pick someone who isn’t a porn star?

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.840
But I don’t think

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.120
there’s anything wrong with this project, Mr.Kom.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.120
Besides,

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.720
TQB already announced that

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.960
they’re ready to support

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.960
the dreams of all kinds of people.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.600
Uh..

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.720
or are you just uncomfortable because

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.720
he used to act in adult films?

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.520
I think it’s perfectly normal.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:38.200
Porn acting is still a profession, after all.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.720
Mrs. Jan.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.000
Change it, I don’t want Saint in this project.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.560
No,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.720
I think this pair is perfect.

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.040
And besides,

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.400
Lanee is the acting coach for this film too.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.080
It’s great!

00:48:55.080 --> 00:49:00.200
Saint and Lanee will get to spend more time together.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.280
From coworkers to creative partners,

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.520
and eventually, soulmates.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.000
If you say so, then fine by me.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.920
I’ll head back now.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.000
I really think

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.440
we need to do something more serious soon.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:46.960
I’m leaving.

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:57.800
Saint!

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.320
Where are you going, son?

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.160
Back to the dorm.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:09.920
Dorm?

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.040
I mean the condo.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.040
I’m going to keep working.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.320
I was just about to ask,

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.560
what happened to your face?

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.640
Got hit while practicing a fight scene.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.560
So dedicated, huh?

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.640
For that movie of yours.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.720
You told me

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.880
to take every job seriously, didn’t you?

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:29.840
Yeah, I did.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.440
Just hope

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.520
that’s all you’re doing, acting in a movie.

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.240
Not getting involved with him outside of it.

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.640
Right?

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.520
Yes, sir.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.600
Ice and I only talk about work.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.560
Well,

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.640
that matches what Professor Sara said.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.320
I’m glad you’re not lying to me.

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:04.760
Then stay here tonight.

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.320
Or is there something at the condo

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.680
that makes you want to go back so badly?

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.560
I’ll stay here.

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.600
Hmm.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.480
Check if

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.680
Saint’s been messaging anyone suspicious.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.120
No, sir.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.840
Everything looks normal.

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.200
Hmm.

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.720
Sea, what are you doing?

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:22.000
Sea.

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.440
I can explain.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.520
Explain what?

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:35.760
Explain that Lanee and Saint are qing mei zhu ma?

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.800
That term actually

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.760
just means close childhood friends.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.600
Close childhood friends?

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.560
Close childhood friends who are getting married?

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:49.520
Okay,

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.920
I get it.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.760
But let me ask you something, Lanee.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.880
if this story hadn’t gone public,

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.520
when were you planning to tell me?

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.160
The truth is,

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.480
our parents are forcing us to get married.

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.880
I swear,

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.520
I have no intention of marrying Saint.

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.840
If you really mean that,

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.680
can you refuse your parents?

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.680
Then why don’t we go tell them the truth,

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.840
about what we are?

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.000
You know,

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.480
you really remind me of my ex.

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:41.480
I’m not like her.

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.320
I believe

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.520
there’s always a solution to everything.

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.560
Please, just give me a little time.

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.000
Sure.

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:56.560
Take your time.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.400
But I’ll take mine too.

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.120
Because I don’t want to

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.400
let my feelings run ahead anymore.

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.160
Sea.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.200
I think from now on,

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.600
we should only talk about work.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.320
Going back to how things were before

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.600
is probably for the best.

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.920
Ugh, what should we eat?

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.480
Yeah, I’m craving bingsu.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.960
Oh, hi Lanee!

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:33.800
Here to see Sea?

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:34.760
No.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.360
She’s just here to talk about work.

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.240
She’s about to leave.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:42.960
Right?

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.400
Right.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.400
I was just about to go.

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.680
Do you think we’re wasting our time

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.920
sitting here waiting for Professor Mint?

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:11.320
Oh come on,

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.760
Mud!

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.120
You’re making me do this alone?

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.040
Wake up!

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.000
What?

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:20.440
I said,

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:21.960
are we wasting our time

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.480
doing something stupid right now?

00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.800
Did you forget why we’re here?

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.320
We’re here to defend justice!

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.200
To uncover the truth, punish the bad,

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.720
and protect the good!

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.040
I think what we’re doing isn’t nearly enough!

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.200
Fine, fine.

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.520
Hey, hey!

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:39.920
Professor Mint’s here! He's here?

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:40.640
Huh?

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.840
He’s right behind you, idiot.

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:43.640
Don’t turn around!

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.600
Wait?

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Why is Ice with Professor Mint?

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.200
I thought Ice hated him

00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.200
I have no idea.

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.160
But we need to

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.920
ask the expert about this.

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:53.760
Mr.Saint?

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:54.920
Where are you going?

00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.840
I’m heading out.

00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:58.600
You can’t, sir.

00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.840
Mr.Kom ordered it.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.840
Please don’t go against his wishes.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.920
Ice is in danger.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.240
If you try to stop me again this time,

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.240
if I have to use force,

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.280
I’ll do it.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.280
Ice is here!

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.600
Ice!

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.240
Are you hurt anywhere?

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.840
I want you to know,

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.600
I’ll always be by your side,

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.960
whether as a friend or whatever.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.760
This is Prite, he studies economics.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.720
Your name’s Mud, right?

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.800
Book talks about you often.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.080
Kiss! Kiss!

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.800
Woohoo!

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.280
Ice, me and Lanee..

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.800
What were you two doing?
