‎PREVIOUSLY ON ‎CHOSEN HOME

00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:06.644
Genichi Hatano, a man afraid of love

00:00:06.711 --> 00:00:08.646
after a comment made
by a marriage agency staff

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:09.681
begins to change.

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:11.783
Love and revolution.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.819
His love interest, Saku Sakuta,
is a middle school teacher.

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:16.020
Saku’s student,

00:00:16.087 --> 00:00:18.256
Hotaru Kusunoki,
shows up carrying 30 million yen.

00:00:18.323 --> 00:00:19.824
Party A’s mother, Tomoe Kusunoki,

00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:22.660
is wanted for embezzlement
from her company and is on the run.

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:24.996
-Not wanting to see Hotaru suffer,
-Please.

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:27.499
Genichi decides to pose as her father.
But…

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:28.700
I'm Jin Ichigaya.

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.735
Your stage name is Genichi Hatano?

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:33.404
…to the police,
he tells a lie far too big to sustain.

00:00:34.372 --> 00:00:35.773
-Hey.
-That lie is then

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.942
exposed instantly
when Hotaru's real dad appears.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:39.410
You’ve been lying all this time?

00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:41.146
And finally, a confession.

00:00:41.212 --> 00:00:42.514
I like you.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.015
Meanwhile, Hotaru’s mom

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:47.085
continues her runaway journey,
wandering across Japan.

00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:49.053
I won’t be coming home for a while.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.022
-I'll be back.
-Excuse me!

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:51.990
Yes?

00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:54.993
TAMOTSU’S LITTLE GIFT SHOP

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.294
The day before yesterday,

00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:57.795
or maybe the day before that,

00:00:57.862 --> 00:01:00.565
I think, I sent a letter to Tokyo.

00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:02.600
-Right.
-Has it arrived by any chance?

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.235
Did you send it out by mistake, perhaps?

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.671
Why do you ask?

00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:07.906
You sound like you wished
it wasn't sent out.

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:11.142
Ah, no…

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:12.677
I’m not sure.

00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:14.946
Maybe I did send it to the wrong place.

00:01:17.248 --> 00:01:19.584
I honestly don’t know myself too.

00:01:23.988 --> 00:01:24.989
I said…

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:28.026
I like you!

00:01:28.092 --> 00:01:29.093
Huh?

00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:30.895
Because I like you.

00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:32.330
Saying to use a house as a "clamp"

00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:34.299
and accompanying you to the viewing…

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.302
I did those things…

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:38.636
because…

00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:40.605
I like you.

00:01:42.407 --> 00:01:43.408
But more importantly…!

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:44.475
What's more important?

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:46.778
We’re talking about Hotaru.

00:01:46.844 --> 00:01:47.979
If exposed, you’ll be arrested.

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:48.980
Right.

00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:52.116
What if her biological dad
decides to report you?

00:01:52.183 --> 00:01:53.117
That’d be bad.

00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:56.521
You even lied to the police.

00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.557
You told Ms. Matsu
your name was Jin Ichigaya.

00:01:59.624 --> 00:02:02.360
That "Genichi Hatano" was a stage name
when you were aiming to be

00:02:02.427 --> 00:02:03.261
a musician and stuff.

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:04.996
-That part is true.
-What?

00:02:05.063 --> 00:02:07.131
I did aim to be a musician.

00:02:07.198 --> 00:02:09.233
That's beside the point!

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.403
Using a fake name is the real problem, no?

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.305
Pull yourself together!

00:02:14.806 --> 00:02:16.507
Are you still going to act as her parent?

00:02:16.574 --> 00:02:18.042
I already signed the contract.

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.877
Come on…

00:02:19.944 --> 00:02:22.146
What’s this? A strategy meeting?

00:02:22.647 --> 00:02:24.816
‎-Got you!
‎-Something like that.

00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:26.818
No, it’s not!

00:02:26.884 --> 00:02:29.487
He's definitely gonna show up again.

00:02:29.554 --> 00:02:31.823
-I’ll keep an eye out too.
-You're fine with this?

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.358
-Huh?
-You're his accomplice then.

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:34.392
You know…

00:02:34.892 --> 00:02:36.694
That's actually kinda cool!

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.130
What? Come on!

00:02:39.197 --> 00:02:41.599
-Okay.
-Your hand.

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:43.568
For Hotaru’s sake,

00:02:43.635 --> 00:02:45.837
we’re in this together!

00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:47.272
Y-Yeah…

00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:49.340
You need to be more enthusiastic!

00:02:49.907 --> 00:02:50.975
-One more time.
-Okay.

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:53.177
-For Hotaru’s sake,
-For Hotaru’s sake,

00:02:53.244 --> 00:02:55.647
-let's do this together!
-let's do this together.

00:02:55.713 --> 00:02:56.881
That’s different from just now.

00:02:56.948 --> 00:02:58.816
‎-"Let’s do this together."
‎-Again?

00:02:58.883 --> 00:03:01.319
‎-Say, "Let’s do this together."
‎-Yes, "Let’s do this together."

00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:02.220
TO HOTARU KUSUNOKI

00:03:02.287 --> 00:03:03.354
Let's do this together… Got it.

00:03:03.988 --> 00:03:06.724
Let's do this together!

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.994
-One last time. Now, hold this.
-This?

00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:11.996
-Give it your all.
-Yes.

00:03:12.063 --> 00:03:14.766
Let's do this together!

00:03:18.903 --> 00:03:20.505
Wait for me!

00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:28.613
MAY I ASK A QUESTION?

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.649
IF A COMPLETE STRANGER PRETENDS TO BE
A MINOR’S PARENT, IS THAT A CRIME?

00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:32.550
IN SOME CASES, THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED
A CRIMINAL OFFENSE

00:03:32.617 --> 00:03:33.451
YOU MAY BE CHARGED WITH FORGERY
VIOLATION OF THE CHILD WELFARE ACT

00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:34.485
YOUTH PROTECTION LAWS
THE MINOR OFFENSES ACT, ETC.

00:03:34.552 --> 00:03:35.953
POSSIBLE APPLICABLE OFFENSES ARE…

00:03:38.556 --> 00:03:39.724
Mr. Sakuta.

00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:40.858
One moment, please.

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:41.826
Yes?

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:45.630
What's the matter?

00:03:45.697 --> 00:03:47.498
That man’s been loitering around,
hasn’t he?

00:03:52.203 --> 00:03:53.638
Why are you here today?

00:03:53.705 --> 00:03:56.207
THIS IS THE REAR GATE. PLEASE USE
MAIN ENTRANCE. NO UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES

00:03:56.274 --> 00:03:58.810
To see my daughter. Is there an issue?

00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:01.279
Is this about the money?

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.948
She's definitely hiding it.

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.385
There’s no way my ex-wife
would embezzle money just for herself.

00:04:07.452 --> 00:04:08.853
She’s too much of a coward.

00:04:09.354 --> 00:04:10.655
If she really did it,

00:04:10.722 --> 00:04:12.423
then it had to be for Hotaru.

00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:14.959
So, do you know anything about it?

00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:16.361
No.

00:04:17.762 --> 00:04:20.164
What about that man, then?

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:23.735
The fool that's calling himself her dad.

00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:26.804
I found out on that day too

00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:28.406
that he’s not really her dad.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.714
Could it be

00:04:37.448 --> 00:04:38.850
you swing that way too?

00:04:40.618 --> 00:04:42.987
That guy is gay, right?

00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:45.323
So, I thought maybe
you're in on it with him.

00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:48.159
Are you going to report him then?

00:04:49.327 --> 00:04:50.928
No way.

00:04:51.896 --> 00:04:53.431
If he gets arrested,

00:04:53.931 --> 00:04:56.000
I have to take care of Hotaru then.

00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:57.668
Never in hell.

00:05:00.605 --> 00:05:01.539
So, you really…

00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:04.375
All you really care about
is the money, huh?

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:06.544
What else could there be?

00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:08.479
Then could you please stop coming here?

00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:10.548
Oh, come on. I'm her dad.

00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:12.650
She didn’t come to school today.

00:05:13.217 --> 00:05:14.252
Please leave.

00:05:20.158 --> 00:05:21.159
Thank you!

00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:22.193
PARFAIT

00:05:31.035 --> 00:05:32.637
-Mr. Hatano!
-Hello.

00:05:32.703 --> 00:05:33.771
THE SETTING SUN

00:05:33.838 --> 00:05:35.540
I love the parfaits here.

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:36.908
I come every now and then.

00:05:36.974 --> 00:05:38.042
SHOPS & REST HOUSE FOOD

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:39.110
Me too.

00:05:39.777 --> 00:05:41.412
It’s a treat to myself for doing well.

00:05:43.381 --> 00:05:44.782
Um, what's that?

00:05:47.952 --> 00:05:50.788
"Love and revolution"…

00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:52.557
I was wondering what it meant.

00:05:53.391 --> 00:05:55.860
The other day, I just randomly quoted

00:05:56.594 --> 00:05:58.429
from 10 Quotes That Touch Your Heart.

00:05:58.496 --> 00:06:00.631
It's a short video I came across,

00:06:00.698 --> 00:06:02.099
and I just said it to you as-is.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.534
I see now.

00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:06.737
At work, I tend to say things
just to look cool.

00:06:08.272 --> 00:06:09.507
Sorry about that.

00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:11.375
Don't worry about it.

00:06:11.876 --> 00:06:13.377
-That's why you're reading that?
-Yes.

00:06:13.444 --> 00:06:14.679
For my own learning.

00:06:14.745 --> 00:06:15.913
Right.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.782
Have you not read it?

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.785
I did a long time ago.

00:06:21.752 --> 00:06:22.854
What was it about again?

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:27.458
To put it simply,
it’s like fighting old morals.

00:06:28.526 --> 00:06:30.995
I get how the characters feel,

00:06:31.062 --> 00:06:32.663
but their actions make no sense.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.233
The heroine's "love and revolution"
basically means

00:06:35.299 --> 00:06:37.702
having a child with a married man

00:06:37.768 --> 00:06:39.637
and raising it herself.

00:06:40.505 --> 00:06:42.139
That’d make headlines these days.

00:06:42.206 --> 00:06:43.641
Right?

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.978
But…

00:06:47.945 --> 00:06:49.847
maybe that's just how things
are meant to be.

00:06:49.914 --> 00:06:53.150
Everyone has their own
"love and revolution", I guess?

00:06:54.418 --> 00:06:55.553
Really?

00:06:56.921 --> 00:06:59.924
How’s your "love and revolution" going,
Mr. Hatano? Any progress?

00:07:00.558 --> 00:07:03.594
-I guess so?
-What?

00:07:03.661 --> 00:07:04.762
I confessed my love.

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:05.763
Really?

00:07:07.098 --> 00:07:10.668
He doesn’t seem
all that interested, though.

00:07:10.735 --> 00:07:13.204
Then make him interested.

00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:14.305
How?

00:07:14.372 --> 00:07:16.107
Convince him it’s fate.

00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:21.746
We met at the agency,
then again at the park?

00:07:22.713 --> 00:07:24.348
That's all fate, right?

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.417
Wait, both of us?

00:07:27.118 --> 00:07:28.219
Something like that!

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.755
-Right.
-Yeah.

00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:36.594
Is that also some kind of quote
or something?

00:07:36.661 --> 00:07:37.495
Oh, no.

00:07:38.496 --> 00:07:41.198
This is from a book called
100 Foolproof Love Techniques.

00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:45.369
Don’t you think
the number of fences increased?

00:07:46.504 --> 00:07:47.538
Did it?

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:50.708
It used to only go this far.

00:07:51.776 --> 00:07:53.511
Now that you mention it…

00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:55.279
What if they keep adding more,

00:07:55.346 --> 00:07:57.481
and there's nowhere left for us to go?

00:07:57.548 --> 00:07:58.816
Even fill the roads with fences?

00:07:59.317 --> 00:08:00.818
Like all over the place.

00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:02.219
What do we do if we're surrounded?

00:08:03.588 --> 00:08:04.789
Coming.

00:08:06.057 --> 00:08:07.425
-What's wrong?
-Just for a bit.

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:10.161
Could it be your dad came again?

00:08:10.227 --> 00:08:12.496
Nope, he didn't.

00:08:12.563 --> 00:08:14.031
Then you must be hungry.

00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:15.433
Oh, before I forget.

00:08:19.337 --> 00:08:21.272
Here. A spare key.

00:08:22.073 --> 00:08:23.808
Just in case your dad shows up again.

00:08:24.508 --> 00:08:25.810
Or, you know,

00:08:25.876 --> 00:08:26.944
if you ever get hungry,

00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:29.380
feel free to grab anything
from the fridge.

00:08:33.918 --> 00:08:34.885
Then…

00:08:35.586 --> 00:08:37.788
I’ll water the plants in return.

00:08:38.923 --> 00:08:39.824
Thank you.

00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:46.998
Did Mr. Sakuta agree to help too?

00:08:47.064 --> 00:08:47.898
What?

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:50.201
You two talked about it yesterday, right?

00:08:51.002 --> 00:08:52.803
I didn’t say it outright,

00:08:53.304 --> 00:08:56.240
but I feel like Sakuta would understand.

00:08:58.142 --> 00:09:00.645
It's easier for me
if I think positively anyway.

00:09:01.946 --> 00:09:03.981
-Thinking positively, you say?
-Yeah.

00:09:06.384 --> 00:09:08.686
I’m starting the laundry first,

00:09:08.753 --> 00:09:10.588
so you'd have to wait
before dinner is ready.

00:09:11.622 --> 00:09:12.456
Okay.

00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:27.805
Yes?

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.243
Now? I'm doing laundry…

00:09:33.077 --> 00:09:33.911
Sorry about this.

00:09:34.745 --> 00:09:36.380
No, it's fine.

00:09:36.447 --> 00:09:38.382
Did her dad come by again, by any chance?

00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:39.950
No.

00:09:40.017 --> 00:09:42.319
He came to the school today.

00:09:42.386 --> 00:09:44.221
What happened then?

00:09:44.288 --> 00:09:47.491
-I told him Hotaru was absent and he left.
-Okay.

00:09:47.558 --> 00:09:49.727
She's his daughter, and yet that guy

00:09:50.227 --> 00:09:52.396
really doesn’t seem to care about her.

00:09:53.831 --> 00:09:55.833
If I were Hotaru, I’d probably
just, you know,

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.035
hate everything.

00:09:58.536 --> 00:10:00.237
Her mom’s gone somewhere,

00:10:00.304 --> 00:10:02.006
and her dad’s like that.

00:10:02.873 --> 00:10:03.808
But…

00:10:04.308 --> 00:10:06.844
when I was deceived into thinking
you were her dad…

00:10:06.911 --> 00:10:08.746
Sorry about that.

00:10:08.813 --> 00:10:10.181
To be frank,

00:10:10.247 --> 00:10:12.616
I did feel you were unreliable.

00:10:13.117 --> 00:10:14.418
Still, I was glad.

00:10:15.286 --> 00:10:18.189
That she had a dad
who was trying his best.

00:10:18.255 --> 00:10:20.157
I was really happy for her.

00:10:20.925 --> 00:10:23.494
So… Well, it may be wrong.

00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:25.362
No, it's wrong on all levels.

00:10:26.864 --> 00:10:28.299
But for the effort she's putting in,

00:10:28.365 --> 00:10:30.234
I'd like to respect it.

00:10:30.835 --> 00:10:31.836
Does that mean…

00:10:32.336 --> 00:10:34.071
I support you
in pretending to be her parent.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.341
Are you sure that's okay?

00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:41.078
-What?
-I mean, you're a teacher.

00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:42.546
If this gets exposed,

00:10:43.414 --> 00:10:44.882
wouldn't you be forced to resign?

00:10:45.983 --> 00:10:47.485
Well…

00:10:48.285 --> 00:10:49.487
I'm fine with that.

00:10:50.054 --> 00:10:51.956
I don't even like school to begin with.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.391
And yet you became a teacher?

00:10:54.458 --> 00:10:56.861
I wanted to be a teacher
who doesn’t like school.

00:10:56.927 --> 00:10:57.895
Wow.

00:10:58.763 --> 00:11:01.098
It's weird, right?

00:11:02.133 --> 00:11:04.335
No, being who you want to be

00:11:04.401 --> 00:11:05.236
is impressive.

00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:09.673
I hated school too.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.608
Hold up.

00:11:13.944 --> 00:11:15.780
-Isn’t this fate?
-Huh?

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.915
Fate.

00:11:18.415 --> 00:11:19.950
-What is?
-Never mind.

00:11:20.484 --> 00:11:22.586
It's nothing. Sorry.

00:11:23.721 --> 00:11:26.423
Anyway, the next strategy meeting.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.491
I'll be there.

00:11:27.558 --> 00:11:28.425
Okay.

00:11:31.128 --> 00:11:32.429
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:36.834
What's wrong?

00:11:57.188 --> 00:11:59.256
-Hey. Get in.
-What do you want?

00:11:59.924 --> 00:12:00.825
-Don't touch me.
-Huh?

00:12:00.891 --> 00:12:02.493
Sit tight.

00:12:03.527 --> 00:12:06.163
Wait, what? Huh?

00:12:07.832 --> 00:12:09.033
What in the world?!

00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:13.671
-It's a kidnapping! Call the police!
-Kidnapping?

00:12:13.737 --> 00:12:15.472
But it's her biological dad.

00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:16.807
Even if we call the police…

00:12:16.874 --> 00:12:18.542
I-Is that so?

00:12:18.609 --> 00:12:20.611
I'm not sure.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.881
What's that?

00:12:23.948 --> 00:12:25.182
A letter?

00:12:25.716 --> 00:12:27.518
-From Hotaru?
-Did she run away from home?

00:12:27.585 --> 00:12:28.686
"To Hotaru.

00:12:28.752 --> 00:12:30.688
Let's meet at Lakeside Café.

00:12:30.754 --> 00:12:31.755
Make sure

00:12:31.822 --> 00:12:33.924
to bring the money with you.

00:12:34.558 --> 00:12:35.459
From Tomoe Kusunoki."

00:12:35.526 --> 00:12:37.895
That's Hotaru's mom.

00:12:37.962 --> 00:12:39.697
Is it really her, though?

00:12:41.098 --> 00:12:42.800
Asking her to bring the money?

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.702
It could be the work of her dad.

00:12:44.768 --> 00:12:46.971
If that's the case,
then it's unforgivable!

00:12:47.037 --> 00:12:49.106
Hotaru thinks it's her mom, right?

00:12:49.173 --> 00:12:51.375
But I feel like she’d be able
to see through it.

00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:52.776
Ah, on the back.

00:12:52.843 --> 00:12:53.611
FROM HOTARU KUSUNOKI

00:12:55.412 --> 00:12:57.815
"So, I'll be taking the suitcase back.

00:12:58.782 --> 00:12:59.950
From Hotaru Kusunoki."

00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:01.619
Sorry, make way.

00:13:07.224 --> 00:13:08.525
It's gone…

00:13:12.563 --> 00:13:14.098
I can go on my own.

00:13:14.164 --> 00:13:16.533
It's okay. I'll take you there.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.102
To Lakeside Café.

00:13:18.168 --> 00:13:19.436
How did you know about it?

00:13:19.503 --> 00:13:21.038
I checked your mailbox.

00:13:21.105 --> 00:13:23.974
If she were to contact anyone,
it'd be you.

00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:27.044
I went ahead and read it.

00:13:27.111 --> 00:13:29.513
So, you did have the money
with you all along.

00:13:32.917 --> 00:13:34.551
MR. SAKUTA

00:14:30.174 --> 00:14:31.241
Oh, uh…

00:14:31.308 --> 00:14:32.943
-Sorry!
-No, I'm sorry!

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.545
I'm really sorry about this!

00:14:34.611 --> 00:14:37.081
-Wait, I thought this place was…
-I'm sorry!

00:14:37.147 --> 00:14:38.615
-Sorry.
-I'm really sorry!

00:14:38.682 --> 00:14:40.851
-What's wrong?
-I'm so sorry!

00:14:41.719 --> 00:14:44.688
If you just want the money,
why not just grab this and scram?

00:14:44.755 --> 00:14:46.490
After I drop you off.

00:14:46.557 --> 00:14:47.958
Do you want to see Mom?

00:14:48.492 --> 00:14:49.994
Of course not.

00:14:50.494 --> 00:14:51.495
Aren't you doing this for the money?

00:14:51.562 --> 00:14:54.765
-I am.
-Then I don't get this entire situation.

00:14:54.832 --> 00:14:57.601
They don't have a car, right?

00:14:57.668 --> 00:14:59.870
-Who, Mom?
-No.

00:15:01.071 --> 00:15:01.939
My current dad?

00:15:03.507 --> 00:15:06.377
Since you probably haven’t been
out anywhere, you're happy, right?

00:15:06.944 --> 00:15:10.147
Back when the three of us
used to go out together.

00:15:10.214 --> 00:15:11.882
Here, both of you can share these.

00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:12.983
Thank you!

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.285
We're not going out on a field trip.

00:15:15.352 --> 00:15:17.621
Oh, this is nostalgic!

00:15:17.688 --> 00:15:18.989
My parent's home always had this.

00:15:19.056 --> 00:15:22.059
Stuff like this
might disappear eventually.

00:15:22.126 --> 00:15:24.962
They stopped selling a lot
of these recently, right?

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:26.096
Enjoy it while you can.

00:15:26.797 --> 00:15:28.599
Thank you. We'll be off now.

00:15:28.665 --> 00:15:29.533
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:15:32.136 --> 00:15:34.238
Have a safe trip!

00:15:34.304 --> 00:15:35.406
These days,

00:15:35.472 --> 00:15:37.474
there’s been a lot of talk
about vacant houses.

00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:41.512
Our company is actually looking to expand
into that kind of business.

00:15:41.578 --> 00:15:43.847
Um, you'll be reporting me
to the police, right?

00:15:43.914 --> 00:15:44.748
The police?

00:15:45.516 --> 00:15:47.317
Ah, you did trespass.

00:15:48.118 --> 00:15:49.520
Well, yeah.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.155
You don’t have a home?

00:15:51.855 --> 00:15:53.223
It’s complicated.

00:15:54.324 --> 00:15:57.361
I'm really, really in a pinch.

00:15:57.428 --> 00:16:00.364
Please, I’m begging you…
Just don’t report me.

00:16:01.498 --> 00:16:03.667
Oh! I’ll give you this in return.

00:16:04.468 --> 00:16:06.336
Take whichever ones you like…

00:16:06.403 --> 00:16:08.138
Oh, I have oranges too.

00:16:08.205 --> 00:16:09.373
And this.

00:16:09.873 --> 00:16:12.176
You can take them all if you want.

00:16:12.242 --> 00:16:13.077
‎Yeah.

00:16:15.345 --> 00:16:16.547
Are you perhaps…

00:16:18.816 --> 00:16:19.950
a backpacker?

00:16:20.017 --> 00:16:21.018
What?

00:16:21.652 --> 00:16:24.922
So, you’re using this place
as a sort of lodging, huh?

00:16:25.656 --> 00:16:27.791
-Sorry about this.
-So, how was it living here?

00:16:28.625 --> 00:16:30.060
-What?
-Well…

00:16:30.127 --> 00:16:32.463
I'm asking because we’re about
to put it on the market.

00:16:32.529 --> 00:16:34.698
Is there anything you liked about it?

00:16:34.765 --> 00:16:37.701
Hmm…

00:16:37.768 --> 00:16:39.002
Nothing?

00:16:39.503 --> 00:16:40.838
Well…

00:16:44.775 --> 00:16:45.776
Oh, yes!

00:16:48.512 --> 00:16:50.614
You haven’t noticed, right?

00:16:51.748 --> 00:16:52.583
Sorry, what?

00:16:54.151 --> 00:16:55.152
Never mind.

00:16:55.219 --> 00:16:56.820
Here, take your pick.

00:17:03.727 --> 00:17:05.395
You've been using that car ever since?

00:17:06.396 --> 00:17:07.965
What's wrong with that?

00:17:10.167 --> 00:17:13.170
Mom said it’s a waste,
with just the three of us.

00:17:14.204 --> 00:17:15.372
Did she?

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:17.074
And then the argument started.

00:17:19.276 --> 00:17:20.377
Do you like that car?

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:24.982
The old commercial they did was awesome.

00:17:25.048 --> 00:17:26.617
The husband, wife, kids,

00:17:26.683 --> 00:17:29.186
grandparents, even a big dog,

00:17:29.253 --> 00:17:30.287
they all go to the beach.

00:17:30.354 --> 00:17:32.389
Seeing the whole family goofing around,

00:17:32.456 --> 00:17:34.491
the dad just casually
takes off his sunglasses

00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:36.260
and goes,

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.629
"This is a man’s happiness!

00:17:39.496 --> 00:17:41.698
A man’s car is this and whatnot."

00:17:43.567 --> 00:17:45.636
It was a wonderful ad.

00:17:46.436 --> 00:17:47.704
Want something to drink?

00:17:48.472 --> 00:17:50.107
I'll have some later.

00:17:50.174 --> 00:17:51.141
Okay.

00:17:56.813 --> 00:17:58.882
-How about some snacks?
-I said later!

00:17:58.949 --> 00:18:00.717
Oh, okay.

00:18:03.787 --> 00:18:06.423
Fine, I’ll take the jelly.

00:18:07.424 --> 00:18:08.325
Sure.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.963
I like these too.

00:18:15.265 --> 00:18:17.701
-Is this fate?
-Huh?

00:18:17.768 --> 00:18:19.436
Sorry. Forget what I said.

00:18:19.503 --> 00:18:20.637
Here you go.

00:18:21.138 --> 00:18:22.306
Thanks.

00:18:25.576 --> 00:18:27.244
-So, Hatano…
-Yes?

00:18:27.911 --> 00:18:29.213
How open are you about it?

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:31.715
You mean, coming out?

00:18:31.782 --> 00:18:32.950
Hotaru’s dad

00:18:33.016 --> 00:18:35.052
confronted me and asked,

00:18:35.118 --> 00:18:36.620
"You swing that way too?"

00:18:38.121 --> 00:18:41.124
That’s because he saw us together.
Sorry about that.

00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:43.260
Oh, no. I might’ve mentioned this before,

00:18:43.327 --> 00:18:45.462
but I don’t really hide it.

00:18:46.096 --> 00:18:49.333
I’m a bit careful at school,
since it'd be a hassle.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.003
But I was wondering
how you handle it, Hatano.

00:18:53.737 --> 00:18:56.907
Personally, my family back home knows,

00:18:56.974 --> 00:18:58.375
and my best friend…

00:18:58.442 --> 00:19:00.544
-The property agent?
-Yes.

00:19:00.611 --> 00:19:02.512
And lastly, Hotaru.

00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:04.348
That's about it.

00:19:04.848 --> 00:19:05.782
Well…

00:19:06.516 --> 00:19:09.152
If we’re talking about people
I’m close with, that is.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.856
I only tell those I trust.

00:19:13.357 --> 00:19:14.191
Okay.

00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:16.893
Oh, but Yoshida too.

00:19:18.462 --> 00:19:19.630
Along with…

00:19:19.696 --> 00:19:23.300
Hotaru's dad. It couldn't be helped.

00:19:28.238 --> 00:19:29.506
We’ve got time. Let's check it out.

00:19:29.573 --> 00:19:30.607
NO PLANS FOR DISCHARGE

00:19:30.674 --> 00:19:32.376
It says no water release today.

00:19:34.578 --> 00:19:35.746
Why does it have to be him?

00:19:35.812 --> 00:19:36.680
Huh?

00:19:38.348 --> 00:19:39.349
He's gay, right?

00:19:40.884 --> 00:19:42.619
You're one to talk.

00:19:45.555 --> 00:19:47.724
I realized I was gay
when I touched his beard.

00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:48.825
Really?

00:19:48.892 --> 00:19:50.560
He was my senior from middle school.

00:19:50.627 --> 00:19:53.730
When I looked closely,
I noticed he had hair under his chin.

00:19:53.797 --> 00:19:57.668
It was just a few,
but it was definitely there.

00:19:59.703 --> 00:20:01.438
When I got to touch it,

00:20:01.505 --> 00:20:03.373
strangely, my heart raced like crazy.

00:20:05.108 --> 00:20:07.611
That’s when I realized,
"Oh, so this is love."

00:20:08.812 --> 00:20:12.182
But that senior said he was going
to shave it immediately.

00:20:12.249 --> 00:20:14.017
So, before he did, I asked for a strand.

00:20:14.084 --> 00:20:14.918
You what?

00:20:14.985 --> 00:20:16.953
After that, I would put
that strand by my pillow

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.623
when I went to sleep.
I wrapped it in a tissue.

00:20:20.257 --> 00:20:23.293
But they thought it was trash
and threw it away.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.829
I was so sad.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.398
It was proof of my first love after all.

00:20:29.966 --> 00:20:33.503
Of course, I couldn’t confess
to him that I liked him.

00:20:34.037 --> 00:20:36.440
For me, that tiny hair

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.343
was the only proof that I loved someone.

00:20:41.545 --> 00:20:43.246
I cried my eyes out.

00:20:43.747 --> 00:20:46.416
I drove every adult around me nuts.

00:20:48.952 --> 00:20:50.987
When the strand was gone,

00:20:51.488 --> 00:20:55.158
it felt like the part of me
that loved him disappeared too.

00:20:55.992 --> 00:20:58.462
But if it was gone,

00:20:58.528 --> 00:21:00.197
that also means it existed.

00:21:01.832 --> 00:21:04.901
That strand of hair did exist.

00:21:06.903 --> 00:21:10.774
And so did that love.

00:21:12.542 --> 00:21:13.543
Yeah.

00:21:14.945 --> 00:21:17.147
What about you, Hatano? Your first love.

00:21:18.815 --> 00:21:21.985
There was this kid in middle school too

00:21:22.052 --> 00:21:23.954
that I really liked.

00:21:24.988 --> 00:21:26.323
I was the same as you.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.892
Couldn’t confess, of course,

00:21:28.959 --> 00:21:31.228
but we got close as friends.

00:21:31.294 --> 00:21:34.398
His name is written as "carp"
and "ascend", pronounced as "Koito".

00:21:35.132 --> 00:21:36.500
That's a cute name.

00:21:36.566 --> 00:21:37.734
I know, right?

00:21:38.702 --> 00:21:42.339
We were always together.
In fact, so much so,

00:21:42.406 --> 00:21:44.708
we were teased by our classmates.

00:21:44.775 --> 00:21:46.710
"I bet you guys are gay!"

00:21:46.777 --> 00:21:49.846
I got scared of being found out.

00:21:50.347 --> 00:21:51.648
I get how you feel.

00:21:52.816 --> 00:21:55.852
So, I joined in and teased Koito about it.

00:21:56.353 --> 00:21:57.421
That was how we ended.

00:21:58.522 --> 00:21:59.856
Oh…

00:21:59.923 --> 00:22:02.325
I hurt the person I loved

00:22:03.427 --> 00:22:04.461
and ran away.

00:22:04.528 --> 00:22:07.964
My first love and my best friend…

00:22:08.498 --> 00:22:11.301
I lost both at once.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.840
But the fact they’re gone

00:22:18.074 --> 00:22:20.243
means they did exist…

00:22:23.713 --> 00:22:24.748
At the very least,

00:22:24.815 --> 00:22:27.384
that’s what I want to believe.

00:22:31.621 --> 00:22:33.256
One thing I liked…

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.793
There’s a kamidana here.

00:22:38.094 --> 00:22:40.464
I never felt lonely,

00:22:40.964 --> 00:22:43.066
even spending a week alone
in such a big house.

00:22:43.133 --> 00:22:46.169
I guess it’s because of this.

00:22:46.236 --> 00:22:48.171
Well noted.

00:22:49.072 --> 00:22:50.874
The house I used to live in had one too.

00:22:51.441 --> 00:22:53.977
Every morning,
I’d pray with my grandmother.

00:22:54.044 --> 00:22:56.146
But when she passed away,

00:22:56.213 --> 00:22:58.248
the kamidana was thrown out.

00:22:58.315 --> 00:23:00.784
That's the norm these days.

00:23:00.851 --> 00:23:01.751
Back then,

00:23:01.818 --> 00:23:04.287
the security and safety
people used to pray to the gods for

00:23:04.354 --> 00:23:06.723
can now be bought with insurance.

00:23:08.258 --> 00:23:09.526
It's becoming less common.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.127
Kamidana, that is.

00:23:11.628 --> 00:23:14.798
So, they’ll just keep disappearing?

00:23:14.865 --> 00:23:18.201
Better burn it into my memory while I can.

00:23:19.536 --> 00:23:20.704
Let’s do that.

00:23:41.024 --> 00:23:42.025
Take this!

00:23:42.726 --> 00:23:43.527
What do you want?

00:23:45.095 --> 00:23:46.796
I'm so sorry!

00:23:46.863 --> 00:23:48.565
I didn't know you’re with the police.

00:23:48.632 --> 00:23:51.801
Good to see you’re security-conscious.

00:23:52.402 --> 00:23:53.236
Today, you're here for?

00:23:53.303 --> 00:23:56.640
The other day, together
with Hotaru Kusunoki and her dad,

00:23:56.706 --> 00:23:58.441
we had a session.

00:23:59.109 --> 00:24:00.577
Her dad?

00:24:00.644 --> 00:24:03.246
Yes, uh… Mr. Jin Ichigaya.

00:24:04.481 --> 00:24:06.683
His stage name is Genichi Hatano?

00:24:09.486 --> 00:24:11.755
He said he had pursued
a career as a musician.

00:24:12.722 --> 00:24:14.057
What is he like?

00:24:14.991 --> 00:24:16.092
What do you mean?

00:24:17.627 --> 00:24:19.429
He's unusual, isn't he?

00:24:19.496 --> 00:24:20.330
Oh, no.

00:24:20.397 --> 00:24:24.000
He really comes across as a good dad.

00:24:24.067 --> 00:24:25.402
Is that right?

00:24:28.939 --> 00:24:29.906
Oops.

00:24:35.912 --> 00:24:38.014
Have you heard him sing?

00:24:38.081 --> 00:24:39.616
Mr. Hatano’s songs.

00:24:40.717 --> 00:24:42.619
Oh, yes.

00:24:42.686 --> 00:24:44.120
What kind of songs does he sing?

00:24:44.187 --> 00:24:46.389
About not having a home,
or something like that.

00:24:46.456 --> 00:24:47.457
Does he not have a home?

00:24:47.524 --> 00:24:49.426
Uh, well…

00:24:49.926 --> 00:24:51.394
He does have a home.

00:24:51.895 --> 00:24:53.797
He lives with Hotaru, after all.

00:24:54.397 --> 00:24:55.865
Is it a dark song?

00:24:57.334 --> 00:24:58.268
No,

00:24:58.335 --> 00:25:00.704
it's more on the passionate side, I’d say.

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:05.308
-I see.
-Is there a problem?

00:25:05.375 --> 00:25:07.210
No, I was just curious.

00:25:07.277 --> 00:25:08.278
Okay.

00:25:09.212 --> 00:25:10.046
That's good.

00:25:11.014 --> 00:25:11.848
What's good?

00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:14.451
Ah, no, it’s nothing.

00:25:14.517 --> 00:25:15.585
Really nothing.

00:25:16.086 --> 00:25:17.721
Welcome!

00:25:17.787 --> 00:25:21.091
We'll have two sets of dam curry.

00:25:21.157 --> 00:25:22.125
Okay, two sets.

00:25:22.192 --> 00:25:23.827
-That'd be 2,000 ye--
-What about Mom's?

00:25:24.327 --> 00:25:25.962
-What?
-Mom's portion.

00:25:28.598 --> 00:25:30.567
Make it three sets of dam curry.

00:25:30.634 --> 00:25:32.869
Doesn't it feel nostalgic?

00:25:32.936 --> 00:25:35.005
The three of us went out
on drives together.

00:25:35.071 --> 00:25:37.607
Until I got carsick, threw up,
and got yelled at.

00:25:38.842 --> 00:25:39.776
But oh.

00:25:39.843 --> 00:25:42.479
The dam release!
It was so impressive that you--

00:25:42.545 --> 00:25:43.747
I was so scared, I cried.

00:25:43.813 --> 00:25:44.848
The dam curry.

00:25:44.914 --> 00:25:46.449
You were saying how good it was!

00:25:46.516 --> 00:25:49.552
I got grumpy midway
and went back to the car early.

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:52.522
You and Mom ate the leftover curry
and got so stuffed.

00:25:54.557 --> 00:25:56.926
Why do you only remember those parts?

00:25:59.029 --> 00:26:00.964
What about today? Are you having fun?

00:26:02.699 --> 00:26:04.100
Were you trying to make it fun?

00:26:05.001 --> 00:26:06.002
I'm better, right?

00:26:12.275 --> 00:26:15.011
I handle things like a dad better, right?

00:26:15.845 --> 00:26:18.014
I thought you didn’t
want to take care of me.

00:26:19.182 --> 00:26:20.150
You're right.

00:26:20.216 --> 00:26:21.451
So, why?

00:26:21.518 --> 00:26:23.119
I don’t get you, seriously.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.624
But if I don’t do better than him,

00:26:27.691 --> 00:26:29.459
I would lose, and that's just not right.

00:26:29.526 --> 00:26:31.094
What are you competing for?

00:26:35.265 --> 00:26:36.866
You’ve got a new family now,

00:26:36.933 --> 00:26:38.968
so just go and be their dad.

00:26:40.904 --> 00:26:43.273
That’s long gone.

00:26:44.174 --> 00:26:45.608
We divorced.

00:26:45.675 --> 00:26:48.511
I lost everything and am totally broke.

00:26:52.615 --> 00:26:53.850
What an idiot.

00:26:56.152 --> 00:26:57.587
You’re the idiot here!

00:26:58.254 --> 00:27:00.090
I'm the one who wrote that letter.

00:27:01.925 --> 00:27:04.094
Sorry for the wait!

00:27:07.297 --> 00:27:09.332
Just hand it over!

00:27:16.873 --> 00:27:19.743
DAM CURRY

00:27:24.581 --> 00:27:26.382
What the hell are you doing here?

00:27:26.449 --> 00:27:27.817
Please give that back!

00:27:27.884 --> 00:27:28.818
It’s not yours!

00:27:28.885 --> 00:27:30.153
It’s hers!

00:27:30.653 --> 00:27:32.021
Even the teacher is here?

00:27:32.088 --> 00:27:33.690
Stop giving me more work!

00:27:33.757 --> 00:27:35.191
Let go!

00:27:35.258 --> 00:27:36.559
Sakuta!

00:27:36.626 --> 00:27:38.128
Please give us three sets of dam curry!

00:27:38.194 --> 00:27:39.229
Three? Got it.

00:27:39.295 --> 00:27:41.798
-I'm hungry!
-I know, since we walked a lot!

00:27:41.865 --> 00:27:44.300
-I can't wait to eat!
-You're really hungry, huh?

00:27:44.367 --> 00:27:46.035
You love curry.

00:27:46.102 --> 00:27:47.470
Dam curry for everyone!

00:27:47.537 --> 00:27:48.605
Where are you running to?

00:27:50.373 --> 00:27:51.474
A slope?

00:27:59.215 --> 00:28:00.350
Wait!

00:28:06.156 --> 00:28:07.223
Let go of me!

00:28:09.793 --> 00:28:10.660
Got it!

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.698
-This is my money!
-You're wrong.

00:28:16.666 --> 00:28:18.234
It's embezzled money!

00:28:18.301 --> 00:28:21.104
Which means it’s not yours either!

00:28:21.604 --> 00:28:24.374
Hey, Sakuta! Saku-- Huh?

00:28:26.042 --> 00:28:26.943
What's going on?

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:28.745
-Dang it!
-That letter

00:28:28.812 --> 00:28:30.747
was written by you, wasn't it?

00:28:30.814 --> 00:28:31.915
Such a horrible lie!

00:28:32.482 --> 00:28:35.819
You lied too, saying the money
was not with you!

00:28:35.885 --> 00:28:38.888
Are you really that desperate for money?

00:28:38.955 --> 00:28:40.390
I’m going to start all over!

00:28:40.456 --> 00:28:41.357
What?

00:28:41.958 --> 00:28:43.426
A completely different life!

00:28:43.927 --> 00:28:45.128
What do you mean by that?

00:28:45.195 --> 00:28:46.496
Different means different, duh!

00:28:46.563 --> 00:28:47.664
Huh?

00:28:48.164 --> 00:28:50.099
Anyway, just different, you idiot!

00:28:50.934 --> 00:28:53.236
-I don’t understand what you’re saying!
-Damn it!

00:28:54.737 --> 00:28:56.105
What does a gay guy even know?

00:28:58.942 --> 00:29:00.677
You can’t even have kids!

00:29:02.645 --> 00:29:05.682
Why would Hotaru want someone like you?

00:29:05.748 --> 00:29:07.550
Why does she want a gay guy?

00:29:07.617 --> 00:29:09.018
Meanwhile, I'm normal.

00:29:09.953 --> 00:29:11.421
And she's my daughter!

00:29:12.488 --> 00:29:15.525
And yet I can’t even be a proper dad!

00:29:15.592 --> 00:29:17.360
Why can’t I be a man?

00:29:17.427 --> 00:29:18.728
It's always like this! Always!

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.332
-What, got a problem?
-No.

00:29:22.398 --> 00:29:23.132
What is it?

00:29:24.167 --> 00:29:25.268
What's your deal? Move it!

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:28.371
Sakuta!

00:29:30.907 --> 00:29:32.575
Okay, nicely done.

00:29:41.584 --> 00:29:42.452
Oh, come on!

00:29:50.226 --> 00:29:51.361
Sakuta!

00:29:52.095 --> 00:29:55.031
Sorry, but I'm leaving the rest to you!

00:29:55.565 --> 00:29:56.532
W… Wait…

00:30:00.136 --> 00:30:01.471
This can't be happening…

00:30:02.205 --> 00:30:03.439
It's coming. Just wait.

00:30:03.506 --> 00:30:06.709
-Here you go. Sorry for the wait!
-It's here.

00:30:06.776 --> 00:30:08.411
This is the dam curry.

00:30:08.478 --> 00:30:10.647
-It really does look like a dam.
-It looks yummy!

00:30:10.713 --> 00:30:12.582
-Wow!
-Thank you.

00:30:12.649 --> 00:30:13.883
Kusunoki…

00:30:14.617 --> 00:30:15.818
Hotaru!

00:30:16.319 --> 00:30:17.453
Mr. Sakuta.

00:30:19.756 --> 00:30:22.191
-Why are you here?
-I came with your dad.

00:30:23.826 --> 00:30:25.929
Hatano, I meant.

00:30:25.995 --> 00:30:26.896
Uh-huh.

00:30:28.364 --> 00:30:29.399
Um…

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.503
-Your mom…
-She won't be coming, right?

00:30:34.003 --> 00:30:34.837
I know.

00:30:39.208 --> 00:30:40.376
You may eat it.

00:30:42.979 --> 00:30:44.280
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

00:30:48.618 --> 00:30:49.519
Here.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.759
-I'm digging in.
-Likewise.

00:30:57.894 --> 00:30:59.963
Let's dig in!

00:31:02.598 --> 00:31:04.300
Oh, it's so cool!

00:31:04.367 --> 00:31:06.035
-It really is!
-Wow.

00:31:06.102 --> 00:31:07.303
Amazing!

00:31:08.071 --> 00:31:10.440
-That's a big piece.
-Can you eat it?

00:31:10.506 --> 00:31:12.809
Am I… eating this the right way?

00:31:20.984 --> 00:31:22.785
He’s a terrible dad.

00:31:26.756 --> 00:31:28.758
There are so many bad memories.

00:31:31.527 --> 00:31:34.263
But there were also memorable ones.

00:31:41.371 --> 00:31:43.039
They’re all gone now.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.376
I can't even get to see Mom.

00:31:50.013 --> 00:31:51.381
Everything’s gone.

00:31:56.052 --> 00:31:58.021
If it’s gone…

00:32:00.123 --> 00:32:01.691
that means it once existed.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.461
Well…

00:32:06.562 --> 00:32:08.297
That's what Hatano said.

00:32:12.268 --> 00:32:13.202
Right.

00:32:32.622 --> 00:32:35.725
Thank you for today.

00:32:35.792 --> 00:32:36.692
Don't worry about it.

00:32:36.759 --> 00:32:38.494
I got this in return, so…

00:32:38.561 --> 00:32:40.663
You’re really kind.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.265
You're giving me too much credit.

00:32:42.331 --> 00:32:43.533
Thank you.

00:32:43.599 --> 00:32:46.736
Honestly, it’s just that reporting you
to the police would be a huge hassle.

00:32:46.803 --> 00:32:50.006
Besides, I find backpackers
kinda interesting.

00:32:51.641 --> 00:32:54.811
For a long time,
I couldn’t really go anywhere.

00:32:54.877 --> 00:32:56.245
I was living in Tokyo,

00:32:56.312 --> 00:32:59.582
and I'd just go see the nearby dam.
I've been living that kind of life.

00:33:00.583 --> 00:33:02.585
And, well, it was fine, but…

00:33:05.922 --> 00:33:07.657
Never mind. Forget what I said.

00:33:07.723 --> 00:33:08.891
Enjoy yourself.

00:33:08.958 --> 00:33:10.660
And good luck finding a place to stay!

00:33:11.394 --> 00:33:13.196
-Thank you.
-Well then.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:21.304
Thank you for having me.

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:22.271
No, not at all.

00:33:22.338 --> 00:33:24.307
-I’ll come again.
-To listen to his songs?

00:33:24.373 --> 00:33:25.241
Yes.

00:33:25.975 --> 00:33:28.044
No, to check on things.

00:33:28.678 --> 00:33:29.779
See you.

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:31.414
I'll take my leave.

00:33:35.785 --> 00:33:37.553
Are you sure I can
have them all to myself?

00:33:38.788 --> 00:33:40.123
Yeah, no need to hesitate.

00:33:45.561 --> 00:33:46.863
Where's my dad?

00:33:48.564 --> 00:33:49.732
Which one?

00:33:51.567 --> 00:33:53.035
Both.

00:33:53.736 --> 00:33:55.004
I spilled a bit.

00:33:56.005 --> 00:33:57.306
It's fine.

00:33:57.974 --> 00:33:59.275
Sorry.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:04.013
You good for the restroom?
Need me to stop at a roadside station?

00:34:04.514 --> 00:34:05.982
I'm good.

00:34:06.949 --> 00:34:10.419
You can't do this. I said no.

00:34:10.486 --> 00:34:13.089
Ouch! You're hurting me!

00:34:13.156 --> 00:34:14.991
What are you doing?

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.394
Damn it!

00:34:32.308 --> 00:34:33.142
‎INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:34:37.013 --> 00:34:38.347
Were you okay?

00:34:40.716 --> 00:34:42.218
Where's Hatano?

00:34:42.285 --> 00:34:43.886
He went to retrieve the suitcase.

00:34:43.953 --> 00:34:45.188
He left the rest to me, he said.

00:34:45.254 --> 00:34:46.923
What? Will he be okay?

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:49.158
He really didn't have to go

00:34:49.225 --> 00:34:51.294
that far for just a suitcase.

00:34:54.697 --> 00:34:55.965
Wait, what did you just say?

00:34:57.833 --> 00:34:58.668
Huh?

00:35:02.104 --> 00:35:03.506
Hey!

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.474
-Hey, um…
-Sorry.

00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:07.543
What… Come on!

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:08.711
I'm really sorry, but…

00:35:08.778 --> 00:35:10.012
-Will you get off?
-No, sorry.

00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:12.148
Hey!

00:35:12.682 --> 00:35:13.516
-Get off--
-No.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.984
The money…

00:35:15.551 --> 00:35:17.153
What are you going to do with it?

00:35:18.487 --> 00:35:19.522
What?

00:35:21.057 --> 00:35:22.625
What do you want?

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.494
A house, maybe?

00:35:25.561 --> 00:35:26.495
Why a house?

00:35:26.562 --> 00:35:27.697
Buying a house

00:35:28.397 --> 00:35:30.566
and using it as a "clamp"
is my personal goal.

00:35:31.133 --> 00:35:32.835
A "clamp"?

00:35:32.902 --> 00:35:36.305
That's "love and revolution".

00:35:36.372 --> 00:35:37.873
You're creeping me out.

00:35:38.841 --> 00:35:39.809
Huh?

00:35:41.377 --> 00:35:43.679
Are you sure we can just enter?

00:35:43.746 --> 00:35:44.914
Yeah.

00:35:45.982 --> 00:35:46.949
It should be fine.

00:35:48.684 --> 00:35:50.319
Please excuse me.

00:36:02.465 --> 00:36:05.401
We're already in Tokyo!
Just get off already!

00:36:05.468 --> 00:36:06.736
Never!

00:36:06.802 --> 00:36:08.604
Not until I bring this back with me.

00:36:08.671 --> 00:36:10.473
This is something precious to her!

00:36:15.011 --> 00:36:15.945
What?

00:36:16.012 --> 00:36:17.046
Huh?

00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:20.416
So, you knew?

00:36:20.483 --> 00:36:23.286
The letter wasn’t from your mom.

00:36:23.352 --> 00:36:25.187
It doesn’t even look like her handwriting.

00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:29.058
I wonder who’s really the idiot here.

00:36:29.792 --> 00:36:31.794
But you went anyway.

00:36:31.861 --> 00:36:33.763
I just thought about thinking positively.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:35.431
Thinking positively?

00:36:35.498 --> 00:36:37.099
Maybe,

00:36:37.166 --> 00:36:38.634
just maybe,

00:36:38.701 --> 00:36:40.503
Mom will come.

00:36:40.569 --> 00:36:41.904
Maybe I’ll get to see her.

00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:43.139
So, that's how it is.

00:36:43.205 --> 00:36:44.040
Yeah.

00:36:51.247 --> 00:36:52.415
Do you wanna go for a walk?

00:36:53.149 --> 00:36:55.284
Did it not get to go out for a walk?

00:36:55.885 --> 00:36:57.653
Probably…

00:37:17.239 --> 00:37:18.607
You did it because you were asked to?

00:37:19.608 --> 00:37:20.910
Yes.

00:37:20.976 --> 00:37:22.011
To act as her parent?

00:37:22.078 --> 00:37:23.813
You must have a screw loose.

00:37:23.879 --> 00:37:25.948
I just want to do what I can right now.

00:37:26.515 --> 00:37:27.583
Huh?

00:37:29.251 --> 00:37:30.386
You said

00:37:30.453 --> 00:37:32.388
you can't be a proper dad.

00:37:33.222 --> 00:37:36.292
Well, I’ve got a lot I can’t do too.

00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:38.794
To begin with, I’ve failed at more things

00:37:38.861 --> 00:37:41.230
than most people. That's what I feel.

00:37:42.131 --> 00:37:45.401
So, all I can do is what I'm able
to do every day.

00:37:47.536 --> 00:37:48.637
And what do you know?

00:37:49.138 --> 00:37:51.907
Things somehow turn out alright.

00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:54.443
How so?

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:55.344
How should I put it?

00:37:56.145 --> 00:37:57.313
It's like being alive…

00:37:58.647 --> 00:37:59.849
feels good.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:01.784
What are the things

00:38:02.351 --> 00:38:03.419
you're able to do?

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.622
Like walking the dog every day.

00:38:06.689 --> 00:38:08.157
Do they perhaps remember the route?

00:38:08.224 --> 00:38:09.792
-Hello!
-Hello!

00:38:09.859 --> 00:38:10.726
Smiling and greeting.

00:38:10.793 --> 00:38:11.694
Hello.

00:38:11.761 --> 00:38:14.497
-The dogs are so cute!
-Go ahead.

00:38:14.563 --> 00:38:16.732
Giving way to others.

00:38:20.269 --> 00:38:21.203
A grasshopper.

00:38:22.171 --> 00:38:23.939
Releasing a bug back into the wild.

00:38:25.007 --> 00:38:26.809
Huh? A bug?

00:38:26.876 --> 00:38:29.278
It doesn’t have to be anything big.

00:38:29.779 --> 00:38:31.213
Just stick to what you can handle.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.916
I recommend it. Little by little,
that’s how you do it.

00:38:33.983 --> 00:38:35.084
What?

00:38:35.151 --> 00:38:36.485
Everyone has their own

00:38:37.153 --> 00:38:38.554
"love and revolution", I guess.

00:38:39.655 --> 00:38:41.123
What does that even mean?

00:38:44.393 --> 00:38:46.061
Even for a person like me,

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:48.697
is there anything I can do?

00:38:49.765 --> 00:38:50.599
Of course!

00:38:50.666 --> 00:38:52.067
Will being alive

00:38:53.235 --> 00:38:54.069
feel good?

00:38:54.737 --> 00:38:56.772
Yeah, totally!

00:39:00.242 --> 00:39:01.811
Don’t make it sound so easy!

00:39:08.651 --> 00:39:10.052
Ah, wait… Hey!

00:39:25.534 --> 00:39:26.669
Hello!

00:39:30.706 --> 00:39:32.174
Okay, here.

00:39:33.008 --> 00:39:34.743
Here you go.

00:39:35.578 --> 00:39:38.113
-This is a souvenir from my business trip.
-Thank you.

00:39:39.114 --> 00:39:41.283
I got this as a gift,
but share it with Genichi.

00:39:42.384 --> 00:39:45.120
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:39:45.187 --> 00:39:46.355
Welcome back!

00:39:46.856 --> 00:39:49.158
-Welcome back!
-I'm back.

00:39:49.225 --> 00:39:50.092
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:51.126
You walked the dogs?

00:39:51.193 --> 00:39:52.561
They asked us to.

00:39:52.628 --> 00:39:53.963
Thanks.

00:39:54.029 --> 00:39:55.397
He returned the suitcase?

00:39:55.464 --> 00:39:56.599
Look,

00:39:57.266 --> 00:39:59.802
could you please let me know
what's inside beforehand?

00:39:59.869 --> 00:40:01.437
It was exhausting.

00:40:02.238 --> 00:40:04.573
That's why I said I'm taking the suitcase.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.308
Didn't I?

00:40:06.375 --> 00:40:07.776
Is that what you meant?

00:40:08.777 --> 00:40:10.513
How'd you expect me to get it?

00:40:13.115 --> 00:40:14.683
Sorry you had to take them out.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.085
Oh, it's okay.

00:40:18.821 --> 00:40:20.623
There's a grasshopper on your foot.

00:40:23.325 --> 00:40:25.027
It must've followed me from earlier.

00:40:25.094 --> 00:40:26.028
What?

00:40:26.095 --> 00:40:28.731
It was about to get stepped on,
so I let it back into the grass.

00:40:32.735 --> 00:40:34.770
You have a grasshopper on you too.

00:40:41.443 --> 00:40:42.912
Isn't this fate?

00:40:46.482 --> 00:40:48.183
Yeah, it's fate.

00:40:50.419 --> 00:40:51.320
Huh?

00:40:53.522 --> 00:40:54.890
What did you just say?

00:41:00.029 --> 00:41:01.597
DRIED SALMON

00:41:01.664 --> 00:41:04.066
Okay, over here.

00:41:04.767 --> 00:41:05.968
Please write your name.

00:41:09.972 --> 00:41:12.641
-Do I have to?
-Yes.

00:41:14.476 --> 00:41:15.411
Okay.

00:41:17.846 --> 00:41:18.714
SAKU SAKUTA

00:41:18.781 --> 00:41:22.318
Oh, by the way, I asked the landlord,

00:41:22.384 --> 00:41:23.619
and I borrowed an empty unit.

00:41:23.686 --> 00:41:25.220
-What?
-Really?

00:41:25.287 --> 00:41:26.889
Until I find a new place to move.

00:41:26.956 --> 00:41:28.290
Please treat me well.

00:41:33.462 --> 00:41:34.296
Okay!

00:41:34.363 --> 00:41:39.702
PARTY C - SAKU SAKUTA

00:41:42.037 --> 00:41:44.840
The garden shovel

00:41:44.907 --> 00:41:47.509
Was wet all day

00:41:48.077 --> 00:41:51.213
Then the rain stopped

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.383
And I sneezed

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.352
After the beep tone,

00:41:56.418 --> 00:41:59.154
please leave your name and message.

00:41:59.221 --> 00:42:01.090
Hello, Mom?

00:42:01.156 --> 00:42:02.424
Hey, Mom.

00:42:02.491 --> 00:42:04.426
Remember that time the three of us
went to the dam?

00:42:04.493 --> 00:42:05.294
NO PLANS FOR DISCHARGE

00:42:05.361 --> 00:42:06.795
On the way back, in the car,

00:42:06.862 --> 00:42:09.231
we all sang at the top of our lungs.

00:42:09.832 --> 00:42:11.600
I can’t remember what song it was,

00:42:11.667 --> 00:42:14.069
but I had so much fun.

00:42:15.437 --> 00:42:19.274
We’ll probably never
go out together like that…

00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:19.942
DAM CURRY

00:42:20.009 --> 00:42:22.111
…never eat curry together,
or sing like that ever again.

00:42:22.177 --> 00:42:24.913
But that timeline… It really existed.

00:42:26.115 --> 00:42:28.817
Someday, tell me more
about your memories, Mom.

00:42:29.418 --> 00:42:30.753
Talk to you soon.

00:42:36.525 --> 00:42:39.495
The fresh laundry…

00:42:39.561 --> 00:42:40.429
Thank you.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:44.099
If you came all this way,
you must've not found a house yet.

00:42:44.166 --> 00:42:45.367
I think it'll be soon.

00:42:45.434 --> 00:42:46.802
Oh yeah?

00:42:46.869 --> 00:42:48.370
I thought maybe
you had lingering feelings.

00:42:49.038 --> 00:42:52.007
-No, not at all.
-Really?

00:42:55.444 --> 00:42:57.880
-Yeah, nope.
-A bit cold, huh?

00:42:59.048 --> 00:43:01.216
La la la

00:43:01.283 --> 00:43:04.086
A rainbow, a rainbow

00:43:04.153 --> 00:43:06.889
Stretched across the sky

00:43:06.955 --> 00:43:09.625
And your, your

00:43:09.692 --> 00:43:12.494
Mood cleared up too

00:43:12.561 --> 00:43:15.497
Surely tomorrow

00:43:15.564 --> 00:43:18.267
Will be a clear sky

00:43:18.333 --> 00:43:21.236
Surely tomorrow

00:43:21.303 --> 00:43:24.673
Will be a clear sky

00:43:26.075 --> 00:43:28.277
Nacchi!

00:43:28.343 --> 00:43:29.445
Hey, what's up?

00:43:29.511 --> 00:43:30.846
Hey, Nacchi.

00:43:33.115 --> 00:43:34.383
-What are you doing?
-She's crazy.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:35.484
I'm studying.

00:43:35.551 --> 00:43:36.385
What?

00:43:36.952 --> 00:43:38.654
Koinobori!

00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:39.788
-One plus one?
-How do I solve this?

00:43:39.855 --> 00:43:41.323
-Which one?
-What's two plus…

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:42.424
-This.
-Make yourself at home.

00:43:42.491 --> 00:43:44.259
-Okay.
-You can sit wherever.

00:43:44.326 --> 00:43:45.661
-Got it.
-Thanks.
