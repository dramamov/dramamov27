WEBVTT

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.110
Kyung Chae, you...

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.780
(Episode 97)

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.910
So, this is what you were really thinking?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.850
That you were just using me,
and you'd toss me aside when I'm no use.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.590
You're a real wench.
How could you do this to me?

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.820
Hey.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.290
You're just like Father.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.800
If you want to see your future,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.830
just look at Father.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.540
I'm telling you, that's not what I meant.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.480
- Just hear me out.
- Let go! You brat!

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.550
- Ji Seop!
- What? Won't you let go?

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.020
You only call me your brother,
but you don't even treat me like one.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.320
Ji Seop!

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.090
Ji Seop!

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.930
What do you think you're doing?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.200
What did I do?

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.270
Did you lure my brother
to the chairman's office on purpose?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.070
Well, maybe you
should have been nicer to him.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.540
What kind of sister says something
like that to her own brother?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.380
Do you really think this will stop him
from giving me his stake?

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.950
Who's to say?
But I guess we'll find out, won't we?

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.420
I hear the shareholders' meeting
is just around the corner.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.890
You'll really stoop to anything,
won't you?

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.420
You're so petty and crude,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.330
going so far as to turn
a brother and sister against each other.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.570
Petty and crude? I learned that
from you, Min Kyung Chae.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.570
What did you say?

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.800
Not knowing how to fight fair,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.410
you're so blinded
by winning you'll do anything.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.110
That's the Min Kyung Chae way, isn't it?

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.080
From now on, I'm giving you a taste
of your own medicine.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.450
Just so you know.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.920
Where's the Vice Director?

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.060
He went to the chairman's office earlier
and hasn't returned yet.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.940
Sun Jae.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.770
- What's wrong?
- Find my brother for me.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.280
He has to be in the company somewhere.
Find him and bring him to me, quickly.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.580
Why? What's going on with Ji Seop?

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.580
He might not side with us
at the shareholders' meeting.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.720
What? What on earth is wrong with him now?

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.550
I'll explain later. Just find him first.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.860
Calm him down so he won't change his mind.
No matter what, I need to get his stake.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.560
You know what I mean, right?

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.460
I understand.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.100
Even if the Vice Director is a pushover,
after how his own sister treated him,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.440
I doubt he'll side with them.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.870
But for him to come over to our side,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.810
he doesn't really have a good reason to.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.580
I suppose that's true for now.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.120
Still, you should sound him out at home.
You never know, right?

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.650
He's turned his back on Min Kyung Chae,
but he has no other good options.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.220
If you offer an olive branch,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.920
he may just pretend
he's reluctant and take it.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.330
I'll give it a shot.
It's a fifty-fifty chance, after all.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.070
If Director Min or the Vice Director
comes over to our side,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.670
then Madam Jang's three percent stake
will be the deciding vote.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.240
Exactly.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.170
It's such a relief that it's her, though.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.950
I know.
It's a huge relief that we can trust her.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.180
Of course.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.250
I mean, think about how we survived
that hellish time in the United States.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.320
We relied on each other more than
a birth mother and daughter would.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.860
Come to think of it,
when I first met you two,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.860
I honestly thought
you were mother and daughter.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.850
Here, drink up and calm down.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.320
I don't know who told you what,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.020
but if it came from someone else,
just ignore it.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.290
It came straight from Kyung Chae's mouth.
So there's no denying it, right?

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.960
You have that little faith
in your own sister?

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.900
Trust her? Of all people?

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
You'd better wake up and face reality.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.110
Even married couples get divorced.
Engagements are easily broken.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.480
She only ever thinks about herself.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.410
All she cares about is
how to use the people around her.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.750
Her heart...

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.350
is as hard as a rock. You get me?

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.020
Business is business.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.120
Leave your personal feelings out of it
and focus on the shareholders' meeting.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.930
We have to get rid of that woman first,
don't we?

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.000
You two are just alike, aren't you?

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.500
You're telling me this at a time
like this? Just shut up.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.810
Hey. Kyung Chae
will never get my stake. Got it?

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.550
This is so frustrating.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.300
Why the bad mood ever since you got home?
Did something happen at work?

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.600
I don't know. Don't ask.
It's too painful to talk about.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.740
Come on, what is it? What happened?

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.240
Kyung Chae is treating me
like a complete fool.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.780
What? What did Kyung Chae do?

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.120
She promised to give me a position
if I backed her at the shareholder vote.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.750
I know that part.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.590
But that brat planned
to just take my shares...

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.860
and then kick me back out to the store.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.660
What? What did you just say?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.430
Are you serious?

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.530
That's Ji Seop for you. Same in college.
Once he got angry, he was unstoppable.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.770
I'm so furious
I fell for her little scheme.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.570
Unless a legal guardian is appointed
for the Chairman's 28 percent stake,

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.640
it becomes a dormant Stake
with no voting rights.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.810
If we secure over 28 percent of shares
to fill that gap,

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.780
we will become the largest shareholder.
It's a shame it didn't work out.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.820
The meeting's tomorrow. What do we do?

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.080
What do you mean?

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.620
Of course
we're proceeding with the meeting.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.990
You hold a 15 percent stake,

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.650
which makes you the largest shareholder
after the chairman.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.460
That's enough to call for a meeting.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.490
However, if Ji Seop spitefully
sides with them in this situation,

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.100
things will get a bit more complicated.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.930
No matter how mad my brother is at me,
he wouldn't side with her, would he?

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.770
I know my brother.
Like our Father, he can't betray family.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.340
Well, that's a relief.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.910
If anything, Soo Jung is the wild card.
She can't stand to see me succeed.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.540
You don't have to worry about her.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.450
I discreetly sounded out Director Oh,
and she said she's staying neutral.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.120
She will be sitting this one out.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.580
Well, that's a relief.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.590
Then all Lucia has is the 7 percent stake
Father gifted her,

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.620
so I don't have much
to worry about, right?

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.190
For now.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.830
Yes.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.110
What are you doing in here now?

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.740
I just wanted to see you.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.780
We saw plenty of each other at the office.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.580
Why did you have to come all the way here?

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.050
Are you upset about something?

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.920
Listen. Kyung Chae planned
to use Ji Seop for his shares...

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.520
- and just toss him aside...
- Stop.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.500
You saw it all, so why the questions?
Just because I fell out with her...

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.400
doesn't mean I'm going to side with you.
So just get out.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.510
So if Min Ji Seop gives Lucia his shares
instead of Min Kyung Chae,

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.210
that changes the whole game, right?

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.280
Yes, that's true in theory,
but you never know what someone will do.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.780
And what about Min Soo Jung?

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.510
It's the same with her.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.820
The problem now is that Min Kyung Chae...

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.090
who is now the largest shareholder
with her 15 percent stake...

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.490
excluding Chairman Min.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.490
and can oust Lucia at the meeting.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.930
And if it passes at the meeting,
it's over.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.200
So as the largest shareholder,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.470
Min Kyung Chae
can replace the executives, right?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.800
That's right.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.940
We're in big trouble.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.370
Even with my three percent stake,
we'll only have ten percent.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.610
And they'll have 15 percent.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.710
Isn't anyone willing to sell their shares
at a time like this?

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.220
Right, Oh Pan Sool.
What happened with that old man?

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.990
I told him to sell his Mingang shares,

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.990
but I don't know what will come of it.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.090
I'm home.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.060
Welcome back!

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.170
You're just in time.
You must have a sixth sense for good food.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.370
Did you make something tasty?

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.910
Come on, sit down.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.650
Are we having pork belly tonight?

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.950
It smells so good!

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.180
This thing is amazing.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.420
I don't have to lift a finger
because it cooks everything by itself.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.220
- It's so convenient, right?
- It really is.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.890
- The oil doesn't splatter either?
- I know, right?

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.230
What's the occasion?
I can't believe you came home with this.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.830
To what do I owe this lovely gesture
from Oh Pan Sool?

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.340
Oh Pan Sool is the last great patriarch
who adores his wife.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.140
I can't bear to see you working so hard
in the kitchen.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.040
Here it comes.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.510
Hurry and bring it over.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:38.950
Here we go!

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.380
Look at that!

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.220
Thank you for the meal.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:43.490
Dig in.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.860
This is so good.
It's crispy outside and juicy inside.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.730
It's a fall gift from the patriarch.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.130
It's the modern way to grill pork belly.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.800
It's perfect for you, Mal Sook,
as you love pork belly.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.400
That's true, but...

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.740
Doesn't this seem strange to you?
My husband isn't usually like this.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.680
- You're up to something, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.250
- You got into trouble, didn't you?
- No.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.410
Spit it out.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.650
That hurts!
Is this what I get for showing my love?

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.450
This household isn't a patriarchy.
It's a matriarchy.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.660
Fine, then! Take it back! Return it!

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.560
Hey, come on.
By the way, where did you even find this?

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.660
The color is really stylish, too.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.530
I know, right?
Who gives a gift just to take it back?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.230
What do you mean, "return it"?
We can use this when Ja Kyung comes over.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.270
And I'm taking it with us
when we go on trips.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.470
Let me see if it's ready.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.310
Hey, I've been thinking
about that tip you gave me.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.180
And I'm about to make a decision.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.520
So you'll sell your stake in Mingang
and invest in something else?

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.020
Yes, Ms. Stella has been working
very hard on this.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.620
So I'm trusting her
and finally making a real investment.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.420
That's a very wise decision.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.960
But if your wife finds out,
she'll probably be against it.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.600
She is simpler than she looks.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.130
I already buttered her up
with that gift...

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.200
Buttered me up with what?

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.040
No, I said I showered you with love!
You really snuck up on me.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.610
When did you even make the fried rice?

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.940
I didn't make it. This thing did.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.380
Go on, have some.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.950
You're definitely acting suspicious.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.980
Suspicious? Is that some kind of award?
I haven't done anything to win a prize.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.620
Am I some kind of actor, getting an award?

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.990
It was a patriarch's joke.
You should laugh.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.290
Let's see here.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.000
It's searing hot!
It's delicious when hot, and vice versa.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.600
It's too hot, but it's so good.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.870
This isn't three-layer pork belly,
it's seven-layer!

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.770
What a clown. Good grief, just ignore him.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.170
You go ahead and eat up.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.540
Will do!

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.810
- It's so good eaten right off the grill.
- I know, right?

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.750
- We need to talk.
- I have nothing to say to you.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.120
Come on, you're my brother!

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.320
Don't say 'brother' if you don't mean it!

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.830
Perfect timing, Kyung Chae.
I heard from him everything.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.970
Good heavens, after hearing
the way you disrespected my husband,

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.000
I was so shocked that I was speechless!

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.910
Where are you going? I'm not finished.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:26.150
This is perfect. Since everyone's here,
we can just ask them.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.650
Whose fault is it that Father's like this?
I happen to think it's Kyung Chae's.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.420
Ms. Ja Kyung, how can you say
something like that?

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.190
Did I say something out of line?

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.930
What kind of daughter
kidnaps her own father?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.560
- If you don't know, keep your mouth shut.
- Oh my goodness!

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.030
Manager Gong,
who do you think you're yelling at?

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.200
Don't disrespect Ms. Kyung Chae.
I won't stand for it.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.510
The more I listen, the more annoyed I get.
Manager Gong, this is out of line.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.910
You seem to have forgotten your place.
We're the employers here.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.250
And you're the employee.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.650
What do you think you're doing, Ji Seop?
How can you be so rude to Manager Gong?

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.820
Who was the one being rude first?
Didn't you see how she treated Kyung Chae?

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.260
That's because your wife started it.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.460
Really?
Who do you think picked this fight?

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.330
This is so annoying.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.340
Apologize to my wife!

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.140
Don't.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.580
What are you doing, Ji Seop?

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.280
Do you have any idea who Manager Gong is?
How dare you order her to apologize?

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.520
I don't care who she is.
She's below your sister-in-law, right?

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.220
That's so childish.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:41.160
Look who's calling who childish.
Or are you not childish, just pure evil?

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.360
Watch your mouth.
Don't talk to Ms. Kyung Chae like that.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.460
Oh, please.
Who do you think you are, acting that way?

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.200
So Kyung Chae disrespects my husband.
You think you can do it too?

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.840
Honestly, what's wrong with you?
You should at least stop him.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.610
You little brat! You need to get a grip.
How dare you talk to my wife that way!

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.510
Who are you calling a brat?

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.510
This is a Min family matter.
Stay out of it.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.180
Manager Gong is family, too.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:09.290
Family? That's rich coming from you.
You ignore your own half-sister,

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.860
- but you'd do anything for a housekeeper.
- Are you done?

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.290
No! I'm just getting started.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.200
If I said everything on my mind,
it would take four days.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.000
- Get away from her.
- Oh, my...

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.370
Did you just lay a hand on my husband?

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.500
What do you think you're doing?

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.310
What do you think you're doing?

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.080
Please, just stop.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.440
Did you just push me?

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.250
What has gotten into you?

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.520
"What's wrong?" You started this!
How dare you touch me!

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.320
- Ms. Kyung Chae!
- Let go!

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:45.190
- Ms. Kyung Chae!
- Stop it! Stay still. Don't struggle.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.220
- You're going to get hurt!
- Stop.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.790
- I told you to stop struggling.
- Stop it!

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.530
I don't understand
why our family is always like this.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.470
Can't we be like other families?
Laughing, caring, and being supportive?

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.480
We're not exactly a normal family, are we?

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.750
I'd rather be normal. What's all this for?
Is money really everything?

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.080
I'd rather be poor
if we could just care for each other.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.820
I didn't realize you felt that way, Se Ri.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.760
The way our family
has turned out like this.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.930
Maybe it's some kind of punishment.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.500
What do you mean by that?

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.000
Because we're all selfish and greedy.
None of us has lived a good life.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.510
I miss Dad.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.380
Do you want to go see Dad tomorrow?

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.950
(Hankuk Hospital)

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.630
Dad, please wake up!

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.060
Se Ri. He's unconscious,
but can still hear you.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.300
If you have something to say, go ahead.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.600
Dad, do you recognize me?

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.570
It's me, Se Ri.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:12.040
Dad, how did this happen to you?
Who did this to you?

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.650
Dad, please wake up. Please?

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.550
Dad, how much longer are you going
to lie here like this?

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.950
Dad, you have to get your strength back
and wake up. All right?

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.490
Dad.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.400
After that huge scene yesterday,

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.500
there's no way Ji Seop
will give his stake to Kyung Chae.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.140
Then it all comes down to that 15 percent.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.170
If she's suspended as acting chairman
at the shareholders' meeting,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.910
whose side am I even supposed to be on?

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.210
Yes?

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.820
The shareholders' meeting starts soon.
Why are you just sitting here?

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.090
Do you have any way of beating my sister?

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.730
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:03.830
There is one.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.660
For you to take my side.

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.270
And you think I'd do that?

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.140
Then why else would you have come to me?

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.070
I just...

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.310
If you expect me to promise
that I’ll give you the CEO position...

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.780
once I get past this crisis,

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:21.910
you can turn around and leave.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.450
I don't make deals like that.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.390
Because I know all too well
how easily those promises can be broken.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.290
I shouldn't have wasted my time
coming here.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.020
Good luck with that.
I'm staying out of it.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.000
No one has ever gone up
against my sister and survived.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:39.630
I'll be watching.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.130
I may not be able to promise you
the CEO position,

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.040
but I can promise you
that Min Kyung Chae...

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.510
will never be in that seat.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.640
(Mingang Distribution)

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.480
Isn't that a pretty good offer?

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.260
Do you want to grab a drink
after work today?

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.660
Sorry, I can't.
I have to head straight home.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.600
How about a quick cup of coffee then?

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.270
- Why all of a sudden?
- No reason.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.340
Come on, it's not like
we can't even grab a coffee together.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.350
The shareholders' meeting
is coming up soon.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.120
Come on, not you too, Director Moon?

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.790
Why? To fight against Kyung Chae
with my stake?

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.760
- Why is everyone so desperate to use me?
- No, that's not it at all.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.700
Whatever happens with the shareholders,
it will get tough for you.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.530
So what? Are you pitying me now?

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.610
It's not pity.
I'm concerned as your colleague and boss.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.310
So don't get pulled in every direction.
Stand your ground.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.980
It'll make things easier on you.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.350
You're really...

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.150
worried about me?

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.480
Of course. What else could it be?

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.690
So you're trying to win him over
with the carrot instead of the stick?

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.900
Do you think that'll make Ji Seop
hand his stake over to you?

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.630
Is that the only way your mind works?

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.900
Are all relationships
just transactional to you?

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.410
So you were genuinely worried
about Ji Seop?

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.670
Is that so hard to believe?

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.880
He can't side with his sister right now,
but as her brother, he can't abandon her.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.780
Can you imagine
how conflicted he must feel?

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.550
And another thing.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.620
You're his friend
and his future brother-in-law.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.090
Shouldn't you be the one showing him
some consideration, not me?

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.360
There you go
with the holier-than-thou act again.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.890
This is why I can't stand you.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.800
Stop acting so high and mighty...

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.730
and take off your mask.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.230
My mask?

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.770
You think I don't know who you are?

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:02.970
Instead of worrying about who I am,

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:04.780
Kim Sun Jae,

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.580
you should take a good, hard look
at the kind of person you are.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.610
You said to me last time,

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.780
"Life is like a boomerang."

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:17.220
Take a good look
at the life you've lived...

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.460
and see if you truly have no regrets.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.660
The sins you committed, knowingly or not,

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.400
are about to come back around.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.700
The day they'll come back to strike you
is drawing near.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.640
Go on and run your mouth.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:40.980
Once the shareholders' meeting starts,

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.710
Baek Sul Hee, the woman you trust,
is going down,

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.350
and when she does,
you're going down with her.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.330
My son.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.040
Mom is going to do
something important today.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.640
You'll be watching over me, won't you?

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.140
Once Lucia becomes chairman
of Mingang Distribution,

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.680
we'll start by making your accident
from 20 years ago public.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.420
That car accident...

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.920
wasn't a coincidence.
It was ordered by Min Doo Sik.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:24.960
It was a premeditated murder.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.720
So now, you need...

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.190
to forget Min Kyung Chae.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.600
She's nothing but bad karma for you.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.140
We still have some time
before the shareholders' meeting.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.800
Once the shareholders' meeting begins,

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.540
we'll file for suspension
of her acting duties...

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.740
and you'll be reinstated immediately.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:44.980
That's the plan.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.280
That's why this meeting is so important.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.490
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.660
(New Message)

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.740
(Director Min Soo Jung)

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.710
Everyone, please come
to the chairman's office now.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.610
I have something to say
before the shareholders' meeting,

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.040
It's an important matter,
so get here right away.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.410
What do you think you're doing?

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.010
Why did you call everyone here like this?

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.040
The shareholders' meeting
is about to start.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.080
There's something we need
to settle as a group first.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.780
Settle what?

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.590
There's no need to air our dirty laundry
in front of everyone, is there?

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.520
It's better to handle this
amongst ourselves.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.320
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.560
We still have time.
Before everyone starts to gather,

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.600
cancel the shareholders' meeting.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.930
Is it because you know you can't win...

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.870
with that 7 percent stake
you got from my father?

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.670
So now you're backing down?

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.040
Couldn't you find anyone
to give you their stake?

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.340
I don't know why you even bothered
with that measly amount.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.020
I tried to spare you the embarrassment,
but I see that's not going to work.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.420
Fine. Shall we settle this
right here, then?

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:38.660
And you, Ji Seop?

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.260
What are you going to do with your stake?

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.990
Just leave me out of this.
I'm not transferring my stake.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.130
So in the end,
this is just between you and me.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:47.860
But what a shame.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.570
My stake alone is 15 percent,

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.370
which makes me the largest shareholder,
excluding my father, who can't vote.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.410
Anything else you'd like to say?

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.680
(Mingang Distribution)

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.550
If you have nothing else to say,
I'll be on my way.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:11.960
I need to check on
the meeting preparations,

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.520
and I have a lot on my plate.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:15.590
Wait!

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.890
Why haven't you asked me?

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.160
What would happen
if I were to give you my stake?

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.630
Don't tell me...

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:28.710
This is exactly why I can't stand you.
You've always been the type to backstab.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.980
I was just asking hypothetically,
but your reaction now...

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.110
is really making me want
to give my stake to her.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.910
Go ahead. Do whatever you want.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.320
Even if you do, that's only 14 percent
between the two of you.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.190
It may only be a one percent difference,
but I'd still be the largest shareholder.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.320
I can call a shareholders' meeting
and have you both ousted at once!

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.290
Says who?

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.200
Who says you're the largest shareholder?

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.200
Madam Jang? What are you doing here?

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.340
My three percent stake.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.180
If I were to transfer it to
Acting Chairman Jung Lucia,

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.940
will that change things?

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.360
You said
there was a one percent difference, right?

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:26.430
Well, then,
Lucia will have a two percent lead, right?

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.300
Wow!

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.100
That means the largest shareholder...

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.070
changes at this very moment.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040
Bravo!

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.340
Bravo!

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.350
Bravo!

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.790
How can Madam Jang
have a three percent stake?

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.860
I'm sure I checked on that.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:02.770
Something's not right.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:07.000
The stake Se Ri lost to that con artist
was exactly three percent.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.370
But surely you don't think Madam Jang...

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:11.240
Come to think of it,

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.340
if Lucia is the enforcer out front,

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:19.250
then Madam Jang must be the final boss
pulling the strings.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.220
It started with her planting Lucia
at Mingang.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:25.320
Yes, that's it.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.960
This was all her plan
from the very beginning.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.030
What on earth does she have against me?

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.800
What did I ever do to her?

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:40.340
I can't let this stand.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.370
I'm going to confront her myself.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.910
Wait, you're going to confront her
emotionally without any proof?

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.350
Then what do you expect me to do?

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.250
Madam Jang is nothing like Lucia.
She's a sly old fox.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.790
If you go in there without a plan,
we're the ones who will get hurt.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.390
Still, I have to go and ask her myself
why she's trying so hard to stop me.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.470
If you're going to go,
there's something you should know.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.540
It might help.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:16.940
What is it?

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.380
Madam Jang is...

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:24.450
David Jung's...

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.880
or Jung Ho Se's...

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:30.450
birth mother.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:34.860
She's Ho Se's...

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.790
birth mother?

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.050
