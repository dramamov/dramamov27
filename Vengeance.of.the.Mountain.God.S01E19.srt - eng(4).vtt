00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.560
It's gone.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.440
Is that Duan Jiuye?

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.080
Everything's gone.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.720
How did Duan Jiuye end up like this?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.520
Duan Jiuye is gone.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.160
Move aside, don't look.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.120
It's gone.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.040
Duan Jiuye.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.240
It's over. Come with me.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.560
Didn't you tell me

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.240
Jin Shisan lost to Duan Jiuye?

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.240
Then...

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.400
I...

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.800
So who made your Jin Shisan

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.160
just like the hero in a novel?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.000
He was killed by villains in one chapter,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.720
then healed and revived the next.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.240
He slaps and kills the bad guys.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.880
After all, he's your unbeatable, charming Jin Shisan.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.200
Nothing surprises me anymore.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.400
How did he become mine?

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.880
We're out on the street.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Let me save some face, please.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.240
I'm leaving.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.160
Where are you going?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.840
Going home to report to my father.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.240
I haven't seen Jin Shisan.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.680
As long as he's safe, that's enough.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.200
Why am I worrying for nothing?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.320
It's all your fault, see?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.040
I've put all my money into this.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.560
We agreed on everything before.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.760
I'm telling you,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.800
if not for Duan Jiuye,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.120
my Lu family had four ginseng shops,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.120
now there's only one left.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.160
The whole family just sits around the shop

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.840
barely getting by on thin porridge.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.720
And also...

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.760
In the Xinyou year,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.120
Duan Jiuye took our orders from Zhili.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.120
He made money that year,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.160
left my father so angry he coughed blood.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.440
Speak up, will you?

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.080
Why hide things from others?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.560
I eat meat, you don't even get soup.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.800
I bribe the officials,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.800
I want what's yours.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.040
I give gifts to the royals,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.960
I want what's yours.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.280
Your guild has been robbed and attacked before.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.320
But now, when I mess up,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.400
everyone's whispering here.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.200
Duan Jiuye.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.040
You've worked too hard for too long.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.680
It's hard to always be fair to everyone.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.680
Everyone here

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.480
has some resentment in their hearts.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.960
That's right, isn't it?

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.840
But today we're here

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.680
not to make a scene.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.400
You bought and hoarded ginseng, borrowed money,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.480
but lost the guild's main stock.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.200
I touched the main stock,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.760
broke the rules.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.760
I'll go outside the pass and wait to die.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.280
This chair—

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.120
whoever wants it can have it.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.840
I don't care for it.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.120
Duan Jiuye.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.320
Give us an explanation.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.560
Everyone, listen to me.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.400
Everyone, listen to me.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.560
What's going on? Yeah.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.040
Boss Jin spent money

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.200
to buy back the guild's main stock for us.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.600
He made up for Duan Jiuye's mistake.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.560
My Lu family ginseng shop

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.920
is the first to recommend Jin Shisan of the Jin family shop

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.600
as the leader of the Changbai Mountain Ginseng Guild.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.120
Does everyone agree?

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.760
Agreed! Agreed! Agreed!

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.280
Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan!

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.200
Yang family ginseng shop

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.960
nominates Jin Shisan of the Jin family.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:49.840
Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan!

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.480
Thank you, everyone.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.200
Jin Shisan.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.960
Thank you.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.920
Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan!

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.480
Thank you.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.200
Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan!

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:08.320
Good.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.200
Congratulations!

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.960
Good.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.200
Good.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.040
Good.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.480
Old Duan is on the move.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.560
My men are following him.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.440
He can't escape.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.040
Remember to leave him alive when you act.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.880
Right.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.160
Make him bow to Old Jin before he dies.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.400
I have a few things to ask him myself.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.320
Let's go.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.840
Jin Shisan.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.160
If you have things to do tonight,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.720
we won't bother you.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.040
We'll talk next time.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.280
I really can't stand watching this.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.000
Ever since you came back from Fengtian,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.040
you've been avoiding him.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.200
Didn't you have so much to say

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.400
to Jin Shisan?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.560
Now's your chance.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.760
Jin Shisan, are you mute too?

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.880
I—no, tonight we...

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.320
Shut up.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.480
Come with me.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.000
If you have something to do,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.320
just go.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.280
Don't worry about me.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.440
There is something.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.880
It's on my mind.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.280
It's a big deal.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.680
If it's on your mind,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.680
why not say it out loud?

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.720
Let me help you share the burden.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.760
If it's a big deal,

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.480
why not ask the Yang family for help?

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.000
My father already promised the Yang family would help you.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.160
I live on the edge, risking my life.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.040
If I make one mistake,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.400
the Yang family could get dragged in.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:32.960
I'm afraid to implicate you.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.760
I'm not afraid.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.880
I promised your father I'd protect you for life.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.600
But I'm afraid.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.200
In the end, you do care about me.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.160
But you don't understand me.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.000
I'm the second daughter of the Yang family shop.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.400
Whether it's digging ginseng in the mountains

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.760
or running the business,

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.840
I'm not inferior to you.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.040
I'm not some pampered young lady.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.000
I can share the burdens of the one I love.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:10.960
Ruyi

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.440
Don't say anything more.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.160
During those days in Fengtian, I figured it out.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.040
Jin Shisan, your heart is cold.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.440
I can try my best to warm it up.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.760
Your vengeance, your hatred—

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.480
I'll bear them with you.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
Because you're the man I've chosen.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.720
Let's talk tomorrow.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.160
Is that okay?

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:42.680
Alright.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.560
Then I won't disturb Boss Jin's business.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:46.760
Ruyi

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.120
Tonight—

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.200
I only want tonight.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.280
Maybe tonight all grudges will end.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.480
When tomorrow comes,

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.840
maybe I can let everything go.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.000
Then I'll come find you.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.600
I'll have a clear answer in my heart.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.280
Okay.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.720
Jin Shisan

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.440
I'll wait for you.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.240
Duan Jiuye, you won't take the main road,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.160
nor stay at the inn.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.160
Traveling at night is dangerous.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.280
Are you stupid?

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.480
So many people are after my head.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.400
I'm afraid I'll check in with my head,

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.640
but leave without it.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.960
Keep moving.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.400
Who?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.720
What are you doing? Don't light it!

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.040
I told you not to!

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.040
Duan Jiuye

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.160
Duan Jiuye

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.400
Duan Jiuye

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.600
Duan Jiuye

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.800
I told you to shut up!

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.520
Jin Shisan

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.240
You coward!

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.480
Even as a ghost, I won't let you go!

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.280
Tell me—how did my father die?

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.600
I can give you a quick death.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.600
Your father was just too stubborn.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.040
He wouldn't let go of The Nine Immortals' Compass.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.480
No wonder your Jin family was wiped out.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.840
Speak!

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.840
Seems you only know part

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.480
of what happened three years ago.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.080
You don't know the rest.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
Back then—

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.080
Go!

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:37.600
Hurry!

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.840
Duan Jiuye, they didn't follow us.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.400
Let's catch our breath before moving on.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.400
Really.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.720
Your loyalty to me—

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.280
I haven't treated you well for nothing.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.720
Duan Jiuye is a true hero.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.160
We're all willing to help you rise again.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.480
Duan Jiuye, maybe we should go back and plan.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.040
Come.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.640
Slow down.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.280
No.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.960
I'm going back to kill them.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.520
I'm taking Jin Shisan's damned life!

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.160
Duan Jiuye, don't rush.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.720
There's an important guest waiting for you.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.280
What bad luck.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.480
That bastard Duan Lao Jiu got away.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.280
Shouldn't have wasted words with him.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.160
Should've just—

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.960
Sent him down to apologize to Boss Jin in person.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.600
We still haven't figured out the temple incident.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.040
He can't die yet.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.160
If no one had saved him,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.520
he'd have died eight hundred times by now.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.240
The one who took Duan Jiu away—

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.040
doesn't want to tangle with us.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.800
Nor do they want a fight.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.720
Doesn't seem like his people.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.840
There must be someone else behind this.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.640
Someone else.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.160
Who could it be?

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.840
I don't care who it is.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.840
I'll gather the men right now.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.480
Even if we turn Songling Town upside down,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.960
we'll drag Duan Jiu out.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:53.640
Uncle Luo

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.720
Don't rush.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.720
If someone really helped him,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.960
he's already out of town by now.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.920
Or maybe he's hiding somewhere.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.040
Brother Jinzi, what do we do now?

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:06.400
Wait.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.800
Jinzi

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.080
Waiting like this won't work.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.160
If that old bastard leaves town,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.080
how will we ever find him?

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.720
We have what he wants.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.800
He won't leave.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.600
He'll definitely come.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.800
Even if he doesn't,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.040
the one behind him will.
