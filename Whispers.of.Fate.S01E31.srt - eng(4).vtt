[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.880
[Episode 31]

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.120
Your stomachache...

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.740
Does Liu Yan know about it?

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.700
He doesn't trust me.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.150
You're truly insane.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.740
Insane?

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.350
Maybe I am.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.420
But I thought

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.740
you would understand me, Shen.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.640
Even if God

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.000
wants Fang Zhou to die,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.800
I won't allow it.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.210
If I don't allow it,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.680
neither God

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.820
nor ghosts can make it.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.480
I can do anything.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.190
So you stole the Immortal Crystal Coffin

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.310
from Biluo Palace

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.770
just to preserve his body.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.910
But a few days ago,

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.230
Liu Yan and I went to Zhoudi Tower

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.190
only to find Fang Zhou's body missing.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.050
Ghostly Peony?

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.120
That's not the whole story.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.050
Why did you take his body away?

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.560
Why didn't you tell us?

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.810
Bringing Fang Zhou back to life is

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.340
the most important secret.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.510
Except for Shui Duopo and Liu Yan,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.190
I haven't told anyone else about it.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.520
I'm asking why you

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.840
stole his body for no reason,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.240
and why you hid it from us!

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.250
I told you it's a secret.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.280
Tang Lici,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.730
bringing Fang Zhou back to life

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.400
means you'll have to die.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.150
Right?

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.090
Am I right?

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.150
Shen.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.150
Not until this moment

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.560
did I understand

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.510
how insanely accurate

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.710
an assassin's gut feeling can be.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.510
No, no.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.070
Wait.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.690
Who said you could die?

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.360
I'm your bodyguard.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.100
What will I do if you die?

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.790
It's my own choice to seek death.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.700
It has nothing to do with you guys.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
How can it have nothing to do with us?

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.400
Are we not your friends?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.800
Like Shei,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.880
Zhong Chunji,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.350
Gu Xitan, and the others.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.940
We'll be heartbroken if you die.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.340
Is Fang Zhou your only friend?

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.750
What about us?

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.640
You are my friends.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.770
But Fang Zhou is different from you.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.070
Why?

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.920
Because he is Fang Zhou.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.350
I see you as my best friend,

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.370
Tang Lici.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.870
Is it worth it?

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.390
Shen, you are the last person

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.590
to ask that question.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.600
But at least you should

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.480
give us a chance

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.800
to help our friend.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.900
Damn fox.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.000
What does he mean, Fang Zhou is

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.040
different from me?

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.440
But...

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.430
What's...

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.070
What's

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.600
the difference between us?

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.540
Don't touch me.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.850
It's not my concern even if he dies.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.940
You're terrible at lying.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.160
Let's go back

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.240
with him.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.790
Do you like your title as Princess?

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.120
Liu Yan.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.280
If you call out,

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.000
you might no longer be able

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.260
to be Princess Lang Ya.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.300
It's good that you came out for a walk.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.090
I didn't have to break in,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.890
which spared me a lot of trouble.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.600
What are you up to?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.720
Do you like the gift I gave you?

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.840
The butterfly tattoo.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.850
You want to threaten me?

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.560
But Mother has already

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.920
recognized me

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.040
as Princess Lang Ya.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.280
Of course,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.200
every piece of information about you

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.260
matches Princess Lang Ya perfectly.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.920
Even your butterfly tattoo is

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.040
almost identical

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.870
to the Princess's tattoo.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:35.750
Right?

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.990
It's been more than a decade.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.550
Even with the best memory,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.560
the Queen herself, who made

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.870
the tattoo back then,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.870
would hardly remember
all the details now, right?

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:47.510
However,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.600
based on one last detail,

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.560
I could perhaps prove

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.600
that you are

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.120
not the Princess.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.250
The crime of deceiving the Emperor,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.920
plus your cooperation

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.360
with the Fengliu Shop.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.870
When I accepted this role back then,

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.040
I already anticipated
that this day would come.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.840
Do not think that you can use this

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.600
to threaten me to set Tang Lici up.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.750
Threaten you?

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:26.950
No.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.950
I'm not trying to threaten you.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:29.950
I want to help you.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.120
Help me?

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.480
Help you get him.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.409
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.150
He is the immensely wealthy Master

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.440
of Wanqiao Chamber,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.200
Mister Fox of unrivaled wits.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.200
He's handsome, mysterious,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.680
unmatched in martial arts,

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.240
and extremely charming.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.770
That day at Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.110
when you were on the brink
of breaking down,

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.440
he was the one who swooped in
and saved you.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.270
Don't you

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.150
want to make him yours?

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.320
The Thousand Curse Needle.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.150
I spent three years

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.120
refining it inside my body.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.190
It works the same as a curse bug,

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.590
one that feeds

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.950
on my flesh and blood.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.000
As long as you pierce it

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.260
into Tang Lici's body,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.030
it will destroy

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.930
his cultivation of the Rebirth Scroll,

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.440
making him a weakling.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.370
If you want something,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.960
you've got to fight for it by yourself.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.630
Others won't help you get them.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.870
Just like you became
the Shanfeng Branch Chief

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.730
through someone else's charity.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.670
But it was your own choice

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.270
that made you the nobler princess,

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.410
right?

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.870
Mother.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.600
Good girl.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.910
It's the most foolish decision to put

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.840
your fate in someone else's hands.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.440
You can have Tang Lici,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.100
although he doesn't love you.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.300
Just like you could become a princess

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.790
even though you're not a real one.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.160
Don't try to manipulate me.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.010
Your Highness,

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.240
you just let your happiness

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.510
slip away.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.920
Your Highness.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.080
What is it?

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.000
Master Puzhu wants to see you,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.870
saying that there's been a turn
in the battle at Tongsha River.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.550
I see.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.080
You may go first.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.760
Understood.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.210
Master!

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.390
Master,

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.790
Mr. Tang and his crew have departed.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.320
Okay.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.640
Master Jiang,

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.550
Chi Yun and I,

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.840
along with Shen Langhun,

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.670
have ridden the wild geese

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.670
to Puti Valley, deep in the Qin Mountains.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.390
Puti Valley is in the back mountain.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.200
Yique Yinyang

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.480
has built

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.390
a gigantic underground labyrinth there.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.000
Only by passing through the labyrinth

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.060
can we find the Sky-reaching Pillar.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.460
The three of us will take separate paths.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.720
If the path leads
to the Sky-reaching Pillar,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.050
we'll climb it carefully.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.250
If we reach a dead end,

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.120
we'll return
to the starting point immediately

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.960
to support those who haven't come back.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.150
At the banks of Tongsha River,

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.360
it's on you, Master Jiang,

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.220
to hold the fort

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.210
until
General Yuchi's reinforcements arrive.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.910
Head Fang was

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.420
the pillar of the martial arts world.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.200
No one is allowed

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.020
to desecrate his body.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.100
Guys, heed my command!

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:54.980
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.010
The Yanmen Sect

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.500
must defend the Tongsha River

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.120
and wait for the arrival

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.400
of Mr. Tang's reinforcements!

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.140
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.480
Why does this Sky-reaching Pillar

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.510
look so similar

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.790
to the Mystic Tree

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.930
supporting the Tianren Realm?

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.610
What was Yique Yinyang's purpose

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.030
in making this?

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.690
This is my first time seeing it.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.240
So this is what Yique Yinyang made.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.440
He emptied all the distinguished families

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.240
in the Shu territory and Qianyun

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.510
and spent years

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.240
sacrificing millions of lives

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.790
to build this bronze tree.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.940
[Sky-reaching Pillar]

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.910
Can't use the red silk here.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.750
Looks like

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.960
something's off about this place.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.960
No one can stop me from climbing up

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.420
the Sky-reaching Pillar.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.390
What is this?

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.150
It hurts just to touch it.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.680
How long will it take to climb this?

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:43.720
Is Fang Zhou's body

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.650
really up there?

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.670
Master Jiang.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:27.530
Your Highness.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.750
I heard they went to Puti Valley.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.200
Yes.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:31.640
How long ago?

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:32.530
An hour ago.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:34.570
Master Jiang,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.390
please lend me one of your wild geese.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.440
I want to go help them.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.240
Well...

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.600
I'll set off immediately.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.240
Yuchi Hu,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.510
you stay here

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.440
and assist Master Jiang as ordered.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.570
Yes, Your Highness.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.870
It took me great effort

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.870
just to climb up there.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.070
Yet there was nothing.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.800
That one on my path is also fake.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.270
So Foxy Tang's got

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:59.240
the real one?

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:00.470
We need to help him.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.560
Fang Zhou,

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.770
I'm here to save you.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.240
Nice to see you again,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.470
Holy Son,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.760
Ajibanr Tang Jia.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.360
Tuo Dragon.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.770
You thought that by escaping to Shenzhou,

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.240
your fate

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.720
could just be changed?

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.830
If fate cannot be avoided,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.310
then what is my fate

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.110
supposed to be?

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:57.590
I was born

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.680
to be locked up in the tower.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.990
You deceived and trained me

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.820
to be
the so-called Tianren (celestial being).

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.400
Holy Son.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.550
It's time for you to go slay demons.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.350
Everyone is waiting

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.300
for you to save them.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.100
And in the end,

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.900
I was supposed to die for you all

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.870
as a pitiful sacrifice

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.790
for Bai Nanzhu's wild desire
for immortality?

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:22.110
Whoever tries to change fate will be

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:24.590
bound by it!

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.350
Fang Zhou is dead.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.960
You can't save him!

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.510
No,

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.800
Fang Zhou isn't dead yet.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.880
I can save him.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.270
And only I can save him.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.920

doesn't that mean
you can finally have him?

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.310
You can have Tang Lici,

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:05.590
although he doesn't love you.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.850
Mr. Tang,

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.140
you're living such an exhausting life.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.970
If I make you a weakling,

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.400
you won't have to suffer so much.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.320
You...

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:32.300
Everyone has feelings.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.440
When you care,

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.920
you will be influenced by feelings.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.020
No one can stay calm forever

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.240
unless they're

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.200
a puppet

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.030
like me.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.200
I have no name.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.350
I can neither cry nor laugh.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.310
So emotions can never control me.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.560
I'm not afraid of death either.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.700
I'm the puppeteer behind the scenes.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:11.800

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.190

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.080
Why are you here?

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.030
Master Jiang told me

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.440
that you came to the Sky-reaching Pillar.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.510
I was worried,

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:36.980
so I came as well.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.030
What did you do to him?

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.310
I don't remember.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.740
When I saw Mr. Tang,

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.030
my body was out of control,

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.260
and I stabbed him.

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:08.270
Someone must have used

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.800
some sort of evil curse bug.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.520
Shen,

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.550
Foxy Tang is badly injured.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.550
What should we do?

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.040
Let's return to the Sword Alliance

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.440
to meet Shui Duopo first.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:32.210
Master Jiang,

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.500
that monster is way too powerful!

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.940
We can't hold on anymore!

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.820
Deploy the formation.
Defend the Tongsha River at all costs!

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:39.440
Yes!

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.790
Let me see

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.720
whether your Yanmen disciples
die out first

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.520
or I run out of ammunition first.

00:33:58.290 --> 00:33:59.390
[Wanhua Hall]

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.449
This old Jiang's stubbornness is

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.889
really no joke.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.590
Foxy Tang,

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:13.360
if you don't come back soon,

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.480
it'll be done for.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.670
After days of fierce battle
at Tongsha River,

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:19.050
the Yanmen Sect has suffered great losses.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.730
Our Yanmen fellows, who were
ready

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:21.880
to sacrifice themselves,

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.000
blocked the Fengliu Shop's attacks

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.030
for us.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.760
It's because of their sacrifice

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.620
that we can still stand here today

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.489
and continue fighting
against the Fengliu Shop.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.850
But now I want to tell you all

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.880
that if anyone wants to leave,

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.139
you may feel free to go.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:40.719
It would also be a way

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:45.070
to preserve strength
for the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.360
Fengliu Shop is awash with great fighters.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.630
Even Master Puzhu

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.110
and I are wounded.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.000
Our odds

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:55.719
of winning are probably...

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:57.000
Master Shao,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.230
there's nothing else to consider.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.190
If we can't kill Liu Yan,

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.760
the worst case is
that we die trying. So what?

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.560
That's right.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.550
If we shrink like cowards today,

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.250
how can we hold our heads up again?

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:05.780
Exactly.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.070
I agree as well.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.470
This is the first time
I've heard you curse.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.760
Sword Master,

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:13.660
please command us
to prepare for battle immediately.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.190
We'd like to follow Master Jiang's example

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.450
and fight to the death!

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.040
We'd like to follow Master Jiang's example

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:18.990
and fight to the death.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.100
Fight to the death!

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.920
We'd like to follow Master Jiang's example

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.320
and fight to the death!

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.710
We'd like to follow Master Jiang's example

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.150
and fight to the death!

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.800
Good!

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.800
Very good.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:36.550
After the battle at Tongsha River,

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:37.510
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.440
can still preserve some strength.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.880
Palace Chief Wanyu is currently
meeting with His Majesty.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.760
Now we just wait for the imperial court

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.800
and Biluo Palace to send reinforcements.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.190
I hope you, all Sword Masters,

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.070
can hold on

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.350
until reinforcements arrive.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:02.480
Radiant sunlight
shines upon our sharp swords!

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.510
Even in death, a hero's spirit endures!

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:07.840
Today,

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.510
the Central Plains Sword Alliance
vows to fight the Fengliu Shop

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:12.960
to the death!

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:14.840
Radiant sunlight

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.590
shines upon our sharp swords!

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:17.880
Even in death,

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.430
a hero's spirit endures!

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.150
Radiant sunlight

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.800
shines upon our sharp swords!

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.280
Even in death,

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.760
a hero's spirit endures!

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.920
The Central Plains Sword Alliance was
originally established

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.850
to break down background barriers

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.440
and uphold justice across the land.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.670
I never expected

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.920
that in my lifetime,

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.030
I would witness the martial arts world
of the Central Plains

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.760
pulling together for one goal.

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:41.330
Even if I

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.840
die on Mount Cloud today,

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.800
I will have

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.010
no regrets in this life.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.540
Activate the formation!

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.320
Shao Yanping has actually

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.960
activated
the Grand Mountain-Guarding Formation.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.590
If we let them delay for one more day

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.270
and the imperial court's reinforcements
arrive,

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:27.360
I'm afraid we will return

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.760
empty-handed this time.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:35.230
Master.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.400
The child curse bug is born
upon the mother curse bug's death.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:41.840
Zhong Chunji did help us in the end.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.960
Tell Qiaoyi Qiankun

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.710
not to waste ammunition for now.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:47.970
Ask him to hold the pass

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.290
and wait for my command.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:50.520
Keep Tang Lici alive.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:54.150
I want to kill him myself.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:55.000
Yes.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.280
Liu Yan has entered the Grand Formation.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.230
Go ask Master Shao for help now!

00:37:59.230 --> 00:37:59.880
Let's go!

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:00.760
Hurry!

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.350
Move quickly!

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.080
Get going!

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.680
I've heard a lot
about Mount Cloud's magnificence

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.070
and splendor.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.360
But seeing

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.550
these plain white banners today,

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.350
I feel they are

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.920
quite filthy.

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.150
The courtyard is full of white banners,

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:27.760
hung in honor of those who died fighting

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.960
for our Sword Alliance.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.590
Master Liu, please mind your words.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.250
With Tang Lici at Mount Cloud,

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.650
isn't it filthy enough?

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.150
You want Tang Lici?

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:36.360
Too bad.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:38.030
He hasn't returned

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.440
ever since he left

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.960
the Tongsha River.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:46.390
You're lying.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.760
The Fengliu Shop's forces are

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.620
just 5 kilometers away from here.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.050
Hand over Tang Lici,

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:53.650
and I can spare your lives.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.710
Trading one man's life for the lives

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:56.760
of numerous heroic fighters

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.920
at Mount Cloud,

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.300
isn't that worth it?

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.400
Sacrificing for one man's life is

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.130
not worth it.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.350
But if it's
for the meaning of righteousness,

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.650
even sacrificing
100,000 lives wouldn't be enough.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.840
Protecting the one

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.360
who murdered the Seven‑String True Tune

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.950
and is suspected of being Yique Yinyang,

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:17.110
is it what you call righteousness?

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.760
Tang Lici is not at the Sword Alliance.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.760
But even if he were,

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.420
I still wouldn't hand him over to you.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:22.340
I refuse

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.880
because this is someone you want,

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.030
someone wanted by the Fengliu Shop,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.030
which has committed countless crimes

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.630
and slaughtered innocents.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.500
Whoever the Fengliu Shop wants,

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.190
whether he's a Tang, a Zhao,

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.190
a Gao, or a Song,

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.550
whether he's a martial artist or not,

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.510
the Central Plains Sword Alliance
will protect them.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.440
Because the word "righteousness"

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.040
means reaching out to others.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.500
The word "righteousness"

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:45.640
means eliminating evil.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.030
Because the word "righteousness"
means that we must stand tall

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:50.760
and never yield to villainy!

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:03.000
Those words of yours

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
have wiped out
so many people's chances to survive.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.550
Sacrifice hundreds of lives

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:09.320
for the sake of one person.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.190
You're a group of good-for-nothings

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.030
fooled by Tang Lici.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.320
Master Shao,

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.950
you think I didn't expect that you would

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:29.300
activate
the Grand Mountain-Guarding Formation?

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.740
I've got you more

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.110
than just the Nine Qilin Transformations

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.040
repaired by the Sky-Fallen Stone.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:36.720
The Shattering Karma-Sea!

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.480
Raging Thunder!

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.110
Unable to tell loyalty from treachery,

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:45.400
right from wrong,

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.320
you've brought

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.150
all of this upon yourselves!

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.820
Pass on my command.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.700
Go all out to attack the mountain!

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.360
Cross the river!

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.800
Charge!

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.510
Hold the Tongsha River!

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.150
Kill!

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:17.510
What is that?

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Trying to escape?

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:21.350
Master,

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.620
I've found the person you are after.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.390
Tang Lici, do you think you can escape?

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.530
Master Shao.

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.570
How is it going?

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.080
As you expected,

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:36.970
Liu Yan indeed

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:38.500
went after Mr. Tang's ship.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.440
At least we've got rid of

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.190
one of the Fengliu Shop's

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.720
most formidable fighters.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.800
Next, we will

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:46.420
have to fight on our own.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:47.760
As long as we hold out until tomorrow,

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.780
reinforcements will arrive.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.050
Just not sure how long

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.240
they can hold him off on the ship.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:41:59.850
That's what happened.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.350
Ms. Zhong doesn't remember anything.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:02.000
We had no choice but to come

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.070
and ask you to check on him.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.030
How is he now?

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.770
The poison affecting him is really weird.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:13.630
I can't work out

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:15.090
a better solution for now.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.630
Meanwhile, that heart crystal is

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.360
also consuming his life force.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.480
If we take it out,

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.610
I might be able to extend his life a bit.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.340
He wouldn't agree to that.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.050
Senior,

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.630
don't waste time.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:29.030
Let's remove the heart crystal
to save him.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:30.880
You think I want to waste time?

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.670
It's not hard to remove the heart crystal.

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.280
But to force all the poison in his body

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.230
into Fang Zhou's heart crystal
in his abdomen

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.230
requires his willing cooperation.

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:40.810
Unless he's willing to do it,

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.070
no one can force it.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.190
Let's wait until he wakes up.

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.070
-Master Shao. -Master Shao.
-Master Shao.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.540
Chunji told me

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.730
that she...

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.170
Master Shao,

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.840
please don't blame Ms. Zhong.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.840
She was also manipulated by Liu Yan.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.030
Everyone, things have come to this point.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:07.760
I've got a nice plan up my sleeve

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:09.840
that needs help from you two.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.980
Where is Tang Lici?

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:24.150
Tell him to come out and see me.
