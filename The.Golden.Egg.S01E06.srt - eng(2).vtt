00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:05.910
RISE UP
SEIYA AOSHIRO

00:00:05.977 --> 00:00:07.445
Mr. Seiya Aoshiro.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:12.650
Am I really allowed to pick such
a handsome businessman for an interview?

00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:19.757
My publication is more home to
articles like that.

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:21.359
INCONSISTENT POLITICIAN'S
CONSTANT FLIP-FLOPPING

00:00:23.094 --> 00:00:26.531
Although I imagine he has flaws
since he's only human.

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:29.934
But what would dragging that out lead to?

00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:31.936
No.

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:37.442
If this feature gets greenlit,
I could take charge of my own work.

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:39.878
My chance is finally here.

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:49.187
His family's apparel business
was in the red during the recession.

00:00:49.754 --> 00:00:53.391
He started helping out the business
while he was a student

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:56.961
and began working there in earnest
after graduation, started reorganizing,

00:00:57.028 --> 00:00:58.830
causing sales to grow steadily.

00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:01.332
The rise of a young executive.

00:01:02.634 --> 00:01:03.501
Come in.

00:01:08.907 --> 00:01:11.009
How's it going?

00:01:12.477 --> 00:01:14.445
I've read a few articles.

00:01:14.512 --> 00:01:15.446
What'd you think?

00:01:16.548 --> 00:01:19.217
He's exactly how I imagined.

00:01:19.284 --> 00:01:21.586
He's not a typical nepo baby.

00:01:21.653 --> 00:01:23.888
He actually worked hard.

00:01:25.657 --> 00:01:26.925
That's true.

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:29.460
He cares about the employees,

00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:32.931
he has good character,
and a strong sense of responsibility.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.970
He just seems perfect in every single way.

00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:43.508
So where can I find an interesting
and unexpected angle?

00:01:44.442 --> 00:01:45.910
I don't have a clue.

00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:49.614
What list of questions could I send?

00:01:51.182 --> 00:01:53.885
I can give you one helpful tip
you may find useful.

00:01:57.455 --> 00:02:00.325
The guy's way greedier than he looks.

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:02.594
And full of himself.

00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:06.898
Write a letter that caters to
someone like that.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.901
Well, then.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.003
Good luck.

00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:24.983
-Shinoda.
-Yes?

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.985
Are you free to help me right now?

00:02:27.552 --> 00:02:30.255
I was going to tell you at the meeting,

00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:33.691
but I'm working on an interview
after talking to Mr. Murai.

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.660
-That right?
-Yes.

00:02:35.727 --> 00:02:37.295
-Never mind then.
-What?

00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:40.198
Good luck with landing the interview.

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:43.034
What?

00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:54.312
What was that smile?

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.346
Good luck.

00:02:55.847 --> 00:02:57.915
Mr. Murai did the same.

00:02:57.982 --> 00:02:58.916
Good luck.

00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:02.954
Kitahama Desk and Mr. Murai.

00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:08.059
Hold on.

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:11.396
What's wrong?

00:03:17.402 --> 00:03:18.569
I might be in trouble.

00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:32.717
-What is it?
-Don't you want it?

00:03:32.784 --> 00:03:34.185
I do!

00:03:35.553 --> 00:03:36.621
You're scaring me.

00:03:36.688 --> 00:03:41.225
The interview with Aoshiro I was
quietly working on at Mr. Murai's request.

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:42.226
Okay.

00:03:42.293 --> 00:03:44.295
Apparently, Kitahama Desk knew.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.101
In other words, Mr. Murai and Desk
have their eyes on it.

00:03:52.704 --> 00:03:54.238
This is a big deal.

00:03:55.173 --> 00:03:58.142
There must be some big secret
about Mr. Aoshiro.

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.145
I'm guessing they already
have a few leads.

00:04:01.212 --> 00:04:04.515
They're trying to get me
to meet him directly.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.285
But for what?

00:04:08.786 --> 00:04:09.654
Any ideas?

00:04:10.922 --> 00:04:16.427
Desk asked me the other day if I knew
anyone who's close to Seiya Aoshiro.

00:04:16.494 --> 00:04:18.496
Hold on. That's all he did.

00:04:18.563 --> 00:04:20.331
Something's definitely up.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.836
-It smells like a big story.
-Right?

00:04:25.503 --> 00:04:28.673
Mr. Murai and Kitahama Desk
both had these big smiles,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.608
and wished me luck.

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:32.443
-Huh?
-Right?

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:37.248
Those two only smile
if they're up to something.

00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:47.458
Hey… Can I eat this now?

00:04:50.128 --> 00:04:51.062
Hello?

00:05:02.106 --> 00:05:04.142
It's starting to get interesting.

00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:13.217
I actually got to say the phrase
I've been wanting to.

00:05:17.755 --> 00:05:18.756
Screw you!

00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:21.325
Do you have it out for him?

00:05:21.392 --> 00:05:23.628
Your shouting is disrupting our work.

00:05:23.694 --> 00:05:26.464
This isn't what we talked about!

00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:28.666
I understand your point.

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:32.403
I want you and your supervisor
at our office!

00:05:34.872 --> 00:05:35.807
Got it?

00:05:46.017 --> 00:05:48.386
Are you okay, Mr. Yamabuki?

00:05:49.187 --> 00:05:50.822
What happened?

00:05:51.856 --> 00:05:55.827
Kitahama Desk rewrote my article.

00:05:56.394 --> 00:05:57.228
What?

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.332
You're working on an interview?

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:04.068
You know that, too?

00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:06.337
Not the details.

00:06:07.205 --> 00:06:09.974
I'll tell you, because it might help you.

00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:12.443
Did you read the editorial?

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.978
Um…

00:06:14.045 --> 00:06:16.380
The politician Katsuya Sadamatsu, right?

00:06:16.447 --> 00:06:17.281
Correct.

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.283
That man is his aide.

00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:25.490
I interviewed him and his aide over dinner
about his political work.

00:06:26.624 --> 00:06:30.127
To my surprise, Sadamatsu
turned out to be clean and a good guy.

00:06:31.362 --> 00:06:34.432
But Desk got ahold of my draft
and changed it,

00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:36.634
turning it into a nasty piece.

00:06:37.702 --> 00:06:40.505
Why would he do that?

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.341
You know puff pieces?

00:06:45.276 --> 00:06:49.180
An article to help elevate the subject
and give them an advantage.

00:06:49.247 --> 00:06:50.081
That's right.

00:06:51.782 --> 00:06:52.984
Desk told me this.

00:06:57.488 --> 00:06:58.489
Why?

00:07:00.224 --> 00:07:02.560
We don't publish puff pieces.

00:07:03.461 --> 00:07:06.998
If we published that without hinting
that he's after voters,

00:07:07.064 --> 00:07:11.536
and the government used it for PR,
a lot of parties would start gloating.

00:07:13.037 --> 00:07:14.071
You get it?

00:07:17.008 --> 00:07:20.444
The Sengoku Weekly was about to get used.

00:07:33.724 --> 00:07:35.259
Desk avoided a fiasco.

00:07:36.494 --> 00:07:38.229
In the end, he saved me.

00:07:39.997 --> 00:07:41.332
He was a good guy in person.

00:07:41.966 --> 00:07:44.001
I truly wanted to root for him.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.941
I got to learn just how blind I was.

00:07:55.513 --> 00:07:58.382
So the lesson is,
we can't easily trust anyone.

00:07:59.183 --> 00:08:01.886
It's better to go in skeptical.

00:08:03.521 --> 00:08:06.057
Well, you have to be critical either way.

00:08:07.558 --> 00:08:09.460
Don't make any assumptions.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.265
Always remain neutral.

00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:18.436
It's hard to do, though.

00:08:20.805 --> 00:08:21.639
That's all.

00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:35.386
Always remain neutral.

00:08:37.989 --> 00:08:42.560
DEAR MR. SEIYA AOSHIRO
FORGIVE ME FOR…

00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:49.100
This is the Sengoku Weekly.

00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:51.435
Is Hinako Shinoda in?

00:08:52.436 --> 00:08:53.638
That's me.

00:08:54.138 --> 00:08:57.341
I'm Miyamoto, Seiya Aoshiro's assistant.

00:08:58.709 --> 00:09:00.544
I'm sorry for the sudden letter.

00:09:01.112 --> 00:09:05.149
Mr. Aoshiro appreciated
the thoughtful handwritten letter.

00:09:05.216 --> 00:09:07.718
He would love to do the interview.

00:09:07.785 --> 00:09:09.086
Thank you!

00:09:12.056 --> 00:09:17.428
I will create a proposal including
compensation and contact you again.

00:09:17.495 --> 00:09:19.997
Give my greetings to President Aoshiro.

00:09:20.064 --> 00:09:22.400
I will, look forward to hearing from you.

00:09:22.466 --> 00:09:23.668
Goodbye.

00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:30.107
He gave the okay!

00:09:30.174 --> 00:09:31.776
Nice one.

00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:33.711
-That's great.
-Not bad.

00:09:33.778 --> 00:09:36.380
Check and make sure
he's okay with photographs.

00:09:36.447 --> 00:09:37.314
Yes, sir.

00:09:41.585 --> 00:09:43.054
Seiya Aoshiro?

00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:44.722
That's amazing.

00:09:45.556 --> 00:09:48.359
He might like it if you wore
his brand for the day.

00:09:48.426 --> 00:09:49.493
That's a good idea!

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.328
-And pay for it yourself.
-Yes!

00:09:51.395 --> 00:09:52.496
I totally would.

00:09:52.563 --> 00:09:54.365
You're so pumped up.

00:09:54.432 --> 00:09:57.568
I'm worried things are going too well.

00:09:58.469 --> 00:10:00.938
Maybe that handwritten letter
really worked.

00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:06.177
Slow down a bit.

00:10:07.078 --> 00:10:08.245
Another one, please!

00:10:08.312 --> 00:10:10.614
Don't get sloppy drunk again!

00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:12.249
When did I ever get sloppy?

00:10:12.316 --> 00:10:14.418
When you got back from Niigata.

00:10:14.485 --> 00:10:16.420
Stupid Sengokusha!

00:10:16.487 --> 00:10:18.856
That's not my fault.

00:10:19.757 --> 00:10:21.625
My phone died,

00:10:21.692 --> 00:10:24.795
then I got lost in the rain,
and rang a doorbell.

00:10:24.862 --> 00:10:26.230
I know, you told me.

00:10:26.297 --> 00:10:29.867
Then I almost got eaten by a bear
in the sticks.

00:10:29.934 --> 00:10:31.669
The bear's a lie.

00:10:31.736 --> 00:10:32.737
Busted.

00:10:35.773 --> 00:10:37.308
Another one, please!

00:10:41.712 --> 00:10:43.080
A bear-repelling bell?

00:10:43.147 --> 00:10:44.115
Hina.

00:10:44.882 --> 00:10:48.619
I get you're happy to finally work
on your own project,

00:10:48.686 --> 00:10:50.421
but don't get carried away.

00:10:51.055 --> 00:10:52.156
Good point.

00:10:52.223 --> 00:10:54.792
Remember your favorite horror novel.

00:10:55.693 --> 00:10:56.827
Horror novel?

00:10:57.394 --> 00:11:00.030
The ones who screw around
get cursed first.

00:11:00.097 --> 00:11:01.499
Same thing here.

00:11:01.565 --> 00:11:04.268
Don't jinx me!

00:11:04.335 --> 00:11:07.438
Be careful when things seem
too good to be true.

00:11:07.505 --> 00:11:08.639
Seiya Aoshiro, right?

00:11:10.808 --> 00:11:13.644
Pretty roses have thorns.

00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:15.279
Hold on!

00:11:15.346 --> 00:11:17.181
What's lurking below the surface?

00:11:17.248 --> 00:11:20.017
Can you be a little more reassuring?

00:11:20.084 --> 00:11:21.819
Good medicine tastes bitter.

00:11:21.886 --> 00:11:25.823
The schemer is undone by his own schemes.
Too much of a good thing.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.691
That's all negative, Asuka!

00:11:27.758 --> 00:11:28.526
Bathroom!

00:11:31.162 --> 00:11:32.496
Sorry!

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.965
How are you drunk already?

00:11:35.032 --> 00:11:36.667
Sorry. Thank you.

00:11:38.602 --> 00:11:39.570
The PR zine.

00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:41.906
You're still involved?

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.241
No, but why does that matter?

00:11:47.711 --> 00:11:50.147
You're carrying around
your former department's work?

00:11:50.214 --> 00:11:53.551
Why are you being so harsh to me today?

00:11:54.051 --> 00:11:55.886
Sorry, I'm kidding.

00:11:56.487 --> 00:11:58.322
Anyway, do your best.

00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:59.790
I'm rooting for you.

00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:03.627
Thank you. I'll do my best.

00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:07.097
What about the bathroom?

00:12:07.731 --> 00:12:08.566
Bathroom?

00:12:21.879 --> 00:12:23.347
Good morning.

00:12:23.414 --> 00:12:25.850
-Good morning…
-Wow.

00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:27.151
Nice.

00:12:27.218 --> 00:12:28.385
Looks good on you.

00:12:28.452 --> 00:12:30.120
It's Mr. Aoshiro's brand.

00:12:30.187 --> 00:12:31.322
That's great.

00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:33.057
If you please.

00:12:36.627 --> 00:12:38.395
Is the interview ready?

00:12:38.462 --> 00:12:42.833
Yes, I had Kitahama Desk
look over the questions yesterday.

00:12:44.435 --> 00:12:45.569
It's just…

00:12:47.771 --> 00:12:49.306
You want to ask me something.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:58.382
You seem to have some thoughts
on Seiya Aoshiro, don't you?

00:13:00.784 --> 00:13:02.152
It's not that I don't.

00:13:02.953 --> 00:13:06.624
But I don't have enough evidence
to merit telling you now.

00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:10.294
Some bad rumors about him, right?

00:13:10.895 --> 00:13:11.662
Yes.

00:13:12.897 --> 00:13:15.132
I did some research online,

00:13:15.633 --> 00:13:17.101
but didn't find anything.

00:13:18.168 --> 00:13:21.572
The facts are that he did
revitalize the company.

00:13:22.573 --> 00:13:25.776
He may have a talent for business.

00:13:26.477 --> 00:13:29.313
And as you can see,
he's charismatic and attractive.

00:13:31.715 --> 00:13:35.886
Is it better if I don't know
the true objective of today's interview?

00:13:40.357 --> 00:13:42.126
Sorry for not being forthcoming.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.497
But all you have to do
is conduct a smooth interview.

00:13:47.097 --> 00:13:47.965
I swear.

00:13:48.532 --> 00:13:51.135
Just creating a connection with him
would be big.

00:13:52.803 --> 00:13:53.704
I see.

00:13:54.538 --> 00:14:01.111
It would be even more amazing if you
could exchange personal numbers with him.

00:14:02.613 --> 00:14:03.681
Me?

00:14:05.316 --> 00:14:06.483
With this hot guy?

00:14:07.051 --> 00:14:08.218
Provided it’s possible.

00:14:08.285 --> 00:14:10.421
If the opportunity presents itself.

00:14:13.657 --> 00:14:17.261
Have a snack ready and try to
make him lower his guard beforehand.

00:14:18.462 --> 00:14:21.532
Suzaki is already upstairs,
getting set up.

00:14:21.598 --> 00:14:23.300
You can ask him for advice.

00:14:24.802 --> 00:14:25.669
Okay.

00:14:27.771 --> 00:14:28.872
You going?

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.776
I'll get the room ready
and wait for him outside early.

00:14:33.944 --> 00:14:35.012
I'm off then.

00:14:40.985 --> 00:14:41.819
Almost forgot.

00:14:43.854 --> 00:14:48.392
Even if you happen to notice or
realize something in the middle of it,

00:14:48.459 --> 00:14:50.361
try to keep your poker face.

00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.963
Okay.

00:14:54.064 --> 00:14:55.799
All right, good luck then.

00:14:55.866 --> 00:14:56.834
Thank you!

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.076
Good morning, I'm Shinoda.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.745
I apologize for the inconvenience.

00:15:41.812 --> 00:15:44.014
Not at all, I look forward to today.

00:15:45.449 --> 00:15:47.418
You really did come alone.

00:15:47.985 --> 00:15:48.819
Yes.

00:15:49.353 --> 00:15:51.755
I do things alone when I can.

00:15:51.822 --> 00:15:53.357
I even took the subway.

00:15:54.158 --> 00:15:56.360
I didn't even miss my transfer.

00:15:56.427 --> 00:15:57.995
YOUNG BUSINESSMAN
SEIYA AOSHIRO

00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:02.166
-Let me lead the way.
-Sure.

00:16:17.514 --> 00:16:18.348
Ms. Shinoda.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:20.751
Drinks.

00:16:21.885 --> 00:16:23.287
Is coffee okay?

00:16:23.353 --> 00:16:24.188
Thank you.

00:16:28.725 --> 00:16:31.762
Do you two know each other?

00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:34.865
Yes, we often work together
on the Incident Team.

00:16:34.932 --> 00:16:35.999
Incident Team?

00:16:36.066 --> 00:16:39.036
Well, to be exact, I'm a freelancer.

00:16:39.103 --> 00:16:41.872
But I do most of Sengoku Weekly's shoots.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.277
Usually a cameraman from the Photo
Department gets sent to interviews,

00:16:47.344 --> 00:16:50.747
but Mr. Suzaki was swapped in
last minute for this.

00:16:50.814 --> 00:16:51.715
Ms. Shinoda.

00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:55.586
Check if he needs milk or sugar.

00:16:56.987 --> 00:16:58.422
I'll take it black.

00:16:58.489 --> 00:16:59.323
Okay.

00:17:00.457 --> 00:17:03.093
-You two help yourselves as well.
-Thank you.

00:17:04.394 --> 00:17:06.797
I'm fine, why don't you have a cup?

00:17:06.864 --> 00:17:07.731
Sure.

00:17:10.601 --> 00:17:13.170
So you mostly take scandal photos.

00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:16.073
No, I take all sorts of photos.

00:17:16.807 --> 00:17:21.211
Our chief sent me here
since Shinoda's still a newbie.

00:17:22.613 --> 00:17:24.448
I figured that was the case.

00:17:24.515 --> 00:17:25.983
They're worried about you.

00:17:26.783 --> 00:17:28.018
Eyes forward.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.921
Sorry.

00:17:30.988 --> 00:17:33.290
-Please be careful, it's hot.
-Thank you.

00:17:37.294 --> 00:17:40.998
You're kind, Ms. Shinoda,
just like in you were in your letter.

00:17:41.064 --> 00:17:44.902
I'm curious to know
where your warm character comes from.

00:17:44.968 --> 00:17:46.069
Oh, no…

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.338
Maybe I'll interview you instead.

00:17:49.473 --> 00:17:50.908
Where are you from?

00:17:51.542 --> 00:17:52.543
Rural Chiba.

00:17:54.178 --> 00:17:56.547
Were you running around
in the fields as a kid?

00:17:56.613 --> 00:17:59.116
I wasn't that much of a tomboy.

00:18:00.384 --> 00:18:02.653
You're from Niigata, right?

00:18:03.687 --> 00:18:04.988
What were you like?

00:18:08.392 --> 00:18:10.494
I loved sports.

00:18:11.261 --> 00:18:13.497
There were many big parks around.

00:18:15.432 --> 00:18:17.568
Have you been to Niigata before?

00:18:18.235 --> 00:18:19.069
I have!

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.438
To ski or snowboard?

00:18:21.505 --> 00:18:23.040
No, for work.

00:18:23.674 --> 00:18:26.043
A month ago, but it was a short visit.

00:18:26.977 --> 00:18:28.245
Kota Kubozuka.

00:18:28.312 --> 00:18:31.048
In his teenage years,
he caused an assault case.

00:18:31.114 --> 00:18:33.850
I want you to check
their Niigata residence.

00:18:34.585 --> 00:18:36.820
Your work was crucial.

00:18:37.387 --> 00:18:41.358
Even if you happen to notice or
realize something in the middle of it,

00:18:41.959 --> 00:18:43.527
try to keep your poker face.

00:18:46.096 --> 00:18:47.030
You okay?

00:18:49.066 --> 00:18:49.933
I'm sorry.

00:18:51.235 --> 00:18:52.202
Did it get on your clothes?

00:18:53.804 --> 00:18:55.739
I'll go use the restroom.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.251
Is Mr. Aoshiro involved in the serial
accidental deaths?

00:19:08.118 --> 00:19:09.453
Is it a coincidence?

00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:13.423
No, hold on.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.559
Mr. Aoshiro?

00:19:16.126 --> 00:19:17.761
You should request an interview.

00:19:17.828 --> 00:19:21.331
Mr. Suzaki was swapped in
last minute for this.

00:19:22.099 --> 00:19:24.735
So you mostly take scandal photos.

00:19:26.036 --> 00:19:27.304
It's not a coincidence!

00:19:27.804 --> 00:19:30.007
How did I not notice until now?

00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:32.109
I'm so stupid!

00:19:32.175 --> 00:19:33.844
How can I be so slow?

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.280
Pretty roses have thorns.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.683
The guy's way greedier than he looks.

00:19:45.022 --> 00:19:49.393
Mr. Aoshiro is connected
to the serial mysterious deaths.

00:19:50.594 --> 00:19:52.429
Something's set in motion.

00:19:52.963 --> 00:19:55.699
I feel like I'm getting dragged
into something again.

00:19:55.766 --> 00:19:58.368
Things are getting interesting!

00:19:58.435 --> 00:20:01.204
No picture, no real name,
won't answer the phone.

00:20:01.271 --> 00:20:03.607
What if I end up with a boyfriend?

00:20:03.674 --> 00:20:06.009
